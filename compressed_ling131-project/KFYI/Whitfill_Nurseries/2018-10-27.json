{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Putting together a trade planet and reviewing your trade plan and reviewing your trades against or trade plant\nWho could help motivate you who can keep you on the right track who can keep you moving forward we have a tremendous amount of resources available for that\nBecause it's the key to the whole thing you can't learn how to do this out of a book you can't learn this from CDs could you learn magical indicators sure\nBut then I'm going to ask you how do you know which is a hundred and fifty indicators to use on any given trade how do you know which of the infinite available parameters you should use in this given trade\nAnd the short answer is you don't\nThe indicators work until they don't and the reality is these things generally are have about fifty percent or less probability rating so how is that going to be the foundation of a successful set of strategies especially when most of them have terrible if any risk management which again from a knowledge perspective is key\nWe can help motivate you we can keep you on the right path\nAnd that is critically important when I started learning to trade I went through a lot of hotel seminars and sometimes the information was okay a lot of times it was junk a lot of times it's hard to tell the difference\nBut when you left there then you look at something and say but it's this one of these were this one of those and there wasn't anyone to ask\nAgain we have an entire ... part of our staff\nThat all they do is work with students they have no sales responsibilities they have no no quotas targets anything else\nThey are they're simply to ensure your success\nAnd if you go back to why do we have five stars out of five stars of the better Business Bureau why do we have four point nine out of five stars on Google Plus why do we have out of the you know all of our students when do surveys why is it that Ninety seven point seven two percent of Phoenix students\nRate at their experience with us either four or five stars\nAgain we don't pay for reviews we don't have a bad reputation management firm we don't give people discounts when they write nice things about us\nWhat we do is we do what we say we're going to do one of things I always say to people is\nBecause we are local because we have a campus in Scottsdale you know where to find us we're accountable to you in a way that nobody else is\nIf we say we're going to do something we're going to do it I grew up in a world that if you told someone you are going to do something and you didn't do it they would show up at your house and beat you until you get that one of the world I grow up and\nIf you don't come and physically beat us again I expect you to say nasty things about us on line\nAnd the reason that we don't have that is because we do do what we say we're going to do now we also are very direct with you you got to do your part okay if you don't follow through if you're not disciplined if you're not motivated if you can't\nFocus and and and put together a trade playing again with our help will he be tremendous help in that and you're with all due respect you are going to need that help because there's a lot more to those trade plans on what people realize\nBut you've got to get out from you know in front of the TV and sit down and do this and part of this becomes\nJust first understanding are you serious about achieving your financial goals what are they\nMost people's financial goals consist of roughly of I Want to be comfortable in retirement I Want to be financially secure well what does that mean if you don't put a number to to add\nHow do you know if you are on track for it and so we work with you on ideas like that as well and and it all comes down to how serious argue about achieving your financial goals\nAnd the sad fact is the vast majority of people on ...\n... the reason that most people don't achieve their financial goals is it never really set them\nAnd then they never actually do what's required to meet them and the you know as thorough said most men lead lives of quiet desperation at some point in their\nPeople just kind of get focused on making it to the finish line and they're trying to survive and and they exist instead of to live\nAnd the markets are a great opportunity to achieve financial goals to actually live but they're not the only alternative you may decide on real estate you may decide to own your own business\nBut every one of these things is going to require some commitment on your part some effort on your part if you actually want to succeed and because of the people we haven't students support we can sit down with you and talk to you about your goals we can put together a plan of how you can achieve those goals we again for them\nOh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold him back out again on hold on ... ...\nYou know Bruce if your butcher things this time of year they're not going to have any chance at all any growing season left to respond and even put out decent foliage so for most plants I I Would say this is not a good time to prune your about a month late\nOr you know realistically be better off leaving them big in color and and printing 'em heavy in the spring after the frost the first of march or so\nOh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\nFrom tree that relates to the mall or say hey ... what I Hope all the time I\nTravel all all the mole on on a wall knows all\nBranches that are already there can possibly start turning\nVersus the best time to do that would be wait until January when a storm it\nUm so you probably you know I'm not giving you a lot to do this weekend Bruce but realistically with that big tree you wanted to butcher back and cutting back heavy is a great thing to do what you want to do that in January and and the other trick with fixes it's the only plant I Know that absolutely love cow manure\nSo after you cut it back in January work a bag of cow manure and around it and stand back it'll come back with a vengeance in the spring\nOr call bought a cool ... all all all softball or all all all show up on our own\nPoll whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa you know it's kind it's kind of a time of year we can leave that but the nice part about it is Bruce is that we have quarterly pickups in the city of Phoenix and and the next time when they pick up will be a great time to ... and different things but really for major printing this time of year it's it's not the right time\nYou know most of us want to go so here's what I Would do I would just be a really nice guy and buy all the guys good ... lunch and then have them do some different work\nBoth on\nFibers ah let's see next step we've got branch Dover in queen creek good morning branch\nHi how're you doing good sir hey thanks\nFor taking my call I have a question I've got a two probably Thirteen fourteen year old sister trees that we just cut down there about eight feet away from the foundation of our how my thought is I'm ... she says how can up everywhere so we cut the trees down with the best way to kill the stumps\nOr let though there are some chemicals you can put on the stump civil helped kill the stumps but that's not going to necessarily kill the roots sitter regenerating out on the lawn area especially ah do you want to let them grow to some height\nGet 'em up three to four feet tall and then a lot spraying with life phosphate which is like round up or finale and a lot spraying with a pretty heavy dose why phosphate that'll kinda kill them if you can get them if they shoot sorority up decent size it'll work very well this time of year if not you might have to wait to spring to kill those shoots\nOkay do I need to do anything with a stump at all or can I just leave those will they die in their own\nWell it's better to grind them down if you don't write them down below the soil and get rid of them they're going to regenerate and come back up so any any stump you have on assist you above the soil\nIs going to regenerate ethic are like we\nMay grow fast they get big trees that the story is is when you have a boy child then do you plan on this issue and when he's old enough to get married he builds the house\n[laughter] well that's just about what's happened here already gone up quite a bit thank you so much thank you Bye bye or J. over in Sun City good morning Jay\nGood morning Brian enjoy your show have two questions or is it feasible to use ... leaves and the compost\nYeah you could I mean you know they they are organic ... will compost but um so you could certainly do that you're going to have to add some nitrogen to them and some moisture and probably smaller denser material or are you going to use that come boasts just to to you know feed plants with her what\nYes garden well vegetable garden I probably wouldn't specify Olien has been the best broad you know there's a lot of other things you could use as well\nSo I probably wouldn't put them into my vegetable garden even though I don't think there's any toxicity would pass on once they're broken down south they're really composting is not going to hurt anything at all but you have to take them to the whole compost process you know when you make compost you have to add nitrogen and you have to add moisture and you have to turn it\nSo if you can write them down into compost that'd be fine that'd be safe but you have to break 'em all the way down\nThe second question I have an orange tree it's about twenty five years old and this year it doesn't have one single or John\nYou always saying farm and there's always next year Jay but it uh it's been a rough year for some of the citrus crop Zaman is not as many fruit on some different varieties and it's a more\nClimatic than anything else you know we didn't really have any cold weather in the winter time and we had some very windy high temperature early and ah if it's a naval oranges an alternate bearer so you know just live life well next year should be there on year\nOkay hey thank you very much\nChanged ... by by a James down in the sand hand ballet good morning James\nMartin and how you doing great I'm never up this early to talk garden so [laughter] this is a rarity for us um couple of ... I got\nI got two questions one of our system but that's later I have a proximate six by six garden um now I normally grow I always has a success but NATO's\nMuch much taken off right now as a matter of fact um but other things like um oh a ... uh snow peas or collard greens or Christmas coming up we love collard greens at Christmas but\nThey reached the point where they get about a foot high for maybe about eight inches and then they they know weeks\nAh no oil might not be quite good enough James you probably want to include corporate a little bit more organic nitrogen in there and if you you know in a garden\nLike how do I do take some time with your cake works works some chicken manure into your garden and the thing when you use um chicken manure where it's not a quick release is it a little slower release if you had chicken there was this fresh from a chicken coop it's got a lot more\nA nitrogen if but when you buy composting chicken manure it takes a while for the bacteria to break it down and the nitrogen release so if you incorporated in advance of planting a guard and you'll get better results so some chicken we knew ... put it in soon\nWhat does that called again\nJust chicken manure it's composting chicken waste it works it works very well is available and it's kind of a great thing to use but it takes a while for the nitrogen you release so you want to put it in right away\nIt's called chicken chicken manure yup\nOkay All right they're not as I got an air force pilot check 'em out there and kind of the other question I have on a on a stretch to can I use them for years for compost sure that that little guy he's huge but he sheds like nobody's business [noise]\nAnd that will that systemic it'll go down to the plant system and go down and kill the route and at that point that you could put your artificial turf and the other options just dig down a dig those roots out but what they're doing is they're generating water spout back off of the roots that spread across you know before the tree was taken out\nNow can I got into the room in in ... some type of a\nNot very well I mean you really either digging out the roots that are close to the surface or else you're letting the roots grow so that you can poison them through the foliage which is systemic and goes down and kill ... okay\nYou know if if you had the at the plants\nAre three foot tall right now you could probably just time of year put on one application and get rid of those routes but ah with with plants six inches tall they are not going to take enough why phosphate into the roots to kill them so you're going to have to let him get some size first\nOkay all righty\nThank max by by uh we're gonna take a short while we're gone we are three lines open the number to call six so two to six o five three night for this is Brian and Carlos here with ... regarding show on five fifty KFYI or anywhere in the planet heart radio Doris in Tempe you're up next\nSlowed down safely steer away and get off the roadway at night drive defensively and be aware of what's ahead and around you and if you see a sign warning of a runway driver safely move toward and take the next freeway exit on the\nRival where get better sponsored by the Arizona department of transportation in partnership with the Arizona broadcasters association and visitation\nLearn real we know the car wreck still take the weekends often neither do we have you been in a car wreck or over the weekend you don't have to wait till Monday to get serious\n\nSlowly beautiful Saturday morning books welcome back to the\nDonor cigars show hey we've got three open lines get Carl us a call the number to call six though two to six o five three nine four we can talk about anything you want to grow water plant fertilize skill how to use water how did check our irrigation systems guess what the mornings or getting cooler\nDon't need water every day that's for sure and we've had the great benefit of some rain which were not accustomed to end it sleeps out a lot of the ... so if we keep up a good fertilizer and the good watery pattern this time of year we can space are watering is out a lot and we can use a lot less water we can leave it up in the reservoirs\nAnd we can grow some really healthy plants are number to call six so two to six o five three nine four to six oh KFYI Dolores in Tempe good morning ...\nGood morning thanks so much for being on the radio and sharing your knowledge with you with everybody and thank you for saying we can talk about everything because I have a problem that a little bit outside the box it's about church\nI rented a house and I knew they had a dog I didn't know they had ... [noise] and now the soil now to put it lightly ... you know if anything that I can do to take away\nUm you know basically if you turn the soil over an add some gypsum to it so this is like in a whole yard Dolores you just bought the home\n[noise] um actually it's not the whole yard their patio in the middle of it so it's really just the surrounding thing I'm a surrounding side or the yard\nYeah feel it's your turn the soil all over the edge you have some uh that will help tremendously in deep irrigated very well it should take care most you're probably\nOkay I'm when I'm adding chips and couldn't tell me about a kind of a ratio that I should\nYou want to put it on pretty heavy so like he comes typically in fifty pound bags so fifty pound bags for say every two hundred square feet\nThank you so much in life\nAnd it will make a big difference it'll make the soil drain better up get rid of this the odors and or should help balance the slow back are you going to plant a new plants there\n[laughter] I might um it's really not that big it's only maybe ... ... ... patio and a block wall around it it's a townhouse\nOkay so if you take that gypsum and just spread\nIt out just you know kind of that ratio fifty pounds for two hundred square feet sailing might only need one bag and then just turn it over to a shovel adapt and then throw a hose on in that plant are illiterate running just blood that whole planet for three or four inches of water so leach down deep and don't take care of your problem\nWhat to do anything if I put it on the stunt men what they do anything to take away the snow on the ... you\nKnow the ... you might be better off treating with like little bleach\nOkay you know bleach does a great bleachers pretty phenomenal you know we we process citrus and do things but you know for killing bacteria and smell you know it's really hard to beat bleach you know and it takes ... smell for a day or so but you know bleach really does a fantastic job of cleaning that up\nBut we appreciate you\nThank you Lawrence have assigned we can\nGet you out by a car down in Maricopa good morning coral\n[noise] morning right I've got a [laughter] and\nI have I've fertilized and with me arrested [noise] it it has in it and change color regularly for life about once a month\nA crowd or using it full you're using it in the soil\nWhich is\nWhat here's what I Would you number one I Would check too watery make sure they're not staying too wet high discuss this time of year that are ... that they'd been in the ground more than six months to be watered about once a week\nAnd they're going to take over my goodness you ought to remember that I Know it's okay [noise] they're going to come back Karl but\nIf you want your fertilizer to release better uh when you have problems with a plant like that they can take it up better if you put it on ... so if you spray it on the forward John Hi discussed this time of year it'll take it up better so here's what I Would do I go ahead and fertilizing with your ... one time on the phone was right now\nAnd a flood flood the garden real well and then go out and check the soil trendy irrigation off and it's still the grounds pretty bone dry the top two inches don't water again\n[noise] [noise] that more than likely is is my issue is 'cause\nYou know sometimes too much love not a good thing\n[noise] that's obvious you know since they were tropical plant I thought that they would take her unlimited\nWell you know what's fun Carl's here in our desert climate you know the difference between like ... years here and then when you go to a wire Florida they actually perform you know better here planted in the ground than they do in those places because we do have less humidity and drier air we getting nicer blooms and they do\nOkay so then I Would have to look into a problem with watering you're maybe somebody spraying some type or herbicides around the soil because even though it's hot and we have monsoons in the least can get you know burned torn up and those kinda things it should be coming back out right now so I I Would look for another problem other than the win\nOK okay thank you thank you Bye bye a Mike in Chandler good morning Michael good morning how are you rates are\nUh my question I bought a house about a year ago and it puts a school actually have revitalized at that time in a couple of countries don't know much about you know trees in class\nBut somebody had told me that way for the weather is true that if you could have palm tree at a certain point in time ... of course the ... that you will get those things are the areas that dropping out of the cool\nIs that correct or very correct Mike and what you want to do in probably the most palm trees here in the desert or this goes for Mexican and California fans and date palms or you want to print them on the fourth of July\nSo if you mark your calendar for the fourth of July you presume that time of year you won't have any more seed heads are flowering or if you've heard of many sooner than that you can still have some more flowering come out of the tree that you might not have anticipated it might look like you were moving all the flowers stocks but you haven't\nSo the best time to print palm trees really here's after the fourth of July any time in the month of July usually then you've removed all the flowers stocks and they haven't dropped anything yet\nOkay to bottom line I think I'm pretty much stuck in jail about next flight and\nWrite well you'd have flowers stocks too young to now you mean it's messy yeah yeah I I Would printed again now and then leave it leave it alone and then not permanent again 'cause you know if you have a lot of seeds and literature is going to continue to fall for the next couple of months so go ahead and print 'em off right now and then leave it in the next year don't printed again until after the fourth of July\nOkay one second or a quick question I've got some voices in the fact they're really really call them each one of them they're kind of like ... and they looked like they have kind of an ... agree I don't know what what they're actually are they do they say they're like a tree\nThere probably are divided as Mike or they could be junior first but they both have a little buried with a strong set with especially when they're wet and get the dust off on\nOne second call and the other hand them brown spots throughout that credit compromise in the letter on the show water can take care of it I Can't figure out a case that crowd or something that they should do that just\nIs the one is a center is it more shaded\nI Know they're both they're both ... about three feet away from each other\nOkay um yeah what what are you probably you could fertilize it yeah but not going to make a whole you could fertilizer right now is not going to hurt a juniper these are like three or four foot tall Bush's berries on him\nAs much availability but if you can find the varieties you're looking for this is the best time to plant some\nWhen you have them\nWe have some we we have a limited selection because of the time of year but we yeah we do have a very fair selection stone fruits\nWhich what's your lecture which nursery should I go to\nWell where where do you live in Scottsdale Henry\nMy cactus and a ...\nProbably the easiest one to go to the one in eight street in Glendale avenue\nAnd were\nEight street in Glendale Glendale is the same as Lincoln and were eight twenty four east Glendale\nOkay got it lasted not reach several times you've mentioned a recommended Sandy loan mhm I I can find it\nWhere do well Sandy llamas our most common soil here in the valley there's a lot of different cell types but it's the most common and in your neighborhood you shouldn't you know your soil should be fine you're not you're far enough out or it's this shouldn't be real heavy clay so your soil should be fine [noise]\nWhat I'm going to do is remove three large trees on my lawn ... and over the years it's some come down six to eight inches where the trees were okay I Will never all that out and I heard and read and maybe you do not recommend that are using the loan for that\nYeah no just Sandy loan or just a good regular soil I mean if you could just by dirt you know that for like a pioneer one of the suppliers those guys will have soil that she'd worked fine for what your knees are four\nAnd a do have different ... or ... qualities you\nIf you if you're trying to fill holes in a lawn like that you just want to buy what you I Would probably call at topsoil\nAlright\nOkay but you don't want to buy a blended topsoil Henry you want to buy a which just straight soil so some people soil they call it top selling its a blend of mulch and soil you want to buy the soil only\nRight okay so I'm On a ... look for Katie regard to talk to people about something like ... pitches okay\nAll righty thanks entering don't you start by by her program to qualify by Barry in Phoenix good morning Barry\nGood morning and looking at a I'm trying to put a type of tree ended up front yard and I I was looking up um a blue Chinese what Sherrie ... G. E. R. I.\nWith Syria now we grow that here more as a fine\nSo else has really not going to be a tree\nAnd it's not as easy to grow into three for ... would say if you lived up in Prescott or pacing or somewhere\n[noise] uh [noise] what about like the engine for the American center\nFor ... it's a little bit hot here for ... there's some growing around the valley but they're not going to be very easy to grow so we do self ... who used to be the most common variety and there's there are certainly delicious but uh of all of all the fruit so we grow here ... or one of the more difficult they really don't like our summer heat\n[noise] you know I got a plan maybe on the east side of the house\nThat would be a great location for it if you had on the east side of the house and even their Barry if you plan to do with some ground cover underneath that they took away the reflected heat you know there there is some certainly some nice quality ... here in town but they're not as easy to grow here as they would be in a cooler climate\nOkay I think so much\nThank you very by by um you know a few other small trees that you know with purple flowers or you might look at a ... and you might also look at a desert will as a kind of magenta color and the crate Myrtle is you can get in a blue or Brent in Chandler good morning Brandt\nBig warning\nA quick question I've got a couple of a bad that uh unfortunately I was a little bit lazy this summer and got 'em overrun with 'em or near the grass and I want to replant them there\nBut I just don't know how the easiest way to kill the grass and then you know make sure the soil can cake for other stuff I Want to plant so\nI mean do you want to plant and now you want to plant in the spring\n[noise] uh probably this plane\nOkay so what I Would use is a product called finale\nF. I. N. A. L. E. and not for the I'm Sorry not\nNuts forget that forget the finale when I Want to use for now and a vegetable garden but she's a product called few so later over the top\nOkay okay and it\nComes to use a way it is the one the manufacturers name over the top as a brand name you might find it in ...\nBut that's um systemic a herbicide that goes right through the plant that won't affect any of your vegetables at all but will kill the grasses so if you spray that right now and now it's an excellent time to spray it because the plant the grasses\nFor ... for the wintertime so if you spray at this time of year with the contract herbicide like that will go in and killed the roots and then you can clean it out in January and replant\nGreat and that it ...\nIt should be available pretty much every you know one of the ... one of the names either under a few so laid or the the um a furlough brand is over the top\nOK okay\nThank you Bye bye bye\nOh let's see where to take a short break while we're gone we have three open lines folks that number to call six so two to six o five three nine for this is Brian and Carlos here with with donors regarding show on five fifty KFYI or anywhere in the plant is an eye heart radio maybe\nWe\n\n\nCan all the\n\nMoney is going to\nWhen\n[noise] when\n\n\nI was like well\nYou know this year with the weather this nice you know we have the best weather in the country the best growing\nWeather on the planet today forecasted Ninety One and sixty four\nThere that's the most ideal growing climate for flowers and vegetables that exist doesn't get any better than those folks welcome back to its on this regard show we do have a line open the number to call six so two to six o five three nine four Gloria good morning\n[noise] hello Hi Gloria how you doing ... ... I talk to you last Saturday I have that kind treated I planted in Seventy nine ...\nBack at the end of September after those hard when the plank we'll turn [noise] uh well I fell off the tree and the yard and then and then they turn around and I yeah I didn't catch the last ... pictures at my tree which I text you cannot them\nAnd I got it twice this week waiting for a response if I can read you have an eight that tree\nYou know gory I honestly doubt that you can you know if it's all turned brown and it's probably dead especially if it turned Brown in the summertime not in the spring\nBut uh even with spraying with ... like round up in those kinds of things\nIt's not going to work that well it will work probably best so this time of year and if you want to get a decent kill on it what you want to do take your chemicals they use and mix it with a little bit of spreaders sticker which could be like dish soap and add a little bit of fertilizer to it\nFor example a little miracle grow our water soluble fertilizer and then she'll do those two things will get a better kill but it is a very very you know hearty plant the does well your eye on what's a good\nWeekend growing up I ended up with a possible\nBut the other way to eliminate a Betty's keep your past remote for a year okay\nYou know but when you're trying to grow up past rep for animals that's kind of difficult so it it's not easy it's a tough one but you know it's a little diligent you can get rid of it but it's not something you're going to get rid of the season it'll probably take years for a no attention to get rid of it\nYeah ... Bye bye Bye bye\nWell ready to take a short break we're Carlos you're on the phone to music and give them a cold during the break folks number to call six so two to six o five three Ninety four to six do KFYI which Brian and Carlos ... with the soldiers regarding showing five fifty KFYI or anywhere in the planted I heart radio\n\nAlone\nBeing in the same\nThe name of the game\n\n\nDream of\nMom a rising\nChina and\n\nWe've got Carlos horse around the studio\nWill come back to the owners should garden showing this beautiful morning folks absolutely gorgeous out there and a great day to be here in Arizona and are Being American anyway\nWell I've got three lines open the number to call six so two to six o five three nine four and give us a call we could talk about your dreams that perfect landscape gardening wanna grow water plant fertilized\nWants to style lots of things to do and uh you know there's nothing more beautiful and a garden in diversity we plant a garden that just has one kind of tree in it it's pretty boring anyway Don in paradise valley good morning Donna\nI Try and um I can tell that ice on February ... however a star orange game than I'm fat truck here agree with that\nWell Donna October is a little late\nSo usually what we do Valentine's Day Memorial Day Labor Day\nSo that's going to be like the first to September you know late may and Fifteen to February or ... or\nI should not hurt right now\nWell it's not going to benefit most of the desert plants in citrus it's definitely too late so I Would just hold off any more fertilizer now and put it on in February\nAnd a Valentine Memorial Day labor Labor Day huh All right you're what thank\nYou thank you Bye bye I ah David Mesa good morning David\nHow're you doing racer\nQuick question for you so I planted a Roma tomatoes and the spring and they came up on I had a great crop\nAnd then throughout the summer I kind of shady porch but they also got attacked by a bleach maybe ... I could leave early and not only am I better off to just rip them out of the ground a request Springer can I just traveled back and see what happens\nIf you just chop back tomatoes they really don't come back and fruit again so you'd be better\nOkay yeah I mean I just I change him out you know and and it's amazing how we can keep tomatoes here year after year but some of the other varieties would do better for you if you wanted to grow like sweet one hundreds or cherries those kinds of tomatoes those you can keep year after year but when you cut back tomatoes they don't come back and perform the same way so you know you really can't cut tomatoes back\nOkay that's great thank you sir Bye bye a day or the next step we got Robert Sawyer good morning Robert\nGood morning I have a question I I had a a cotton wood tree that I removed from my front yard and it's and it's right next to one of those techniques that they believe um I Can't get grass\nTo grow in that area for some reason I even put I put that ruled saw it on there and then the dog died I'm just curious what I can do for that section of oil ... there are some treatment joy ... that dirt\nNo you shouldn't have to Robert I mean I can understand where the ... when it was a lie was sucking all the nutrients out that probably that area doesn't have as many nutrients is rest yard because the cottonwood roots are\nPretty effective in in growing and taking as much water and nutrients they can but it shouldn't present a long term problem for you I Would probably just chill that area pretty well maybe a little bit of organic material and some fertilizer I think it'll be fine\nThank you thank you very much\nThanks Robert have a nice weekend but by\nA pet in Glendale good morning pat\nHer more and Brian or enjoy the show a pilot for asking to repeat yourself but you were talking about the limit Bermuda grass in the garden mhm with the ... ... did you say you\nKnow few so late F.
