houses is\n... ... real estate mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again a big key and the top when you have this much margin debt what happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nTo you borrowed the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing\nCapacity so you don't actually have to solve the stocks so all this money gets created and that creates demand\nNow at the same time companies are buying back thrown stock which is limiting supply so this pushes stock prices up and you have this ... this virtuous cycle\nAs people get more borrowing capacity that borrow more money they don't have anything else to do with the money 'cause nothing else was give them a decent rate of return so they keep buying more and more stocks but\nWhat always happens in these cycles is it that when the fed starts raising interest rates then all of a sudden the margin that doesn't become as attractive as it used to be actually so I think today that if you're borrowing less than about fifty granted Schwab on margin right now it's costing you nine to ten percent\nOkay that's a big number and all of a sudden that isn't as attractive as stocks aren't going up so fast you combine that with again you know a big change in the house in ... this fall and all of a sudden the social mood starts changing\nPeople aren't as optimistic there's not as much confidence it's two years of what you've just been through on the Kavanaugh hearings only is going to feature Mr Trump and everybody he knows\nNow again you may think that's what should happen and that's all fine you're into that opinion and I'm not here to argue it one way or the other but I'm going to tell you is going to have a tremendous impact on the stock market because all of this revolves around confidence and it will be crushing the confidence and the fact that may be a strategic move by the people on the other side\nBecause if the economy's not doing well it's going to be a whole lot harder for the Republicans to win and twenty twenty but that's kind of the big view on all of this the smaller view is that\nYou've got very little cash left on the sidelines is getting more expensive for people to borrow money to buy stocks and when that happens people stop borrowing so much that takes away demand when you take away demand that when companies have to borrow at pay more to borrow money to buy back their own stock\nWhen mortgages go up and now housing prices have to come down to reflect the increase in mortgage rates all of a sudden the economy starts turning that turns very quickly and again in two thousand and eight when the market crashed it last forty percent of its value in a month\nIt was Thirteen Years of gains in Eighteen months\nThat is very likely in my opinion something on that magnitude is inevitable I can tell you when it's going to start but I can tell you you're seeing a lot of signs of the top right now now companies may continue to buy back their stock next year because they haven't spent all the repatriated money\nBut earnings are starting to get weaker this quarter GDP forecaster being lowered around the world\nYes you've gotten through the NAFTA deal but you still have a lot of issues with China Italy's a basket case and they're going to have big problems with the emu and you may end up with another group wanting to Italy may want to leave the EU sometime this year\nAll of these things can take this market down very quickly and getting back to the first idea people always tell me that their investors and I would argue that they're not getting their gamblers because they don't really understand what they own why they own it they just heard it was a good company or their study says it was a good company but\nThey don't really have a plan of what happens when I'm wrong and we're going to always be wrong because these things all change you know we think about ten years ago the greatest company out there to buy for the long term was was blackberries called ... back in the day\nHe was trained for a hundred and forty dollars a share it was the dominant cell phone company you can be president you didn't have a blackberry you couldn't be secretary of state unless you had Thirteen blackberries I mean just for convenience but be that as it may\nThe problem was is that apple came along with a new phone and an Android came along and all of a sudden this dominance company got crushed this long term can't lose proposition lost in that stock one from a hundred and forty bucks a share right now I think is trading around ten or eleven and it's not going to come back\nAnd this is the other thing and I'll go through this with you guys in class when stocks fall they almost never come back you know people talk about why by these you know good dividend paying stocks okay in a blue chips okay well Ford is is still down Seventy five percent\nGee is down eighty percent and it keeps tanking many of the large banks are still down eighty and Ninety percent and they're not going to come back\nThat's the side of this that people never see and that's what I Will show you in class and how show you how to make money on it as well\nSo again the classroom and to be teaching as before the crash will talk about strategies for the market going up market going down how do we actually profit on these moves down you can get to free tickets and a free tablet when you come out plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T. R. A. D. E. R. that's eight for for eight eight\nGood morning I'm is a southern live oh God I never green tree\nIt is an evergreen tree here in our climate it will shed a substantial portion of is leaves usually at about late February or march with a new growth comes out and at that point to the little drop you know anywhere from Fifteen eighty percent of its leaves and then leave back out\nOkay 'cause I I Need to point a tree by water feature oh I was also thinking of a fantastic shore that push could start to start show\nOkay and and and those would be good choices as well um you know the difference between the actually the pistachio in the live oak is that the ashes pistachio going to drop all their leaves usually in January\nAnd the ... going to stay green until you know normally when the south starts to push in the spring and it'll push off its leaves as it's changing them in the spring and the first spraying him into the sap comes up at least come off\nBut there are all three pretty good trees by a by a fountain um you're going to have a little bit more with the acorns as the oak gets older dropping some acorns out a sequence with delays\n[laughter] okay well thank you very much and they get Greg and have a nice weekend you're by by by\nOh that means is wide open phones Carlos back here ... know Carlos this year and he does the music and he does the\nAnd he's just a generally all around really good guy so he but he's but he's not doing much right now so that means you need to call\nThe number to call six so two to six o five three nights or\nYou could talk to Carlos and then we could all discuss whatever it is you want to grow water plant fertilizer kill certainly lots of things in the real world of all powers and you know Bob used to tell me when it first started on the radio he said\nYou don't try and you can just talk about ... feet all day he says there's enough you know to cover it with a bogus be a plant that gosh you know some people love um some people hate and the clean their dirty they're\nBeautiful blue better here they place on the planet\nYou know there's all different kinds of varieties you know whatever it is but we would like to really the kind of gear the conversation\nTo what you're interested in vegetable gardens are a great thing for\nThis time of year we could talk about mending and preparing our soil flowers or you know perfect time to start talking about flower beds because as soon as that temperature drops in the next couple of weeks perfect time to plan your geraniums petunias bans snap stocks you know we really are in a place where we enjoy almost spring like whether you know for the next\nBeliefs six weeks you know this is really the perfect time of year to get out and plant and then the things that got beat up for the summer and fertilizing are hardly ever ... you know things like citrus if you haven't\nFound them all year and if you're citrus little burnt a little tired now is the perfect time to feed them is is when they rip it roared this is when they're they're happiest\nWith this kind of whether a hundred degrees in Seventy citrus are just going to grow like crazy so perfect time to get after those guys and give them fed as well are still two lines open the number to call six so two to six o five three nine for Jim in Peoria good morning a gym\nAnd doing great sir cool\nWay to treat the trees on the other side of my friends the problem is I guess about twenty feet from there and I'm afraid they're going to grow up in his trash or\nYou know you're very lucky Jim of all the trees they could have planted twenty feet from your fans pistachios are the best really\nYeah the reason why is they drop their leaves one week here in January and the rest of the year they shed nothing so what they're going to do is they're gonna shade your yard you know in the summertime which side of the house they on\nTheir on the east side\nOkay so you know you're going to get your pool's going to be a little cooler because they're they're in the summertime but in the winter time when you want the sudden they're going to drop so they're going to drop their leaves mid January you they're going to all fall at one time he might have to clean if you and your back yard there for a week or so\nOther than that they're going to they have no litter so your your privacy or prayer pool you're going to get nice shade and in the middle of the winter time when it's cool and you want the sunshine the sun's gonna come back\nI Love your attitude man\nYou're off well Jim I get all I can say is you're walking on water we're not going to play that song today but you know if there was any one tree they could have pointed out behind you that's the very best one\nIf you get a chance to Philly for me up with and what Bill so my my my cousin bill you're going to get\nMy cousin bill is a wonderful cousin went to Central High school I Will definitely a gym in ... you can't give his last name but I'll just tell them the Jim from ... gave them a call\n... Jim from school number one grew up with him and went to central isn't it great\nYeah he was he's a good cousin okay make Jim hey Jim yep\nYou might want to look him up and give him a call right now he has a daughter were kind of praying for my my cousin Cheryl\nAnd be a good time to cars All right thank you ah let's see Susan ... good morning Susan\nI'm running I have no question our last year I wrapped my pomegranate ... paper bag to keep the ... tried to read\nIt will it you know they just didn't in time what happened Susan we didn't have any frost\nYou know we went all the way through January with no cold weather you know and for a pomegranate to get the best quality what they count on is usually in November the mornings getting cooler\nYou know we have to have some temperatures down around forty for him to really turn so the bats are wrapping 'em saved him from the ... but their quality was kind of limited because of the ah not lack of cold weather\nOK\nOkay that makes it All right yeah ... ... feet right now probably vegetable garden\nWell you can you hear all the winter stuff so I mean you can pretty much you could go out and plan if you want to put onions or if you want to plant um you know any of the garlic in the ground that's a good thing to grow and you got to plant most us from scratch but\nBen aside from that you can start planting seeds all the green vegetables so broccoli cabbage cauliflower kale lettuce you know all those green things would be fine and you could actually grow up carrots and radishes from seed right now to\nUm get breakfast shops girl came here they do okay yeah they'll do fine and then this would be a good time to plant them\nNot because of the right\nYeah you could planet from cedar from ... you know it's just so hot that we really can't bring the sets in because we don't sell the volume for people to plant them commercially they're all planted from set so\nHow they would be done Susan at home if you wanted to\nKind of mimic that would be grow the seeds like it as the tray and you could buy these little ... pot so little thumb pot that rise when you put water in them and plant your seeds in those get up at his tablet should you're only talking about growing them in the little pots for about two weeks and then planning them into the garden gives you an easier start that happened to try and maintain\nMake the cut where now than they ever that ground\nYeah but they're going to come out at night and feed on your plans so they they they they they don't eat dirt plants and and they're going to come out at night and feed on your plants and a lot a lot of ... caterpillars do that I mean it's\nThat's why I say the early bird gets the worm but all these worms that live in the soil come out at night and see it on the plant so we want to try and kill 'em so when they're going to come out and feed on your foliage you want to spray\nThem okay now where I didn't know that cut worms or eight the foliage I just thought they ate the route\nWelders grubs it eat the roots so if you want to treat the rubs the bacillus isn't gonna work for you at all\n[noise] okay I guess for grabs than\nWell grubs are pretty hard for anything that I Know of that's going to be organic and or maybe somebody else has got a different idea you know were researching and doing more and more organic stuff ourselves all the time\nBut for getting things with grubs that are down in the soil I don't know of any really good organic controls for them\nUm everything that I can think of when we put it through as kind of like a soil drenched and we were drenched them and kill 'em there's a lot of things that we can use that way um you know really probably some of the best are going to be some of the things that contains nicotine always unfortunately that would work pretty well like um\nThat's gonna be the bearer systemic insecticides and those are going to go through the systemic and then you really have to be careful when you're using those they use the right dosage and the ones that are used for plants that are going to produce food they are no license for that they're used for that but you have to be careful with them\nAbout that a male and I'm a sales ...\nIt was just ... sides are going to work just for you know they work for snails and and so the fact of just about as easy with those guys you can get them with a plate of beer but you know if we have drugs that are in the soil feeding on the roots we have to get a chemical down into the soil\nThat's why the things like the barest systemic insecticides work well because when they feed on the roots and makes the ... toxic to the ... and that way it goes into the soil and very effective but ah and then there are ones that are set for different kinds of fruiting plants and you could use a lot of reading plants we want to be careful if we're using any of those products\nNot to use the my blooming plants because there's concern with him and the bees but um so it's kinda tricky\nOkay well good luck with I Wish I had a better solution but may maybe what she needs a hobby just defense him in the garden there for a couple of months later rude all those grubs out and then replant\nOkay\nBy by a ... good morning Maggie getting money you know what I Need he needs an armadillo Maggie an armadillo\nWould get those scrubs how're you\nDoing fine thank you great I have a bottom brash tree and a brilliant plum tree ... and now look like they're dying but the bottom of breast cancer for two years\nOkay how much do you feed it on how big it twenty minutes three times a week of water yeah\nOkay so when you're watering twenty minutes that with a ... with a drip system\nIn that case so that's probably giving it a quarter water three times a week and you live on a quarter water three times a week\nI think no [laughter]\nI don't think you probably don't think your plants can either Maggie you know what you how long have your plants been installed\nThey planted for about four years\nOkay so what you need to do is you need to change ... system you need to go out and take your little and bitter and put it into a capture device like a court jar see how much water actually putting on any given period of time but you want to give those plants you know thirty or forty gallons of water about once a week in the summertime once every two weeks in the winter\nOkay for them\nYeah and then so what what's happened is there just you know drying up hydrated\nOh well they're dried up more water\nThey need more water and they don't need it three times a week they need to get the soil wet and let it dry out\nSo what you need to just go out and see how much water your systems putting out put the water down deep enough to where it's going to you know saturated large area so that their roots can grow and spread\nAnd that way they'll be more drought tolerant so you'll use less water or for the plant and it's you know his whole health but you want to water 'em deep and let them try out and so you really need to go out and check your irrigation system and make sure they're getting a good deep irrigation and and then let them dry in between\nOkay thank you hit I think the thing\nYeah be a great time to feed them you know whatever you have a home would be fined you can feed them what Peter's or miracle grow or citrus food they don't really care the Twenty one selling fourteen launched with a light does you know these are little ... guys so it's you know it's there not wanting to huge goes the fertilizer right now until they get started again but a little fertilizer and water is going to go a long way from Maggie\nOkay great oh\nThank you thank you Bye bye have a nice weekend ah we're gonna take a short break while we're God I got three lines open Carlos violent give us a call six so two to six o five three nine for Brian and Carlos or what the what soldiers regarding show on five fifty KFYI or anywhere on the planet and I heart radio\nPat learn real we know that car wreck still take the weekends often neither do we if you put her in a car wreck or over the weekend you don't have to wait till Monday to get the help you mean [noise]\nTrailer for say Iran [noise] rooms ... [noise] no no food\nNo pets [noise] I got those ... are the\nTwo hours Bush in ... buys\nPay for\nMan means no means [noise] game\nTrain [noise]\nThan the nation thing or [noise]\nSued shoes [noise]\nI don't they know the union news ...\nTo dig down and down the\nMan of me in my\nHome the gang of\nStrain\nThat\nEvery town\n... no I'm\nSaying is Raj say\nIs\nWhat it would be bad if Iran if I'm not happy Saturday\nFolks welcome back to the\nNursery garden shall we got Carlos with all the fun songs and music and on the phone and guess what he has three lines open and give them a call number to call six so two to six o five three Ninety four and we can talk about whatever it is you want to grill water plant fertilizer kill\nYou know we don't have all the solutions we just have a few ideas and if you got solutions that ideas for us give us a call two and a you know we've got a pretty good collective audience here with a lot of experience than\nFun fun things to grow and wants to learn lots to do so give us a call six so two\nTo six o five three nine for and it's gorgeous Saturday morning out there that sunrise was really special in the clouds up there kind of nice looks like we're going to lose a for a few days after today so it's enjoy our Saturday a number to call again six o two to six o five three nights for uh any in Tucson good morning\nAny [noise] hey\nI'm the first time listener first time caller tell you have to feed our tickets for [noise]\nUm I I'm planning on getting a garden where if the race card and wanting to go by boat because I had so much as hell okay how do you find it good soil so that my plants will actually get a chance\nBrian I\nCan I can I ask you a question about about lawn\nGrass sure\nOkay you know Conrad to deal with a new show you can ask me a question about anything and I might tell you the truth and then my lie to you but also dealt definitely ... okay\nAll right hey I planted some mid iron back to the day it's about thirty five years old and a\nLot of course the only time it looks good it's I have to leave it fairly long\nMhm uh\nBut uh when I go for the winter lawn and I'll cut it down pretty short almost down to nothing but I still have a problem in the spring with with that\nIs that for ... have you ever have you ever ...\nI'd be ... or ... in the spring\nOkay we rented dispatching machine ... Iran's rented the statue and she was nice and cut it all up\nWhat's that\nYou rent my regular detaching machine did ... I\nRented I rented one regular okay machine and I but I still seems like I'm Still battling the the fact that I'm doing I was wondering what I'd be better off doing that\nBefore I Do the winner lawyer or my doing it right in the spring\nYou're doing it the the normal process Conrad said during the spring and if it's the same time you to read it and throw some ... good\nAnd uh I Do that by by cutting it all back and getting a down getting rid of that right grass early I you know it sounds like you've got a pretty good management practice going and especially if you had the same you know on for that many years so I think he got it pretty well pegged\nOkay so just continue what I'd do that shit out in the spring and\nThen there's nothing like success yeah and that and that's that's the norm I mean that's what people would normally recommend a you're leaving a little more energy for that grass by not detaching it in the fall and uh you know he probably are going to send it out a lot worse it sounds like you take pretty good care of your lawn you probably wouldn't hurt anything\nBut that is enormously de patch it before it starts to grow again\nYou don't normally normally when do you plan to ride grass Conrad\nOh usually I'm In October sometime\nYeah so you're planning to fairly late so I think you have a real good program going I wouldn't change it\nOkay yeah because out to eat that ... ... with the machine and then\nLater on I'm having to do it by hand and you know how much work that is\nWell at least you hadn't been or and you gotta thank goodness you don't have ... [laughter] oh really oh God yeah ... if\nWas you know you switch gears or no I think you have a pretty well nailed I mean\nThat that's where you're at\nNow so the next couple of the habit of 'em wanted to plant some sort of graft for the dog ... you know not not a very big or maybe three hundred square feet what would you recommend would be the best way to get started I mean it's all just natural decompose granite and rock\nYeah I I Would just pick out an area put a border around it and uh you know with that kind of clay soil is going to hold water pretty well just take the rocks out and just and saw a tiff way for Nineteen side\nSafeway for Nineteen what they have like on cardinal stadium and uh you know it takes a lot of traffic so it's great for dogs and uh just sprinkled ... regularly out there all do fantastic and that would be probably the best lawn for dogs\nAre wonderful they could start my thanks to him by by by by ah Richard Mesa good morning Richard\nYeah Mardi Gras I got a question for you I I own a ... a parking lot of ... and the uh parking lot as an island and that it's\nBasically inside the Iowa and it's got to built up areas that I did with those papers you know that you stacked on top of another uh-huh ... and they used to plant or areas are about a ten feet in diameter to up okay have irrigation that on each corner of the silent or\nA or there's one on each corner evergreen trees that started five gallon there now by twenty eight they provide a lot of shade for pickup um I've never been able to grow anything in these plant or because of the shape um any suggestions\nOr you are you looking for his rub type thing Richard what are you looking for in the play well I\nTried to Canada because I thought well that would be ... ... ... and but it was just too much shaped their uh or when people pick up their kids from the are going there parked around this island told ... looking for something that I Am very ... and there are\nWell for minimal for minimal maintenance and ease what you might look at his box with beauty NATO plum\nAnd medical card box with beauty NATO plum and beauty\nYou be able to nail ... right\nAnd the box with beauty needle plumbers ... going to be dark green it might have a few white flowers here and there but it will thrive in that shady your condition and he very easy to maintain and grow\nSo that was spread out across the planet\nOr they'll they'll spread and you'd you'd plant I'm probably about two foot apart and just let them grow into these green blobs that will kind of just build a plant or\nNow if you wanted something you know there's a lot of other things you could use that uh\nThere's the spaghetti strap a ... which really aren't real spy any on the end so you could have 'em around kids and you could use those but I Would think the box with duty would probably be the easiest it'll it'll thrive and do well\nOr it's not going to grow and cascade over the planners if you wanted something to grow fast in cascade over the planners I Would plant would do ya it's also called yellow dots and would do use ...\nYellow dodge yeah this call yellow dots easier it's shiny bright green has a little yellow flower though it won't blue much there in the shade\nOkay it won't gloom and the shape go\nNo means not going to ... you get a little slower and I put on a lot and the other one into the hearts and flowers otherwise\nIt's just a ... ... and the odd Harry easy a box of beauty\nOkay if you have those at your nursery sure I'd recommend something else I'm\nSorry I said of course I Do or I Would recommend another plant\nOkay which which they throw it up the players or can I Am so parts of LA so I mean I ate for that\nOr they are they ten by ten or their squares or\nThe other kind of a hat circles basically can buy ten ... yeah you're going to need seven for each one seven to nine\nEleven tonight okay which which do you keep those that\nWell we should have them and all the stores and in fact I've got some really nice new ones coming in from the forum this week so if you would come in ah next you know late late this week like Thursday or friday this week while I have a lot of new ones and that will be really nice I think we're kind of low on them right now but I've got I'm getting loaded up the first two weeks in the form they'll be there by the end of the week\nUh and as I got some guys coming to put sawed it on our put the riot on Saturday I got five thousand feet of Broderick let's go on and so a sheet the arch up I come by like first year or something like that you're not one of your store\nYeah will happen all the stories ha\nWhich door was I might shape overt it's okay if you want and\nWe also share the fifty one the easiest ones one eighth street in Glendale avenue\nOkay thank you thank you Richard but by\nAh Jerry over ... good morning Jerry\nI Hope I get this straight Brian I wanted to thank you for the two year old if certificate which I think yesterday I going to plant a few tomatoes and like Fifteen gallon containers I Can't go on the ground anymore\nAnd I got my own six months and one chicken manure and the lady I don't think I made it straight to her [noise] told me they just use a half a handful of chicken manure or an H Fifteen gallon can paint or which I'm going to mix with after\nYou mix it up in the soil Jerry yes okay I I Would use at least a full measuring cups all and it's all young container well I uh that's not going to her to the fact you could if you're going to mix it with the dirt you could use a probably two or three cups full of a chicken ...\nI'm going to kill it together yeah if you're going to blended together use two or three cups per per container\nI thought that sounded like and I didn't want to ask you first\nWell it's always easier to err on the side of light and putting too much on but if you're going to blend that then that would be fine\nYeah well and that's all I Need it and thank you much\nChange Jerry by by\nA filling queen creek good morning Phil\nHi I'm ... weeks ago you talked about letting Bermuda grass one with a lot of we'd go dormant mhm\n'cause I had been planning rye every year and that was John very muted couldn't overtake the weeds is here\nAnd say so what you want to do use it pre emerging\nIron nursery and I bought them Brian than me uh-huh and they told me a bag of a concern and a bag of lead Dieter complete\nMhm and I want to know when to turn my water off and when to apply those two product\nWell you'd want to apply the products you know probably within the next week or so\nBecause what you want to do is you want to stop all the winner weeds for coming up now hasn't been our temperature hasn't changed enough for me to go yet but you want to do it sooner rather than later and you don't want to turn the water off you want to keep the water on and keep to Bermuda grass growing as healthy as you can through November\nYou know when it will actively grow\nSo you want you want in fact it wouldn't even be a bad time to fertilize right now because it's going to grow really well to the end of October for sure and maybe in the November and even longer because we've had such mild winters\n[noise] okay so I'll leave it all the water on and apply the leader complete with a week right and then what about this a concern\nKnow I'm kind of look at those because I don't know ... with chemicals I'm usually on the farms and so I Need to kind of find out what they are a little bit more but if you want to hold on the line and uh then\nWhy I fly who else wants to discover how to invest\nIn [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThen I saw her saying\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] oh then saw his\n\n\n\n... [noise]\nGive us a call Lindsay it'd be blamed the grim when he's got a big ... back there and he's chopping\nThe wires heart so a number to call sick so two to six o five three and four and I apologize for those you got dropped a\nBut I give us a call fix so two to six o five three nine for let's see if our phone lines are working and we could talk about whatever it is you want to grow water plant fertilizer kill where you're at a beautiful time of year to do planting you know this is what our weather changes and now that we have a separation and temperatures I Know it's going to be a hundred ... could be a hundred and for the next month\nBut the cooler temperatures in the morning and make a huge difference on how plants perform you don't have at our citrus groves all of a sudden now we have big slush is a new growth and you should have the growth of most of your citrus and things at home as well so if you haven't\nFertilized now is the perfect time to fertilize all your hearty evergreens that goes for citrus but also for ... bike histories and high discuss pretty much all those hardy evergreens now the chance for them to go wow you know the\nMornings or cruel or we can grow will enjoy the beautiful sun rises days or a little shorter we don't get so hot for so long and flash really thrive and do a lot better\nThree lines still open sorry about if we dropped you but Carlos I think's got her fixed the number to call six so two to six o five three nine for Diane in Phoenix good morning\nIn mourning grand yeah we got lot somehow\nYeah I Know the ... sneak into the studio sometimes but Carlos ... he got um ...\nOkay I have a lot that's been in the ground or I don't know for years you know what to do the ATF free one\nUh-huh older one okay I like it I mean at least they're getting ...\nDiana how do you water it\nMaybe once a week okay with the host or without yeah Jay Leno\nAnd and that should be fine this time of year it should be coming back out and started ... you know really put out new growth with are changing weather have you ever fertilized it at all\nNo I ... well if I haven't spent a long time\nYeah and while giving a light do support allies are watered heavy once a week and you should\nGet some new growth is really not any inherent problems that usually effect desert willows and this is typically a good growing she's now I'm not
