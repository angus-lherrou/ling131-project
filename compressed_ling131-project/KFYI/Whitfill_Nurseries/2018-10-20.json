{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "A hundred and Seventy five not close\nBut what's amazing about it is almost all equity in houses now part of what's driving the equity in houses is\n... ... real estate mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again a big key and the top when you have this much margin debt what happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nSo you borrow the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing capacity\nSo you don't actually have to solve the stocks so all this money gets created and that creates demand\nNow at the same time companies are buying back thrown stock which is limiting supply so this pushes stock prices up and you have this ... this virtuous cycle as people get more borrowing capacity that borrow more money they don't have anything else to do with the money 'cause nothing else was given a decent rate of return so they keep buying more and more stocks\nBut what always happens in these cycles is it that when the fed stress raising interest rates then all of a sudden the margin that doesn't become as attractive as it used to be actually so I think today that if you're borrowing less than about fifty granted Schwab on margin right now it's costing you nine to ten percent\nOkay that's a big number and all of a sudden that isn't as attractive as stocks aren't going up so fast you combine that with again you know a big change in the house in ... this fall and all of a sudden social mood starts changing\nPeople aren't as optimistic there's not as much confidence it's two years of what you've just been through on the Kavanaugh hearings only is going to feature Mr Trump and everybody he knows\nAgain you may think that's what should happen and that's all fine you're into that opinion and I'm not here to argue it one way or the other but\nI'm going to tell you is going to have a tremendous impact on the stock market because all of this revolves around confidence and it will be crushing the confidence and the fact that may be a strategic move by the people on the other side\nBecause if the economy's not doing well it's going to be a whole lot harder for the Republicans to win and twenty twenty but that's kind of the big view on all of this\nThe smaller view is that you've got very little cash left on the sidelines is getting more expensive for people to borrow money to buy stocks and when that\nHappens people stop borrowing so much that takes away demand when you take away demand that when companies have to borrow at pay more to borrow money to buy back their own stock\nWhen mortgages go up and now housing prices have to come down to reflect the increase in mortgage rates all of a sudden the economy starts turning and it turns very quickly and again in two thousand and eight when the market crashed at last forty percent of its value in a month\nIt was Thirteen Years of gains in Eighteen months\nThat is very likely in my opinion something on that magnitude is inevitable I can tell you when it's going to start but I can tell you you're seeing a lot of signs of the top right now now companies may continue to buy back their stock next year because they haven't spent all the repatriated money\nBut earnings are starting to get weaker this quarter GDP forecaster being lowered around the world\nYes you've gotten through the NAFTA deal but you still have a lot of issues with China Italy as a basket case and they're going to have big problems with the ... you and you may end up with another group wanting to Italy may want to leave the EU sometime this year\nAll of these things can take this market down very quickly and getting back to the first idea people always tell me that their investors and I would argue that they're not getting their gamblers because they don't really understand what they own why they own it they just heard it was a good company or their study says it was a good company but\nThey don't really have a plan of what happens when I'm wrong\nAnd we're going to always be wrong because these things all change you know we think about ten years ago the greatest company out there to buy for the long term was was blackberries called ... back in the day he was trained for a hundred and forty dollars a share it was the dominant cell phone company you can be president\nHi I'm Brian I'm about six months ago I purchased two beautiful Korean shout Bush's from when I hear over there and Gilbert uh-huh\nI'm doing ... I mean they're just great my everything out they have on the ground ground plant\nEverything has its guide\nWhile you win native ... and it grew what the heck you should he should marry a Native American\n[laughter] I and I was looking at some stuff and Korea so and they really care off everything out\nWell not when they're young rose when when the plants mature out in the desert nature\nYou know they basically have almost like a natural pre emergent were plants don't grow right underneath them but if you hike around the desert there's plenty of other plants going was Korea so those Korea so he didn't have any effect at all on your other plants yeah sure and it didn't ... Texas say they are not that mean God oh my gosh\nOkay well I Would\nSay it's probably didn't get quite enough water but you know this is a good time you can plant another we're not out roads we have plenty of tech\nGot plenty of water [laughter] okay I Know so that's why I I just thought oh my gosh what is going on okay well then I'll Try it again on a couple of things to say\nThanks rows have a nice weekend okay thank you Bye bye ah Chris in Phoenix good morning Chris\nGood morning just a real quick question I wanted to plant some flowers rubble and it it is a good plan them now or should I wait\nWell you know you can plant bulbs here Chris but we really don't use as many bulbs here as they do in other places like iris into looks and that's the kind of thing and the main reason why is because we have such a wonderful season that last from now till may but you can plant something like get uranium but petunias era you know all different kinds of stocks all these beautiful flowers\nThat will flower for up to six or eight months and the thing with two birds and then like especially to us or a great example they only have a two week bloom cycle\nSo you do all this work for a two week party instead of having color all winter\nOh I I don't expect them to live\nOkay well you know what I Am virus in my own yard that come back every year in bloom so there there are races and different things that will do that so if you want to plant them you know now it's time to plan if you have bulbs you know they should come in dormant and be fined or go ahead and plant right now\nOkay because I I didn't expect them to live through the summer because I Would think that the heat would just take them\nWell some of the viruses and different things do live in the summer they would they will come back oh I didn't know that okay thank you Chris plant them now I was I had him now but by a gym up in carefree good morning Jim\nMartin Yes sir um\nIs it too late to in the season to a fertilizer trees and shrubs\nUh it depends on what the what kind of trees and shrubs your fertilizing centuries is rubs you know actually grow fairly well through the winter months the hardy evergreen things so like a ... you know would probably benefit from it you if you haven't fertilize citrus it all you could still do that um but most of our growing season for most plants is over hearty I mean\nLet me I mean okay like Cape honey suck\nYellow bells are a\nVery to assure you know we'll give you idiots probably lovely\nWell for the whole class I mean all all those plants really don't require much fertilizer any way aren't gonna benefit for many really right now because they're growing season is coming to a close though they may still girl it'll end blue more through the winter especially the ... via I Would wait and fertilize all those varieties probably the fifteenth of February\nOkay but like actors like wooden barrels\nYou know it's not going to be of any benefit to him right now by the time that uh they're going to start using the the fertilizer might have reached out already so I Would just hold off the fertilizer program till spring\nYou saved me some work and saved me some money\nWell it'd be thankful for the fact that we had all this rain the least are salts out your plants are going to probably be just real happy anyway even without the fertilizer this\nTime I realized prior to that rain so well that's that's perfect okay thanks very up thank you Jim by by\nOh let's see next step we have but north Scottsdale good born and bud\nGood morning surrogate to questions or you want to live in North Scottsdale up at about twenty four hundred feet and at what temperature do I need to start covering my moving via you\nKnow ... years will actually take temperatures down in the teens before they die but\nAs far as being burnt they can be burned in the mid twenties um so you know anytime are predicting a temperature that it's going to be below freezing you might want to cover of vogue and be a uh the reality is with bogus via though and being up higher in elevation if you're on a hillside more altitude does not mean you're colder\nYou do in the ... general geographic area of the low points in the area are going to be the whole point so if you have a house on a hillside there's a real being next to you\nIt can be ten degrees colder and they're being the ... so what you really want to do but as you really want to check your temperatures\nYou know with the airport or your favorite on line you know temperatures service and find out where you're going to actually why now it's probably the easiest to check with one new news service all the time because there are several different news services they give us temperatures from different areas and it varies a lot regionally so get out and check your own temperature but\nYou know truthful if you don't want any cross burning all covering bullet when it's below freezing you know if you're worried about the plant dying I'm into plants begin established you know it'll take down into the high teens\nOh okay that sounds great the quick question is I have Bermuda and some grass during the summer right in the winter how do I get rid of perch\nMove no actually the easiest way to get rid of the ... just to um not to kill the ride grass or early ... said to shut the water off in the rye and kill it you know in April which is really hard to do because the grass is beautiful in April right if you're married it's going to be even harder to do\nBecause it's a hard story to sell right for the health of your Bermuda grass or the earlier get rid of ride the better they burned the grass is going to do what do you have solid cover over the ground and you don't have any sunlight hitting the soil happens here in the summertime when the rye dies out you really want have near the German nation\nAnd the other thing that you can do is you can put down a pre emergent\nAnd put that down in like late April early may and that'll keep this bird from regenerating you know this the right grass in itself is going to act as a pretty good pre emerging because no lights going to hit the soil\nUntil may or June but if you put a pre emerging down like April or early may that's going to keep that bird seed from generating as well\nOkay thank you so much based Bye bye bye I\nTake a short break well my God we had the wonderful Carlos back\nHere on phones yet and use it against violent with his beard and just enjoying this beautiful day\nAnd we have three lines up and not like the beginning of the showing get right to you give us a call at six so two to six o five three night for this is Brian and Carlos here with a with Phil nursery garden show on five fifty KFYI or anywhere in the plant and then I heart radio home\n\n[noise]\nWe\nJoe this\n\nHave you had\nMe Saturday boasting welcome back to I have so little league glorious Saturday and uh what better weather to dance in the ... and we're having here in the desert right now we do have two lines open the number to call six though two\nAnd my question really good\nBut I have a tentative plan that printed and he could take pot but if I buy the paper that site one but at at at three week has really gone they have ... like a\nLittle tiny tomato and I have four hour so I Know it's still good\nBut if it if you look healthy\nYou know surely a main needs to more nitrogen\nSo you might want to go ahead and fertilize it and uh the faster working fertilizers this time of year the water soluble variety\nUm it made you want to kind of push it out right now why it's still warm this temperature we have is a great temperature for setting tomatoes we're we have nighttime temperatures below sixty five and you really want to encourage it to grow you know one product that we use a lot when we're growing tomatoes in the spring we've had a lot of luck with the super bowl\nAnd super bloom so high phosphorus water soluble fertilizer that works very well on tomatoes\nBy that the that I have a ... grow\nMiracle worked fine it's not quite as good for tomatoes as super bloom but go ahead and use you have another look OK\nShare it with the water or\nYou can mix it with a water or you can spray it on the full of you to work faster if you spray it on but you then you can train some down in the soil as well\nOkay that make it hey like question they asked to sign on in the morning and tell the truth clock and they get shape not getting ... than\nThe sun the better this time of year but sun in the morning till two should be OK\nOkay and then add up the watering the watering my ... Jeffery white three cats awake at about forty five minutes\nWell surely that's going to be dependent on the soil to you planted in\nBut when you water it you want to have enough water to it leeches through the pot and little bit of water comes out the bottom of the pot\nOkay so it gets a full dredging and then just put your finger in the soil and check it and when it's dry it's time to water again you know when it's been warmer three times a week probably okay but that depends totally on the soil they use and you really have to check that yourself\nBut I think I can then after a sweater by and\nYou know hand watering surely is always the best you know you've got the time in the energy and want to be on and really enjoy your plants in your garden there's irrigation system to can see what your eyes and you get the ...\nThat's ... ... I think\nYou have a nice weekend but I don't really take a short break because we afterwards commercial and Carlos his back your spiraling he's an accomplished a great music force coming out of the break in the meantime we have two lines open the number to call six so two to six o five three Ninety four to six so careful I\nThis is Brian and Carlos you're what the what soldiers regarding show on five fifty KFYI or anywhere on the planet in our heart radio\nI'm In\nYouthful Saturday morning we got one line still open the number to call six so two to six o five three night for the next we have a mandate in Cape creek good morning Amanda\nCommitting or anything and I have a question about when a several slightly sloping hill sites\nThat church semi desert they had latest plan okay and\nI Need to put in a lot of colored\nOr the next season and lever I whenever I Am the only thing I can think of the land that there must be more [noise] so what is colorful we treat and what would actually make it at three in the truth here the winter\nWell that the easiest thing as you suggested this land here you know it's hard to be land for color unless we have a hard freeze it will stay in bloom almost all winter uh a couple others do Angelina daisies\nAngel lead oh a yellowish one\nWell as a yellow one in a black there's there's desert marigolds and Angelina daisies and those two were native types of plants that will stay perennial there and they will not perform like when do you mean nothing's going to perform like land piano and this time of year if you want to lend Hannah that's going to bloom best in the wintertime you might look at the purple some whites\nAre there ... there are a little different type of ... it's spreading land ... lower and they blew better in the winter than the yellows and some of the varieties too but\nIt could you repeat the name of the one that create\nWell it just you just look for the purple and white trailing\nPurple and white it's easier to create more and it's they they treat her and you cut back they they return it not\nThat it's pretty amazing I end up we had to freeze in El Paso where we're at and it was a free below zero stay below freezing for Seventy two hours and ... came back so antennas are are pretty frost proof as far as the whole plant dying but they will bring back to the ground in hard freeze\nOkay and the one with the mother creepy creepy thing or a very green plan that would last a long when it gets cold\nWell ... is one that you want more tropical but what is it green and spreads a lot faster you know in that one would stay green and then there are some ... varieties is creeping occasion or red lens no it's going to get two or three feet tall\nAnd another one of my favorites that can die out and comes back in cycles but it's really pretty it's Mexican ...\nOkay a mixture of us has a beautiful pink star Oh thank you very much\nThanks man if I buy a gym in North Korea good morning Kim\nHow are you I'm great how are you\nWonderful well it's debatable but I my having a good time anyway\nI asked you questions they asked the question is I have been on orange\nAnd they they need to grapple eleven years of all that great but right now I'm getting brown on the top of them for about three inches\nYou're having a caterpillar party\nYeah we have little bag were have been eating\nAnd well mother nature's gonna stop to party right now because of the change in weather\nAnd we've had a problem the last three years on those and bogus idea which we never had prior and they're out feeding on the new gross so what you want to do is you want it you can print them back a little bit right now cut away the damage and the probably that whole season is over with now with the cooler weather and it's not going to be a problem any more until next year in August\nBut next August what you'd probably want to do with you on the spraying with ... or B te okay and it's easy for you to spray it's not going to hurt you but it's toxic is called the worms\nAnd will stop them from feeding on them next next year so that wouldn't be too concerned right now at printing back and clean 'em up and then I was praying with the tea you know afterwards and the next year in August like the first of August and you shouldn't have that problem again\nNext fall I Can't say I thought the market actually okay and I want the game and showing in January ... I'm like how they shape and it really hit them\nOff well you know it's really hard to beat uranium here in the wintertime we grow more beautiful geraniums here than anywhere on the planet and I am prejudice I Am a native ... and for a couple of generations but you know really if you plant geraniums here mix similar billions and things and with them\nAnd if you want your whole neighborhood to smell nicer when some stocks and stocks are taller flour comes in you know ... whites ... but\nYeah I can think it'd be really neutralize it and you can definitely do it you know using the structure gas it but once again you really have to be careful\nAnd that's not going to hurt the roots of any of her plants you\nKnow it's amazing you know you can take a gallon of self your gas it and you can court around the trunk of a tree not up against on the bark but around the trunk of the tree in the soil and acid neutralizes the salt it won't hurt the roots at all so it takes quite a lot of assets neutralized now what I Would do is go out and get a P.\nS. B. I. P. H. test get and trying to get to the point you know where you you get back to hopefully close to seven on your P. H.\nOkay now my next question if those richer about what is the proper procedure when you have a neighbor's roots\nWell into the ... the best way is just to cut the Rudolph where it comes under the\nFence you know so just dig a trench by the fence and\nCut those roots off and then we're wherever the roots come up in the plants are actively growing let them get some size to um three or four feet tall and spraying with a little lie phosphate and that's it you know contact herbicide that goes right down through the plant and kills him\nIf I'd 'cause I've I've had a lot of people tell me they did not like this is a treat because of the root problems\nWell sisters you know there are a love hate tree and the story on the ... when you have a board child India plan assume by the time was old enough to get married it cuts down to build a house and you know it was funny the very serious issues I saw planted here rough seventh avenue and damned urine\nPlanted right up against the sidewalk and they didn't do very well but we've certainly with the Indian rose ... trees you know have a love hate relationship today\nAre not many trees grow faster as large you know and more than they are an areas words flood irrigated they get deep water don't have any surface water you don't have that problem with surface roots but if you have them by a lawyer ... records or drip system is running all the time\nAnd you have a lot of surface water you get surface roots\nRight I I Do have three in my backyard and they are in a ah they're all in wells and they get deep water yeah and I don't have I don't have any problems with\nA known if you can keep the surface water away from you know and a lot of ... dug it also reflects how we incorrectly water our yard with drip systems I mean a drip systems a great way to irrigate things but it's not set up to run everyday brand new landscaping one is installed by a landscaper just about anyone you read it every day for the first few weeks\nAnd then you're back off the frequency and back off the frequency of most of our established landscapes here if their water once deep every two weeks in the summer they thrive\nAnd then you don't have the surface of your problems\nWell good luck appreciate your help by uh unfortunately I think she's in for a little bit of trouble but I Will\nLove you're in the project is down south that sounds like she has a good friend Doug but you know to be careful with the acid but it will work\nOkay very good thank you sir and uh I I told her to get rid of her landscaper\n[laughter] well you know leave Bryan we we don't want to shoot him or anything dug but we do want to educate\nThem about K C yeah All right thank you very much you have a great day you too Bye bye\nGo oh let's say he was probably going to say do cats and we could use a little bit more go this week anywhere and take a short break we'll be right back with which one is regarding show here on five fifty KFYI any one of the planet and I are radio oh\n\n\n\nNot wake sunshine\nSaying is\n\nWell happy Saturday move to lead\nDue to for morning doesn't get any prettier\nWelcome back to which this regard surely want to take it made it invites you to what fills you know what feels be grow trees started by my grandfather back in Nineteen forty six and now for four generations if you need trees any kind any size coming

anywhere in the planted in my heart radio\n\n\nYou talk station is used dogs five fifty KFYI Phoenix Jay y o da de do Phoenix and I are the radio station\nAnd puts magnesium or apps and sell them the soil and just a basic fertilizer it's not going to hurt anything and you're going to have it built up for when they start to grow in spring or you could just wait till February and fertilize\nMhm and\nWater and I'm sure shouldn't be done now well let me see water now but not as much a Frank if there is ... been in for a year or two or more probably this time of your watering once every two weeks is plenty\n[laughter] that thing right and um that that's my question\nThere I have a nice weekend Frank thanks for the call me by a brat and Glendale good morning Brad\n[noise] morning Brian I'm snapped dragons I everybody says they're so easy um what I can get them to live but it seems like it initially blues once they up off of their um my supposed to be dead hunting them or traveling um or what so they keep all of it\nYou know I really haven't grown to snap says much myself so we have a lot more knowledgeable staff at our Glendale avenue store\nOkay and uh you know and I'll tell you it gets kind of hard to call them like today because they're going to be really really busy if you'd want to stop by today that could certainly help you with it or if you don't want to stop by our call them during the week uh all the girls are far more knowledgeable on ... snaps than I Am\n[noise] okay one one other quick question I uh about a century last year I'm unclear and transpose the true a bigger pot ... it's doing great now know a good time to go ahead and put it in the ground\nIt's the perfect time there couldn't be better to plan of pine trees and right now in fact you know this is the time of year when we start to shift to harvest and move all of our big pine trees and anywhere from about right now but especially years because in a container right now is a great time to shift that you might even get one more can linger one more set a new growth before the winter\nAnd then they'll be rooting out all winter and ready to just to jump in the spring\nOkay and then um we're doing a a runner ensure where we're going to be doing a garden for you know ... and ... and the truth isn't flowers so we can change it out I just got some mushroom compost mix in with the soil would you recommend anything else\nThat depends on how you want to build it up you know kind of the easiest way and flower beds is these are fertilizer like a ... you know as you kind of iffy compost it pretty well get everything planet then like those odds ... fertilizers now at this time of year it'll last for months\nOK you can ... now against February and you're done for the whole year\nOh that's too easy awesome Brian thank you love your show\nThanks rat freezes called by by uh see next to Bob in Mesa good morning Bob\nBelow their Brian how are ya great\nGood good hey a worst snow birds and we're having issues with a couple of citrus trees returned yesterday a and we don't have any fruits on our grapefruit tree or naval orange tree and when we left in April there was plenty of flowers\nWell we had an odd year this year Bob with the warm weather that we had no freezing the wintertime so the the crop on our citrus trees is definitely less than normal or it may be that they got a underwater it a little bit in late may or June\nAnd that's when we have most the fruit drop especially on the naval oranges enables dropped Ninety nine percent of the fruit any way to get one percent after the blooms to set you have a decent crop here in the valley but um I I Would suggest that it's probably more weather related than anything and I'm as we say in agriculture there's always next year\nYou know cause for hope for a little bit more normal whether we're a little cooler in the winter and maybe a little better bloom cycle but the most important thing to do is look after your water cycle while you're gone and it needs to be how old the trees Bob\nOn the naval they've all been in the ground seven years and the group grapefruits only a year in the ground\nOkay so pretty young trees you're probably going to want to have them on a weekly watering cycle while you're gone\nAnd you want to have the drip irrigation or ... or however they set up to water to water deep enough to go to a doubts about four feet so for those young trees you want to water you know one time a week but real heavy while you're gone and you know for the brand new grapefruit that's not unusual for the naval I think it just probably more a case of the weather\nOkay All right well thank you\nThank you Bye bye bye And let's see next up we've got David may say good morning Dave\nHow are you sort of wonderful sir I have two questions\nI just bought a house out in a mate who where they're proving grounds were\nAnd this is very hard and I'm going to have your nursery come out and trees and which do I need to do anything to the soil you know before they come out here\nOr no you shouldn't have to ... they're going to dig holes what you might do is tell them that you want to add some gypsum though to the bottom of the holes\nNormally that area out there Dave that soil is just compacted from construction you know so that soil is usually not a real hard soil but with new construction that gets compacted more\nSo if you would just called the store and talk to answer your Gabe wherever you dealt with air and have them bring some gypsum and just tell them to bring a bag of chips them and add something to the bottom of each hole that's got to help your circulation better it's something that we don't always do when we're planting but it would be good in your area with new construction\nThat one other question ... actually a claim in my front yard and they could have I\nUh-huh\nAnd um it's got a three main ships that are about an inch in diameter but it's got a bunch of coming up from the bottom do I need to trim those you\nKnow you might if you want to set it up to you and raise the canopy on the tree what I Would just leave it for now until it goes dorm it'll go dormant December January and then send it back to the three main trunk maybe ... how Tulsa tree now\nAbout seven\nOkay so raise the canopy up about Eighteen inch\nNext year you know you're going to raise it up to about four or five feet and then the following year if you want it raised up tall enough to walk it or you could do that so it's kind of a three year process you don't want to take all that way because the tree is going to grow faster for has more foliage but go ahead and start to sitting process this winter and continue for the next couple of years and you'll end up with a beautiful specimen tree\nI should start in December and then\nStart when it goes dormant be really easy to see all the foliage will drop and so we always drops in printed up and said raise it up Eighteen Inches or so than those way down at that point\nGreat thank you very much for certainly appreciate\nThanks David by but I haven't actually find a way to take a short break well we're going we're three lines open liver Europe next and young down but after clubs give us a call six so two to six o five three nine for Brian and Carlos hear what the what soldiers regarding show on five fifty KFYI or anywhere in the planet in my heart radio [noise]\nOn the bad\nGuy and you can watch on TV shaving\nCracking down on his Diane Lane you\nKnow when\nWe do get\nA new\nJob [noise]\nAnd I do jog with\nAnd slowing down\nSoftened up in ... in\nHampshire\nYeah OK next question I have is we bought a palm tree last year two years ago I guess with the smaller ones that have this tree trunks that come out of it\nI Wonder if it was called Phoenix but I'm not positive about that and we put it into a a ceramic part and I was thinking about taking out of the park because it's gotten kind of big apart and everything else and putting it in the ground is that possible to do that\nYou had time it'll be very happy it's probably a Phoenix ... or a pygmy date palm if you transplanted and the ground it's going to be much happier route out and it's a very wonderful little tropical palm but does great here on the Dutch\nYeah what kind of watering does it need or what do we do when they're trying to do it I guess\nYou could do it whenever it's convenient for you the weather's kind of nice though if you're looking for a weekend project you could planet right now as far as watering in the ground when it first transplanted probably twice a week and then after it's been in for a couple of weeks once every week or two\nYou know how deep with your water\nWhere you want to water down to adaptive about two feet to the\nYeah 'cause you want to get down a little bit deeper than the roots are there not a real deep rooted palm and they're not as large a problem with some others maybe but\nUh you know you want to go deep irrigation deep enough to push the salts down away from the ...\nAnd anything special about the size or anything like twice as big as\nWell they always say it's better to dig attend our whole for a five dollar tree I'm so a bigger hole doesn't hurt anything um but you know if you've got really decent soil whole big enough to accommodate the ... maybe five or six inches on each side should be plenty adequate\nOkay we're good thank you very much appreciate you\nThink you have a nice weekend oh let's see next Kristin surprise good morning Chris\nHi um yeah I have a couple of questions on land it in my backyard and I just purchased about an olive trees a minute you have the hedge um does that sound like a reasonable thing to you that\nYou know I think all trees Chris can make a beautiful hedge\nOkay that that's what the guy I can tell them well my main question is uh getting ready to plant a tree that that got huge trench and I just had our oil and it turned out at the very alkaline and I'm Wondering if um if I Need to make drastic changes to that as far as like\nProbably not Chris welcome to the desert most all of our soldiers pretty awkward you\nKnow I've got you got to the age of eight are a little little ... I wouldn't be surprised at all well did you buy the ... trees or did you buy the standard size olive trees\nAnd I believe that a standardized okay that the guy told me they were going to get to that they should get pretty pretty like hedge\nOkay well anyway with the standard size all trees like if you're plenty of Wilson I which is a free will solve which is pretty common here um you could plant um anywhere from three feet or six feet apart or even further if you want to\nAnd just start to ... a little bit on the side you know I Would print them a little bit from the get go so it's a city and they get full and um you know it sounds like you've got a big you know you've already got the hundred dollar hole for the five dollar tree so what you want to do is probably add a little bit of organic material and there may be one third compost when you plant 'em\nAnd um they'll do fine and they do very well in our alkaline soil here an olive trees are very hearty and they make a nice screen\nAnd just whenever you plant I'm just you know kind of take a lot of how tall you wanted to be how large woman to be and plant the spacing accordingly and uh but you start just all moderate pruning right away that's going to increase their density in and help the branch structure be better to make more of a hedge\nOh that's great and actually what what you\nGet to that question as far as that the difference between the the tree guy told me I should go pretty tight like so it it does that include split spread so it's not that big but I bought nine or ten\nOlive trees and identity to my can you go to they're\nNot at all Chris you know and I kind of reminds me and we used to plant sour orange tree Hedges here you know this hour oranges historically back you know in the fifties were planted from a little better route ceiling that was a foot tall and they were oftentimes plan this closest eight to ten inches apart\nAnd it doesn't hurt to have the hedge plants closer together not going to make any difference you can't really plan from too close\nOkay Great Hey well thank you very much thanks dress by by by our take a short break and we're on\nWe do have two lines open the number to call six so two to six o five three nine for Brian and Carlos here with which donors regarding show on five fifty KFYI or anywhere in the planted in my heart radio food\nWe\n\nOwn being\n\nNa\nNa\n\n\nNa\n\nTo the beautiful Saturday and I'm\nJust a little song for some of the law\nBut see caffeine Scottsdale next work happy\nThat mining Brian how are you today ... great advice all around question um I have a garden at our school and this year we would like to do a theme garden and we were thinking about\nMaking a salad thick gestures to help children and learn about gardening that would be easy and could workforce between now in the end of the school year\nLaw the green stuff it's really easy and that's kind of we think of in a salad unfortunately might have to bring into tomatoes but uh you can try some tomatoes if you can find plants big enough for fruit on them already\nBut as a perfect time of year to plant all your lettuce spin age you know broccoli cabbage calls are kale all the green things that go into a sour they're grown right here in Arizona and supplied the nation this time of year\nTo all those would be really easy um you know it's all you can buy probably would start with that you get a little plants that are already you know started just be a lot easier to get them going but that they grow quite fast and uh it's it's a good time of year and easily by the end of the season ah\nYou know before the holidays you could have a nice salad like so you might have to bring some tomatoes and but um I if you can find some tomatoes big enough to start to have some fruit you got a chance right now what tomatoes to infer tomatoes when I Would look forward to putting your salad we we like sweet one hundreds of little cherries\nAnd no I made those are going to ripen sooner you get a better chance to make some tomato soup probably couldn't start them from seed now but from plant you should be okay\nWell that would be wonderful thank you for that advice second question if you don't mind from my husband when it is a good time to plant roses\nRoses anytime right now you know pretty much with roses containerize roses planted this time of year do fantastic and you can plant bear roots which will be available more like in January but from now through probably the first in March is the best time of the year to ...\nWonderful thank you for that advice had a wonderful wake additive\nName's Kathy by by it but I\nAh let's see next up we've got Christina ... good morning Christine\nMorning I have a naval orange tree and it's about forty or so when we buy I think they said it was on at some sort of a door Rick Scott I probably have trade trinkets tying it came to\nLike in the past three or four days later cursing up on that side and yelling and at the base tree\nTree grows like a bus down to the ground but I can have that that bark crack on this side where the guy\nIs bleeding any sap Christine\n[noise] I don't have anything out I Am wondering if the storms that when could've blown Korea now to make it cracked like that has come for activity I don't I don't know they go for it come out on the bark\nNo but if you're having that much problem with the tree of that age I Would go right after the Gulf or you know I I think the gophers are probably done some pretty severe damage usually when we see cracking and burning on the side of a tree it's because the sun's hitting the trunk\nAnd it's a full as gifts then because the trees stressed and the gophers been chomping its roots off you know loses out foliage than the sun can hit it and sun burn it so I Would first off I Would be very active and get rid of the Gulf\n[noise] well I did\nKill morning that I\nMean we we love you yes probably can be safe so here's what I Would do I I Would get rid of the golfer okay if if the woods exposed to the sun I Would go ahead and paint that would expose white with the tree trunk white hey if you're not bleeding any sap you probably don't have any top or are the most is problems", "show_name": "Whitfill Nurseries", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "20"}
