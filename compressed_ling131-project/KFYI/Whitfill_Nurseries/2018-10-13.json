{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "About there's GDP Growth of three or four percent however for every dollar of growth in the economy we're currently borrowing three to four dollars and have been for decades so how do we really have any growth and we don't all we're doing is taking future demand plug it into the present in efficiently by the way\nAnd using it to make things look much better than they actually are\nThe next thing is is like the unemployment rate and kind of what triggered this with me is last week they come out we have three point seven percent unemployment\nOkay well then how do you explain the fact that we have three hundred and twenty million people or whatever it is in the country these days and we have Ninety five million of them not even looking for work\nAnd it's not older people retiring the people that are not in the labor force of the people from twenty five to fifty four and that has tremendous long term ramifications so the problem with the bogus statistics and and the next point I was making his book\nThe reason they give you the bogus statistics is because if you knew the reality you'd have no faith in this economy\nAnd if you don't have faith you worry about your job you worry about your investments you're less likely to put money in the market you're less likely to invest in education so that you can get ahead in the future who are less likely to take on that because you know that your job is more into cure than you think\nAnd all of those kinds of things so everybody kind of benefits from you know the big lives that are told out here and again you know just on the GDP thing the country right now is sitting on Seventy one trillion dollars in debt\nA huge part of this is individuals' borrowing money to go to college to buy houses they can afford and to buy stocks and I haven't really gotten to this in the show but\nAbout three percent more than three percent of the entire US Economy has been borrowed so people can buy stock on what's called margin and the problem is is that when when that starts getting more expensive when interest rates go up people start getting what are called margin calls and they have to come up with more money\nAnd these people don't have any more money so when that starts happening they're forced to sell and and part of what I cover in classes I Will show you how much margin death or as I'll show you how much money these people don't have\nAn historically what always happens in these cycles as the fed starts raising interest rates people start backing off on their borrowing okay it affects mortgage mortgage rates go up and mortgage rates have gone from about three percent to five percent and the last year or two K. that's a huge increase\nWhen that happens housing prices have to come down because people can only afford so much house now can we lowered the standards sure we can do that for a while but eventually that catches up with us secondly what you see historical years when money starts getting more expensive people start backing off on the margin debt\nThat takes away demand for stocks because it's taking money that was borrowed that was being used to buy stocks it's pulling that money out\nWhen you reduce demand then what happens to price will price falls and so what you tend to see historical years before price falls you'll see a fallen margin debt now we haven't seen the ... on march in debt occurring yet but interest rates are just starting to move up\nOver the last year the U.S treasury tenure raiders moved up about a third okay it's about one percent higher than it was about a year ago\nJust that that's a big number okay even just you think about the government debt okay we were at two years ago we were running a deficit of about six hundred billion dollars a year now again that's a ridiculous numbers actually more than five trillion a year because of how we do the math but that's another show\nBut okay it was about six hundred billion officially this year it's about nine hundred and fifty seven billion that's a fifty percent plus increase in two years\nAnd then here's the killer it's not the fed raising rates a quarter of a percent a year it's the fact that the Federal Reserve isn't buying as many bonds as they used to what's happening is is what they did\nThat until two thousand and Thirteen and they just kept buying new bonds and they bought about three and a half trillion dollars worth of bonds well starting to two thousand and thirty and they stopped buying new ones but they rolled over all the ones they always had someone that bond came do they would just buy it from the government again and that kept the government's financing costs down well\nLast October they started what was called the rolling off balance sheet so they stopped buying so many bonds and for the first three months of this they didn't buy ten billion dollars worth of bonds that essentially came off their balance sheet as they matured\nWell this October this month that number goes to fifty billion so for the next say year and change okay you're going to have about seven hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of bonds that the fed owns that they're not going to re by\nIf you've had your increase in your debt ... your deficit by fifty percent three hundred and some billion and now you have another what's to say for a year you've got six hundred billion in bonds that the fed currently owns that they're not really buying\nThat's a trillion dollars worth of bonds that you have to find a buyer for and if you haven't noticed we're not everybody's best friend in this world it's China is not going to step in and help us with that Russia is not going to step in and help us with that and by the way everybody else's broke anyway\nSo who's going to buy all those bonds to yield two and a half percent\nWell the short answer is no one\nSo if you now have this huge supply a bond you have to sell and there's not a big increase in demand what happened is the price of oil price has to go down which means that yields go up\nSo now all of a sudden it's more expensive for companies to borrow money so they can't buy back as much Stockton there have been the biggest buyers the stocks out there is more expensive for people to buy stock on march in housing prices fall\nThe government budget gets even more out of whack which means you're even farther behind on the debt side which means you're going to issue more bonds and it's all of this is going from a virtuous cycle where the low rates made mortgages cheaper made stocks cheaper made the government budget affordable\nTo where now it's unwinding is turning the other direction\nHow long will it take to play out I don't have a clue and neither does anybody else but this\nHaving to sell the new bonds is going to be a a job I Would put it this is a big deal okay so we want to make sure that we're prepared so again the class I'm teaching is before the crash profit and protection strategies for any market\nThis is not a gloom and doom presentation this is the facts this is where we are in this market here where the valuations are the market may still go higher that's always possible we can still make money with these strategies in that market but\nBy the way there's also a lot of things besides stocks out there we can put our money into and a lot of that stuff isn't sitting at all time highs and ridiculous valuations so we'll talk about how to do some of those things and the key thing we focus on is if you look at a chart and you know what you're looking at you can have a pretty good idea where the people that have the money to move\nThis market are buying and where they're selling and all we're trying to do is learn to do that\nSo we can buy when they buy and sell when they sell and also understand that we're going to be wrong sometimes so how do we protect ourselves in those times when we're wrong because we don't want to lose a lot of money being wrong we'll talk about while strategies we'll talk about it in some strategies it will be trade cool\nSo if you want to

I Would tend to check the soil but now it's still a great time to plant you don't if you want it to you I Would first go take a few plants up and just see if the soil looks different if electro rocky and real porous\nAnd if it does what you do is when you replant just take bigger holes and mix them dirt and throw some rocks out so you have more soil and their for their plans to grow make sure they're not drain old too fast but you know since you are here the the the check this time of year too now with a new landscape and irrigation system\nAnd you know most plants that are established now should be water no more often than once a week with your desert plants so if you have a landscape make sure that the the irrigation this kind of reprogrammed\nAnd that you have water that um is going to run you know weekly and not daily a new plants\nAnd then I have another on orange trees out well we don't want their land their you know you want to hear\nAll of them are really [noise] you know we were watery like our next door neighbor because we're we're talking with them about it than we already said they're really thinking\nWell you know yours might have been you know stress from a few years but here's what I Would do is ... is if you haven't fertilized them this fall it's probably okay to fertilize them right now but really the growing seasons about finished\nWith citrus if you want to get the trees happiest and recovered and back and really to produce best for um the best quality free what you want to do is you want to start to fertilize them in February around Valentine's Day\nAnd for trees that aren't as healthy fertilize them once a month with citrus food\nAnd water them once every two weeks very heavy through the wintertime and weekly in the summer and I think you'll you'll find your trees a comeback ... can live over a hundred years and older sister says aren't as happy tend to rejuvenate and come back pretty well\nBut extra you know deep irrigation is not so often fertilizer for trees that aren't healthy once a month is great you know our typical fertilizer pattern here is the holidays what's it's basically Valentine's Day Labor Day Memorial Day\nBut if you want to fertilize monthly for treason aren't as happy it would be a great plan\nHer\nThanks curl graduate ... don't be a strange recall any time\nOkay thank you bye girl\nA next step we release and Chandler good morning Lisa\nGood morning Brian wonderful weather cycle we're getting pretty unusual is that\nVery very unusual okay I have two questions I have a um a ten year old lemon tree that is just going nuts [laughter]\nYou can see them and I mean there's so many lemons on this tree that all the ... down to the ground and it's just it's just ridiculous [noise] can I uh can I proved that\nWell what I Would do first um leases I'd start harvesting lemons 'cause they're still pretty expensive in the store\nYou know it got murdered Italy commercially their pick green anyway so if you're ... lemons into store they're coming from just six three which is like the area that includes Phoenix in Yuma and the deserts in California so the lemons you buy in the store this time of year\nAre from the green lemons off the trees identical to yours so I Would start picking and using the lemons that's going to have the branches start to raise up as they come off and they won't break and so start using the lemons and the time to really ... back heavy as after their frost before it starts to grow\nSo we would normally on our limit grows really do some major proving normally in late February mid to late February\nOkay now I'm ... and ... had grown way up I mean it [noise] it was supposed to be the smaller lemon tree I I don't know what\nWell I'll be happy and enjoy the fruit but here's what you wanted to do what we do with him and commercially and the gross is you know lemon trees can grow twenty five feet by twenty five feet quite easily but\nWhat we do with ours is every third year we chopping back to twelve feet\nAnd we do so so that we can harvest the fruits up on the top of that will reduce your fruit vote for that year\nBut it's got to keep the tree back at you know inform and in shape and not to get so big so you're going to have to kind of maintain it pretty low but every year and then they get the best quality lemons what we do is to kind of open up the inside of the tree so the light comes in but not the direct sun\nAnd the ... the branches and the canopy fall down to the ground on the outside of the tree\nAnd your best fruit really and the lower branches and other than interior portion of the tree\nSo I'm very aggressive pruning on it in February would be ideal and and don't be afraid to cut it it's like the puppy dogs you want to have without a tail it's easier to make one big cut and take a lot off it if you do at that time of year in February the tree has a chance to put out foliage him recover before it gets hot and can sunburn so that really is the ideal time\nOkay so ... now I'm waiting\nHardest now improved in February and you know that I still have some fruit to ... you know to harvest all the way through April\n... and I can have that that high canopy back\nWe definitely do you know when it at our farms you know like last year we talked or orchard and we cut off about seven feet off the top of the whole growth wow now\nWe cheat we have a big hedging machine that comes through in most at like a lot more but you know just making some big her well it's just too much labor when you have thousands of trees but you know basically at home but you wanted to just prove those big shoots out probably down to about ten speed and just cut him off and let them re fully open up the center lead the canopy on the sides\nYou know we kind of about twenty four feet apart in a line erase you want to get more trees you might plan of his closest Fifteen and a lot of grows your plan that were there were there cross space where they're twelve foot one direction and twenty four the other so somewhere between twelve and twenty four feet\n[noise] all righty thank you I Want\nYou to have a nice weekend by by I'm ready to take a short break we're gone mia reopen lines number to call six so two to six o five three nine for this is Carlos and Brian here with the filters regarding showing an absolutely gorgeous Saturday morning I'd KFYI already where the planet and I heart radio\nI learn real we know their car wreck still take the weekends often neither do we have you been hurt in a car wreck over the weekend you don't have to wait till Monday to get the help you need\n\n\nI'm\nNot been down there\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nLittle ... matter they both of them will get back to the nursery a\nGarden showing it absolutely spectacular Saturday morning we have two lines open the number to call six so two to six o five three nights where we've Carlos back you're on the phone to the music give him a call we can talk about anything you want to grow ah let's see next up we have Bruce north central Phoenix good morning Bruce\n[noise] take a morning Brian I wanted to find out if they had a good day to which are my bushes ...\nYou know Bruce you're a little late\nUm so it depends really on what you ought to Bush has to do and how you expect for them to turn out for the growing season you don't normally you'll ... based on the past few years this would be fine\nBut if you're going to prove back things like ... and if you really butchered them right now it's not looking like we are going to have enough heat for them to come back and grow very fast so I Would people that thought process\nIn a contemplate your you know how we were you wanted to end up before you proved them you know normally we would say burning them now you get a lot of growth back it would have five or six weeks of some heat it looks like this year uh the heat is gone and that being the case or whatever you prone is probably not going to regenerate very much until spring\n[noise] okay so I'm not concerned with having a flowers mhm I can go ahead and just butcher them back and carrot sticks until springtime\nWell they're going to fill in some you know you know we we still have temperatures in the eighties nights in the sixties so with that kind of you are going to get some new foliage and things and you know who knows what our weather's going to be like if it warms up in November November's warmer than October they could show in and actually bloom but you know just not anticipating as much growth is normal [noise] okay\nI've got to hide this plant one is going just wonderful in my backyard the other one in my front yard up against my house\nIs just not looking well I've got a heart transplant it next to the healthy one but it is a good time of year to transplant it gets\nWell it would be OK Bruce the best time would be in the spring after the frost so the first of march but if you want to move it now you should be fine\nIt should be okay\nOh I wouldn't I wouldn't be afraid to transplant I discussed right now\nThe other question I I heard you talking about topping off for I Believe you're talking about limited uh trees but I've got a um a peach but I picked up from you\nOr it probably right now about uh twelve feet tall ten to twelve feet tall and I want to take that a top four feet off or so is that a good idea to do now or not a good idea at all\nWell it's a great idea Bruce and the time to do it really is when the tree goes ... you're going to benefit from reading the ... come down and the leaves fall off to the best time to prove that peach would be in January\nBut reducing whose eyes yeah reducing it inside and changing the form so it spreads more horizontal is not as vertical is going to be very beneficial in harvesting fruit the quality of the fruit and the ease with ... you know even these harvesting\nSo it'd be a great idea to do but the best times January\nExcellent thank you very much by thanks\nBruce have a nice weekend by a Beverly and surprise good morning Beverly\nMorning how are you right we are snowbirds from Alaska and we have a wait a minute Beverly did you bring us any halibut or know how that right now it's hard to get get will you about fishing this summer I think if I have you been out fish in the summer\nOh yes yes and you are our family our commercial fisherman so the al ... is a little spin this year huh how that is very can share ah\nSo what about ... all that other good stuff that comes from Alaska\nOr we get the good guys famine yep salmon too\n[laughter] [noise] but my question is we are being shown Bert we've come down here we have a a key wind tree that is about five or six years old [noise] and it was full\nOf um a\nTiny tiny little key line when we first got it but now I like the spring when we had in Maine we had lots of moon but now we have no fruit hardly at all\nWell Beverly you want to make sure the ... real consistent through the summertime\nYou know when you're gone that's when it's going to be most critical and a lot of the fruit will drop like in may and that's pretty common they have little fruit followed him really with most interest especially when lines in orange is you're going to have fifty percent or more of the fruit up to Ninety percent with a warrant just fall off after its first that\nBut what I Would really recommend is the irrigation system you know set up you know going into next year we say in farming and like fishing there's always next year maybe it'll be a better season\nBut what we want to do is make sure that it were the trees deep water and about once a week and then you want to keep the fertilizer up for it for the whole season uh when do you normally leave Beverly\nWe normally only um mid to late April\nOkay so you're leaving you know right at the ... what you want to do what I Would do with your tree to keep it as best as put a fertilizer and they're going to last for the whole summer so I Would buy some ... fertilizer fertilizer with\n... when you leave in April and the ... the last three or four months and then make sure you have a big enough well around your tree to to ever get tape pertain enough water to go down two or three feet deep and I do water with bubbles or drip or how do you water like what drip\n\nFive year\nWeek I was down in Florida most um\nThe hurricane hit and uh\nWhy I wasn't here Saturday swipe Carlos do the best uh but we were down there fighting and all these beautiful plants we really never had you know a fall come on us this fast with this much cooler weather\nA nice rain it's just spectacular\nSo we've got tons of plants coming and we couldn't ship the ones out of the Florida because the hurricane this week but all week this week and next week and coming from our farms yesterday in our farming stand for we're loading semis to bring to town and guess what\nRain so much closer rode out we couldn't get plants down so we're really working I get to use the most fantastic array of plants you've ever\nSeen if you've never been to wish will come out and see if we are beautiful flowers you know dreams between these pansy snaps all that kind of fun stuff we have great vegetable plant perfect time to plant trees which fills me groceries from Fifteen gallon to big Seventy two inch box street yes you can buy time you could Planetree there and have shade next week\nBut especially have a lot of shade next summer\nSo whatever your dreams are whether it's beautiful palms from our own deserts\nTropical Palm Springs from the tropics or a wide variety of plants from\nYou know the tropical plant to the desert plants such a variety we can grow here come out and see if it were filled we've been here since Nineteen forty six now for four generations are originals stored eight twenty four he's Glendale avenue and the east valley at Cooper which is the same as safely and Guadalupe\nOr twenty six forty seventies southern avenue southern avenue straight south the sky harbor airport\nOnce we get the road back into our firemen Stanfield on Stanfield road just south of interstate eight\nHere in town were open Monday through Saturday to eight to five thirty Sundays tend to for going to stand Bill Burr open Monday through Saturday from seven to three except for when the rivers running that we can't get into our nursery but we're going to fix that as soon as rain stop where to put a new transport the bridge and there'll be a lot easier to get in\nSo anyway happy Saturday we'll be right back to the phones Mr tennis or Dell hello Dennis\nMorning Brian I have been killing a patch on my back pastor there where I get irrigation and the next year I Want to plant some stuff that you're most most of my stuff is on raise that because of the gophers but I'm going to take a chance and try to grow some stuff underground but um\nBut for the quality the blooms the ones that are developing you know between now and the end of the month the young you know shoots coming out they should be very ... vigorous the Cain should be back it up there not just given more fertilizer\nOkay I'll do that and by the way your crew a coup are great I I Will also indoors them\nWell thank you Alex have an ice rink and\nBig Kudo [laughter] by by\nAh let's see next step we've got a Bergen Gilbert good morning bird\nGood morning areas for him right\nI got a problem uh I dug a hole and mix the soil and like it says it's supposed to do it and I plan on orange tree\nIt died and I pulled it out and I pulled the yellow about an hour and it died at but only enter enter it died now what I'm doing is when I take the\nPlan out of the bowl a lot of the a plastic container mhm I Am as a separate into ... am I doing that wrong\nThere's no reason to do that bird and that's going to make it shocked I'm surprised\nThough honestly even doing so I wouldn't think would kill and ... and probably not even the yellow billed as a centrist is pretty hard on depending on the time of year and I would also be a little leery of the fact you might have put too much fertilizer and your soil mix might have too much nitrogen or I may\nHave done that yet so I should hold back on an action after I play\nWhy you should not use any more nitrogen all would I Would do leach the whole I Would put a hose there and let it run slow for a day or two\nElite solve the nitrogen away as best you can and that's kind of hard to do in Gilbert because you have heavy clay soil\nSo you really have to run it for a long time to train leach that out of that soil and then when you plant come back and play a little high or what do you want to put back in there now what what what do you really want to have in the whole\nYellow bell okay well the yellow billed should be one of the easiest and then when you read your whole dig your whole twice as big as it was before mix someone that clay soil back with the amended soil\nOkay okay so that you're blending it you know to a bigger area and so a perk better away from the plant don't tear the roots up on the plant planet back intact just the way it was and I think you'll be fine\nOkay very good I'll do that and thanks you very much\nThanks birthday by by uh Valerie in Mesa good morning Valerie\nProviding hey I'm I have some gardening boxes along the south side of our little shed and along the west side and we took out the tomatoes and things that died over the summer\nAnd wondering and uh uh had some confront things they got two big we took him out of my uh what can I plant now for winter darn\nWell where are you know Arizona supplies the winter vegetables to most the United states and so the easiest things to grow here this time of year\nWould be if you wanted to grow any you know for example garlic onions those are easy and root crops like radishes and and carrots but really what we really specialize in are growing the green thing so broccoli talk cabbage cauliflower kale lettuce you know all those green leafy vegetables do exceedingly well plan at this time of year\nOkay perfect oh how to pick them up and from the or do\nI well you can do for me either I mean you're going to plant the onions and garlic from sets affect you can just pay close of garlic and tear them apart and just separate amount if you want to grow some garlic but as far as uh the other ones you can grow from sets or you can grow from seat it's probably easier from sets and you know even commercially now most ... produce has planted from sets\nOh okay all\nRight well and then the final lettuce and that can you just like talk at it and it keeps growing or is that something is it better for a leaf lettuce our head lettuce\nGets the kind you enjoy you know really let us is one of those things are so many different varieties of lettuce now you know from the iceberg to the Romanian than a dozen other kinds of leaf lettuce um I Would just play with it I I Would put it in a mixture varieties and see what you enjoy the most\nOkay sounds great thank you thank salary but by\nThat leaves us with three open lines folks that number to call six so two to six o five three nights where we could talk about anything you want to grow water plant fertilizer kill certainly a lot of styles a lot of things to do here in our desert we have a beautiful Sonoran Desert which is going to be\nFantastic this year because of this fall rain is going to really help everything recover next spring and hopefully we get to winter rains on top of it but um you know if you want to grow desert things that's pretty we have very unique plants like this ... grow here you know pretty much just in our desert\nTo a wide variety of tropical plants we grow here food plants like citrus in stone fruits and all of our vegetables lots of things to grow here a lot of fun things to do Jay and show the number to call six so two to six o five three nine for Jay in Chandler good morning jak\n\nYes sir yes I was just to get out of the ... century it's about two and a half years old I planted in the fall of last year\nOr two years ago and I put a sunscreen around it forced the and then I put another sports eat on it a ... for the storm last week I Believe they are going up the middle of it about three inches\nOf burning split in the trunk or what kind of split Jay\nYet so we'll split in the ...\nBut in in the branches are splitting entertainers or the ... got a crack at it and it's like in the ... yeah to crack and well that is the tree gets bigger and they bark expanded probably stopped growing when it was real hot earlier in the summer and then it started to grow more with the more humid weather and the nice fall weather we're having now\nAnd so it's kind of normal if it's a vertical ... you know crack in the trunk it shouldn't be a problem for\nOkay stretch out Iraq that or do anything\nYou know it's kind of like a stretch mark from those guys are lifting weights playing football you know you see if you're a bit of football locker room this time of year you see the guy but that's kind of what that vertical markets now as far as the trunk being exposed to the sun you know avocados or like citrus the trunk should be maintained wrapped\nYou know until the trees got big enough can if you just said that the Trump from the sun and you know avocados typically aren't grown very well here and do be prepared to cover it this winter we haven't had freezes in the last two years but frost will knock it out so be prepared to cover it and frost\nAbout that crack the crack shouldn't be a problem at all okay well thank you nice\nTo have a nice weekend by by\nOh let's see next up we've got a foster north Scottsdale good morning foster\nGood morning Brian how are you wonderful quick\nQuestion for you that three or ... or ... or maybe three and a half four feet in a kind of on the north east corner of the house I'm headed for about four or five years they will not bloom I've been told there's different species of ... and some will not blown up any suggestion [noise]\nWell the problem is if you went

little sprinkles here and there hopefully you get some rain you know the rain is fantastic and uh never seen in October quite like this great weather to get out and plant and enjoy\nAnd they grew up in the winter so even though the leaves are somewhat yellow right now they'll probably green up on their own through the winter much but why does the fertilizer anything for a miracle grow to\nWhatever you what happened to have the might see other plants are house plants would be fine I like those will help the green up a little quicker a little easier and you know an occasional watering once every couple of weeks has plenty but say goes are very drought tolerant as well\nOh wonderful and the back yard though it has it has the gravel it has this huge top pine tree [laughter] which is really unusual so I Am you know press got in my backyard Phoenix in the front yard but um it doesn't have a watering system there the pine tree looks sort of healthy\nI was wondering if I can send a picture of it to your email or what so that you can see if I should I'm just I I think I Want to keep it but I was wondering how much care with that because they don't have a system in the back and they have two other trees but\nI'll probably be coming into your store to buy some other things that I mean maybe more document that I don't have to water very much\nWell Gail and I'm Glad you mentioned the big pine tree because of the big pine trees around town of really suffered for the last ten years and we haven't had these winter rain\nAnd so they need to be watered about once a month in the wintertime so if you want to get a ... and just throw it out there and if we don't get any winter rains at all wondering once a month really heavily you know put on probably four or five hundred gallons of water around that tree once a month okay and then when the ... yeah and the rest of the is fine so\nThree or four in ... this winter if we don't get rain and uh that really helps the pine trees fend off the mites and aphids and different things that we've had problems with around town with clients last several years\nSo I could just how is it off uh\nYou know you can put out there and just let it run slow you know for a long time and a\nHalf and look how the I was curious what it is\nBecause apple either in Aleppo Pine or a you know well\nIt could be you know Derrick

... Saturday welcome\nBack to the which one is regarding surely got two lines open the number to call six so two to six o five three nights for will get right back to the phones a Japanese Mesa good morning Geoff\nMorning Brian [noise]\nYou were here\nUm I have a question for you about the old tree [noise] are just not doing\nVery well I'm not dead but it is but we\nDo it um but when you start growing and they just ground up and they didn't know what to do to keep this thing going Jeffries didn't wanna rock what\nIs your tree planted Milan area rock area where he was a planet\nSo various walk but I have a really big yard so it's mostly goes or type area\nSo it was announced you what you want to do is you want to deep water you know here in the valley about once every two weeks in the summer once a month in the winter when it goes dorm at Disney water at all\nThere are a lot of different cultures ... around town and one is called the ... and the truth be known as beautiful in the spring and then gets kind of you know ugly looking in the summertime especially in August and September\nUm and then it can least back out this time of year so if you're looked kind of bad like in August and September leaves were just kind of than what I Would do Jeffers fertilize it right now\nAnd he's like a citrus fertilizer a good balance fertilizer now if you have desert it might be easier just to mix up some liquid like Peter's twenty twenty twenty and put down around the soil and what's nice is that we've had enough rain the soils pretty wet\nAnd so if you would take that and just soak it in with a hose you can go spraying and with the host or you can put it on this morning and perhaps we'll get another half inch of rain and that'll take it down on the cell you might get a really nice flush leads back out this time of year which will last until we have a frost\nAnd then you want to be a proactive in the spring you want to fertilize it about the middle of February bite before it's starting to really flush and grow\nAnd fertilize it then and probably again and like may but if it's the truth ... which I kind of suspected it is for it to look a little off every year in August is going to be normal what you don't want to do is you don't want to err on the side of giving it too much water in in August because they can be susceptible to some route fungus is\nOkay okay\nI have on a copper salty down taste it with having a problem so I did do that are in August\nOkay and what did you really want to do I think it's probably more of the culture more than it is and enjoy the fact that can be beautiful for about ten months a year and it's not going to be very pretty in August but don't over water in August\n[noise] okay okay so thanks Jeff [noise] ah let's\nSee county in Phoenix up next bill would you have some open lines folks that number to call six though two to six o five three nine for good morning Connie\nYet um [noise] I have a question on my back yard faces ... and then I live right in Phoenix and I I went I went up Planetree back there is this the best time to plan it up to what [noise] time well\nFor most of our traditional trees things like ashes alums pistachios a live oaks and all the evergreen trees now is the best time of year to plant you know so now it's an excellent time if you want something that would be very clean and you know an average ... I Would look at a pistachio df lawn or rock rock\nOkay so the pistachios going to be a treat is going to do be very drought tolerant just as tolerant as a ...\nAh you're gonna have to water very often but the big advantage Connie in a back yard and the average size yard is it drops it leaves for one week a year in January it's bear for about two months and least back out but you only have to clean up one time of year\nAnd so I Would look at a red push pistachio now is the perfect time of year to plant it\nYeah I don't want it to ... I Want to have a porch in the sun comes in through their it hits my door there and um I Do want shade um undermine carport I don't want it to town well\nYou can control the trees gross because you have rock a lot with how you water you know so you're going to control how fast and how large it grows by watering it a nice part about the pistachios it's going to give you a shade all summer it'll drop is least January and February when it's cold out it'll have you know you'll get the sunshine and again\nAnd then a leaf back out again in March\n... that's it grows very tall\nThey can grow to about thirty by thirty or more but you're going to control how it grows by how you water so if what you do is you're going to water it you know regularly when it's young yeah you know what regular refer pistachios once every two weeks in the winter and once a week in the summer and then when the tree gets close to the size you want you're going to cut the water off\nAnd water once a month in the summertime and that's all the water it requires to stay healthy\nAnd that will slow its growth very much so they won't grow so fast\nOkay nice\nBased on ... thank you Bye bye hang you too Bye bye Bye bye a Pam in Phoenix good morning Pam Hi there thank you for taking my call\nThank you for calling in and it makes the show more fun when we have lots of callers\n[laughter] I can imagine I accidentally came across ... than I was living in shallow over the summer and I plan and I loved", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Whitfill Nurseries", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "13"}
