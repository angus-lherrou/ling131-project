new to the show marry him and I want to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were\nA little girl correct a well were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth and spirits the problem is\nMost babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it\nBut he was he was talking to me and\nUh you know there was no question but would ask the question or the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person because I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did the did you always happen like that\n[noise] [noise] no I think than the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then\nIn ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time and\nBy so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open\nA white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through\nI can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all\nKinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough and it was it was the last thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this and\nThat she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe\nTwenty five thirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't go into houses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here [noise]\nAnd then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy\nI Can't walk into a house and be afraid because that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them\nAnd I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab Ian throw you into the light it still free will but\nYou're gonna leave this health one way or the other and now that I'm older you know and I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this is look at me and go sure girlie\nNot so much anymore now when I tell them to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older and then all of\nThem have you ever okay have you ever come across Miriam the double\n[noise] I think that and I can see him maybe three times or the ones that were so evil that they had come from the black cool yeah and\nI Would if I ever run across that situation now I really [noise]\nAnd\nWelcome back Marion ... with us Mary and when you were the consultant to the Gulf shores for television show did you have to step in and go no no no that's not how it's done\nI did that every week\nAnd I\nSit there on friday night and watch it and they do it anyway you know it's like oh\nMy gosh and then people would call me and they'd say why did you let them do that if like I did they\nDid it on their own in it and they knew better right of course they will love would call me up to date because she always got her her scripts you know like three days before the new one line which\nShe was good with you she liked to\nYeah and she would call me up and she'd go you should see what they're having\nMe do oh no\nNo but yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half\nHour they seemed to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made it\nTo Dr James van Prague nuts\nWell no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming\nWhat do you mean talking about why not that long so we're on phones bears like the ones I owe\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios\nAre doing a um\n[noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a\nUm is Barbara stand with standing there [noise] and I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the big Valerie\nAre exactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm start offering because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was there ... and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that and James meets mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just\nLet's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you\nAnd she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said\nHuh and I said have you talked to other people live people she said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it in she went in the light so\nI Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nYou remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady kept shining the light don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possessed or tricked her something sounds strange way to get the only change their personality\nI Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when I go with ... was being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right\nAnd so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was person on the ... whore house\nHe says and and uh and I helped you know work on that and I looked at him and I sort of squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what would that have to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies had nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold person I says why did you even do that it's like people they just they do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of it I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pains in my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that I had no\nIdea what you're inviting in and it's sad because it's usually teenage girls high school who am I going to go to the problem with who am I going to get married to\nHow many kids are going to have seriously think somebody's going to know that and the answer well gee we only as to good spirit to come\nNo trends you\nRight exactly and some of these parents they came to these girls when they were in high school their forties he's sixteen years old now and they still have this go with them never married are married five times\nIt's this this go is wrong this person's life for forty years and all because they messed with ...\nLet's go to the phones Marianne when ... with us we'll start by going to wane in Chicago and get things started our Wayne\nUh your your gift though who are there are low and I did it goes to go family we love all of you like your wine\nAnyway I'm On this one little like disagree with you I'm Sorry go ahead of though about anybody you know ... put on them [noise] a back ... back in the\nDay like you said or the back in the day when I was like maybe Seventy eighty before cable earlier than I was watching the losers shows like watching them a lot\nAnd these Christian pastors who were sitting on the ... and the thing about it is these Christian ... used to like go to sleep at night before they became group of gr through it'll go ... ... out of their body\n... would lose for legal mess with people and people who were so used to do this this is workers\nHere now but there during the ... group the minister was about ... the some of the people that they went to uh to her like fire around the ... like in the spirit ...\n... where we're losing broken through they couldn't judge them nothing you could Johnston because gun or to protect your actual fire around ... ... what do you think about the\nYou know what there's a lot of stuff I don't know about\nOh to and that sounds like it could be credible I've never experienced it but that doesn't mean I Can't or hasn't happened\nBut the everyday people that I run into now don't have that ability or that

have a way of accepting you have to be very calm and very\n... they know they could see how you are pretty fast yeah\nAnd I I learned from Buck Brannaman he he was a man there is a man his mother died when he was young a father and abusive alcoholic beat him he wouldn't shower and the coach made them stripped his shirt off any father well\nAnd then back in his father was put in foster care and it was a time when they didn't take children from their parents\nThat they did but they did that one\nYeah and instead of being an angry person um he turn into finding ways to help large animals that are frequently abused not be\nSo it's a wonderful story if if there's a DVD they made a special on him um called buck that they can get but anyway um there is a man that instead of going to anger turned it into something good\nUm my story hand now in Arizona and don't have time to tell you do okay\nUm I was on a trail right at your column monument and and uh we have had a picnic lunch you were on the

hanging in\nThe air and I know\nHow far was the plunge oh\nAnd um so anyway um the next thing I Know after I think she's going to happen when\nShe was a gun or divine intervention orange allocate eventually take if that\nWere still on the horse she was still on the ... and he walked that horse down that trail the rest of the way each\nDid she admit that she was over the cliff\nNobody asked about it nobody\nBrought it up but\nThe head wrangler who was in the front had heard it and when we got back he turned to me he ... he singled me out and she said that I hear what I thought\nI heard often and I said yes she did and don't ask me how it got undone she didn't even know duty but that he had been wrangler on allied with somebody did that and went over and was severely hurt and that's a miracle\nYeah it was so I called in with a miracle story that was one of the strange\nThat we should have said that for Christmas but that's okay\nAnd therefore I'm hoping that\nHe will do what can

terrible cards as a tool for your life are welcome back we missed you\nOh George so nice to hear your voice\nTo the the the new year is under way can you believe that\nUnbelievable yes have you been I'm good I'm very good actually today's my birthday\nOh happy birthday what a great time to have you with us you know\nI Know now I'm great how I feel really good\nThe world is pretty pretty insane right now I've noticed\nShe really seems to be out of control doesn't it\nUh you know I I just kind of want to say I was listening earlier and I was just wanting to say um [noise] we just need to really mellow out [laughter]\nWhen I really do there's there's just so much a\nSo in a way um the the tower oh here's a ... a credible opportunity to recalibrate\nI'm sure that we're now in line with deep deep blueprints of what it means to be a human being\nIs it a predictor\nOr that question you know that's that's a that's a a a controversial question\nI don't think so my myself um I I think it's more a reflector um but ... there is you can predict some things\nBut one of the problems with prediction from where I come from is um [noise] see I don't I don't believe that uh the future exists [laughter] um\nI you know I'm a or a present right power now guy yeah\nRight and it's it's all happening now it's all here interesting take\nYeah the future is it is a construct and show 'em when we talk about prediction we're looking at possibilities that are happening in the present moment\nSo and that way it predicts\nWhen we talked about the ducks card I learn from you sense that that doesn't necessarily mean one is going to die\nI beg to differ I beg to\nDiffer you you think now it means someone's gonna die\nAbsolutely absolutely because you\nKnow I always thought it was maybe just a relationship that could be that\nToo but you know what George everybody's going to die yes sooner or later everybody's going to die so of course it means someone's going to die it doesn't say when [laughter] so\nI remember you once asked me a art you said or if I get the death card does that mean I'm going to die and I said absolutely\nYes [laughter] and\nThen then you will elaborated but we don't know [laughter]\nYeah that's but that's true with all the cards in the ...\nWhy would somebody pulled the card if they weren't going to die immediately\n[noise] um well well it's a great question and and my answer is because um as far as the Buddhist say I'm death is certain but at the time of death is I Know right\nRight so I'm In in in keeping with say the Tibetan book of the dead the understanding of being aware of the reality of gas\nAnd living each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment is a useful way of re calibrating your mind and so it's a part of reality it's nothing to be afraid of\n'em it's not all that pleasant to think about it either but it's just part of the existential reality of being human [noise]\nUm and and all these uh cards most every card in the narrow really though\nDirects you point you to um ... ... spirituality I'm being more ... you know every reading at the end of the day says um get more in touch with your spirituality\nGet more in touch with your consciousness and I'm ...\nWay up to now that's what actually says Everytime\nNo you're right you're right about that and it also gave President Trump a boost because he was in the mid forties with approval rating is up to fifty one percent now\nYeah I mean and and that is because the American people are smart enough to know why not frog is being

they're they're looking at that again and trying to perfect it\nThat night that again it send the ring of fire you mentioned Japan and you know California the whole west coast ring of fire right protection\nThis morning I woke up and I read the shake now before the editors make a male shock to me and it was a four point one five miles from than what they taste\nWhich is right on than Andrea's fault where it could have the quake but they downgraded to a three point eight\nYou know that was why they felt in the bay area in northern California more than what probably five hundred people felt that reported it so I'm going to say California that's OK quake\nOn what come on it's a shaky hey\nI Know we're still who nobody wants a big quake\nNow that we need the tension relief I can say let's just say a five to ...\nAh the bay area Southern California at greater Los Angeles or offshore northern California before he ended up here at least a five to six maybe stronger but if we get that

I saw it on a movie or um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood dripping down the wall\nYou know George if I saw something like that I probably never going to another person's\nHouse [laughter] well you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last time\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debt debt\nNow can that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember karma you know be careful who you try to throw under the bar you never know what\nGoes around comes around that is true right but I mean the the recipient of the curse for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI didn't get this done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know what easily\nTo three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two are all three of them and in particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problem dating and you always had a good time\nAnd all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second data it's over right down the toilet so something's going on but if you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and\nHow to remove negative energy\nOnce that's taken off and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone you find the same thing with health if a person has a curse from them and they've got a bad health\nProblem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you'd have blood work done the tactical know\nEverything is normal there's nothing wrong with ... we can't find anything but gosh if you have a curse than you are negative energy I knew what\nIs wrong with you is not

three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying criticism multifaceted problem we're one\nWe're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly it's surprise me because the medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bombs we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribed vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nThe study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat show the vitamin D is absolutely necessary is not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone\nThat should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D were from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one in a non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading in the study you know I I kinda paused right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the her but you know you're young raise them and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victim we're office workers like clerks and people in hangers inside and I went home it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength can you do three formula help with that\nYou know critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially you're seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us this kind of a quandary thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's the lack of flexibility so you start to stiffen\nUp and you
