was you know like a you\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right\nAnd and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats\nBelieved her the men believed him don't women believe ... I've never I mean this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attack and this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people the the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other\nOther for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff and the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare this more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge them I think there's going to be fact I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument in its argument in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy no that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the sole thing you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell ya I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican

know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got a ... it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our in our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest\nWhat I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global\nHis lawn you know here you have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we were in the same position we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally taught and then Trump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to last night and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or at best Trump polls on it\nNo disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there there is a fifty fifty chance

well area within the can you predict out five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spent ...\nSo yeah what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over a ... about probably about late two thousand twenty two for ... uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back and then we'll start to see\nA global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states was kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities and things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent\nIt we're so far oil and iron ore eighty per se there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more money there\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nIron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah but next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nDifference on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it\nA real estate and more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course\nThe aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be has to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three two thousand and seven\nEverything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nHearing what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two\nThe disruption a around the world and that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's gonna be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nNot tourists let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because\nPeople don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that\nThat's our money they're

happen and I don't know I kind of think it will but I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few legs and because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nCome along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest\nInflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad\nBut the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if\nIf they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check so he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend that red line and being you know right if\nThey don't spend it or ... you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and the have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but I'm the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been there was kind of opposite in the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms\nWere over expanding and borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to ... money or pull accounts they're going to do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nOkay thank you and\nI think here he just answered that part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct and I got one of my parents were flying a light up I'm like oh hey humiliate crumble combat yeah ... ...\n... you know they play all about timing\nIt's all about time one of my guiding gloomy economic I'm tired of that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount\nMy Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of off the larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all going oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out a few pounds and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting so those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit for the positives more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller towns domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account\nWith your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't pay they can't\nPledge those reserves in little that's a good thing Carrie thank you were at a time here ... Web site at ... dot com psychiatry looks at the paranormal\n\n\nContractor license to eight months giving me neither\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions pre cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying the operations is\nWelcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this and for inviting me very interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric\nBackground would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started up\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories which my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath which states that are doctors should not repeat anything he's told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nType stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close calls with death so many Russians that death [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about near death experience\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's going back to talk to him and moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago I was right\nNow I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans as either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my clothes brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who has a classic near death experience [noise]\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of brush them off you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because\nI didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah\nThat was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOf this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOne of those super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he was an anonymous donor you about\nThe rule at the time was that after you when you I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise]\nSo he was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with them the dar happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is\nHere altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is a cheek swab that's it\nYeah just to ... to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang and then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know we found out\nThat he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what\nWhat was brought back to where I live closer but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between ... experience and what's a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say you're a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she may talk to him or she might feel just touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm and in fact you know an atheist and ignore sticks have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pee cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions of voices and so on\nDeathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of psychic experiences such as ESP until after the urge strongly common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that\n[noise] five times the most iconic

little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this phone so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice was dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I brings up another subject which is sometimes people received messages in dreams which on the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question hey where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could save coming from something they've read or we could say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear mhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nOr there's there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although\nWe don't really know and that and how how could we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke\nUp this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the ides of march\n[noise] that's right and in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate he ignored who plays also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their ... maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they'd disregard things which could be dismissed as superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride was Richard ... was above horse racing and they'll yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse spin on something else and lost\nAnd Dr seuss in movies screaming at you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe they don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a overseas and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors nurses um what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who is blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right yeah\nIn fact but then then\nThey said I didn't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were wow yeah it works it works yeah\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's ... and I think it's virtual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them fake cakes and people of the paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or Mr colder mysterious is well different words they use to describe the same\nEvent so I think paranormal event and have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every parent normally there but some do of course it depends on the Christian having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone who's hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the fake from a psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and in fact\nIt may be more than one voice\nTo hear the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing a voice\nYou have to look at the whole person because psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than an aside from the ... thought the ... or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\n... you played talking but in this type of thing so that it's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is that conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened that is a psychologist that did it an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be patient\nAhah but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they were admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patients me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they were unable to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out well unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes well that's true but but the patients didn't\nEffect because well the patients live with it they they know the on the cell well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that said\nAll right let's take some calls here for your Judy in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting\nAnd waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have my body but I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London\nAs an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front ...\nWell that's where I used to go as out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit that not legal\nAnd they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be\n[laughter] but you did that it is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I found the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been in for child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were fighting on the along with us canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven sixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat do you what do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping [laughter] out the other ones where I'd been out of body I'm just waking up okay between\nSleep in and awake but the most interesting experience I think I've ever had is what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed because I mean physical harm and there is no where on the love that\nYou feel when you are in that particular place of knowing what all income to sing love is\nAnd when I was during meditation at least they can and I could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles well this was alive light\nAnd the whole screen of my vision was filled with is glittering beautiful different colors of orange and yellow and\nI could hear the voice saying this is love and I was ... totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but I found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when they just I'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I\nThe last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou were saying I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called with the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of visions because I'd been up\nAll right well that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to function or whether is an illness that's interfering with their life\nSo it you can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia because someone with a diagnosis gets feeding it has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions\nAnd you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations compared to the actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell\nThere again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia and they can also be lists nations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting the person's ability to function [noise]\nBut I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of\nPain and other dark\nAnd places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think there must be a reason why she's going to those places\nTo go to Joe in Monterey, California Joseph go ahead\nA donkey charge a\nDocument as a Europe breath of fresh air and let me tell you thank you um [noise]\nI have a a two questions and I have a really interesting experience um do you ever do psychic fans and find that your sessions are better because of the environment as opposed to that say oh one on one\nAnd and do you know the work of Dr Stennis law for growth have those are spiritually virgins or altered states he's a psychiatrist by the way\nYes definitely I'm familiar with Dr grow up in terms of psychic ... I don't go to say take those but I have attended um international conferences on science and spirituality and I do find that when I'm with like minded individuals\nAre these types of experiences are more common\nYeah that that I could see that happening\nWell for one thing\nYou feel more accepted and you feel more able to talk about what's going on\nYou know you feel more comfortable\nRight right and you know you don't feel like you're going to get ridiculed or put down and I think it's important to a lot of\nWas that um that was my my brother's apartment where the second friend had little house he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and and uh\nThe at the end of a list tying the dream to my brother and me off the later and he looked at me and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead wrong him\nWhy there's a a pretty young lady that was wearing a quote a charcoal grey quote I'm cutting coke standing next to him I didn't know who that was a cheer before\nThis was in a in a dream yes that was all dream and ah and I thought you know and and every you know the people that I own a dream were\nLike all of a sudden the apartment was quite laid out I can tell you back your spot where when everything about it\nAnd um and so uh\nAnd I actually did try to take action I got life insurance and I figured there is a fifty fifty chance that can happen and it was the uh Thirteen months approached it was a well it didn't happen you know eight or twelve much raiders fan fourteen months so\nThat was a window that I was kind of paying attention and or your past it I'm Still here today I'm\nGlad he who was wrong\nI bet you are to\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available for I don't know Android ... listen libre on demand anywhere any time I go to go to ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\n\n\nThe\n\nNews I'm Carmen Roberts recovery jumps beginning on Florida's panhandle that suffered its worst hurricane in history Fox's Christians gets a helicopter view of Michael's point of impact\nAcross the street houses they used to be run down the road a lot\nReally Michael's\nMoved down to see as a post tropical storm dumping rain from New Jersey to Massachusetts American preacher Andrew Brunson may walk free today after being held captive in Turkey for more than two years\nAfter Brunson arrived at this court hearing I just before dawn this morning this may all be the prelude to a release perhaps a deal worked out by the Trump Administration to win Brunson is freedom\n... with the Trump Administration threatened sanctions against turkey if for instance\nNot really this is Fox News\nThis audio is for your review ...

latest book came out in November of two thousand Seventeen zero hour\nHarry what is going on with the stock market in my friend\nOr you know George we'd been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week in the whole ... just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction here which are already close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by sixteen trillion dollars are free money printed since two thousand nine and ... trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas\nThis stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than\nEarly two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed a you know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff and and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct ten or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that\nNot I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years\nLike a clock and we're coming right on that clock in stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nYou buy back in when things hit the bottom\n[noise] you know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be in high quality bonds and make money which she did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses it'd be preserved your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and just short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar yeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime ... nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on well what did the indicators I mean mark in the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history\nBut but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries what what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on a spree and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world and and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that bubble of anybody in any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash\nBecause they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop it they just filled the backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty percent\nOff absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay

R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six six eight seven three pie that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\n[noise]\n\nAnd we'll come back to ... with a series so if we quality companies that have solid earnings they've got money in the bank their stocks could still get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn in a recession or stock price like there's some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently\nCracked and a lot of companies went under well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you had a part Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so\nSo this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult to social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this cabinet shop thing it was just pure partisan you know the Republicans bullied Tim and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women ... I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think\nStates like California or the whole west coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed plumb the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd it's hard you know and it's our humid and hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the\n... the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna you know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year\nAnniversary of the greatest stock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is a ...\n\n\nWe'll come back to the grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well Harry within the can you predict outside years from now\n[noise] yes you know George or we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they would predictably spent and when they would stop spending\nSo yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks\nUh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities and things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent\nThere's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nOn George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course\nThe aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now an even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's gonna be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them\nThis is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming in there don't want given too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and continuity Arizonans and get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think Harry\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward and all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a fight ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're going to take your deposits\nAnd we're going to convert them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank so this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks\nThis happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about is exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars for the hurricanes grow up and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having had a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in ... here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people last not happening up here ah\nIn New York former Empire State\nAnd secondly California which is not friendly to business when people leave the state they insist on taking their short sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple\nOr to sum this up uh these people when they're left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote and herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times in\nVietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country\nIn a day or two you know with electro magnetic both et cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan I'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge\nIn World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising terrorists just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happened that this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries loose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we went so I think that's\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political jeez this trade war we said it's zero hour before this became obvious this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and\nThings like ... and Harry stay with us for coming back for final phone calls with you
