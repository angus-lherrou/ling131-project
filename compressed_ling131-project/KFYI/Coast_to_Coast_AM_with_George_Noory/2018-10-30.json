anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely if it does and it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] [noise] well it has to a large degree um\nI Hope they're replacing those trees or are they I don't I don't know [laughter] I Hope so yeah I I'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful manner very ecological manner\nI mean that's that would create another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of the men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in the last school it's Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout really use it that high on that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you want you you wanna hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut what you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're going to want us yeah oh excellent went absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born ... being born right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there [noise] uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y they that they are going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially as the parents of Gen Z\nA but it's\nWhat we're watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up\nAs soon as they have to feed themselves they're gonna be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWhat but let's listen here here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a concert\n[noise] so what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me\nThat makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a\nI mean unless it I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that did you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used for tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know if\nYou talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy

I I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I you know why don't we run our [noise] our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles\nWe used to have that\nYeah we used to have that but now we have a government that's actually run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no uh you know we were just taken all do we have removed the rules\nWhat taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat what will what's going on

they've committed ... the biggest demographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child policy\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they change the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born is that do\nNot buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing now and this is a real number\nOn a five hundred million people that were born five hundred million and a half billion so so it here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes that have a big houses and consume a lot state federal and local tax I mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAre and the the the\nStarting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well that will lead cooked himself because they're going to have it is actually a quarter of a billion elderly if they've got to support that can support themselves and now they they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that\nCan't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen in how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah ... whenever a country gets in trouble um with their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right exactly they go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war I I don't know what's going to happen there but but it it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they\nThey don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are a economy is not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour the cover of rolling in here for you Kenny\nGo to Dana in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have\nI called because I have a phone can pick a kill 'em but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a we're at war I'm not up on that so all of those how patients that have looked back in ... I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or has a Christian but I think this has a Christian and a woman I wanted to see you think you know first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the ... hour because she had nowhere to go in Haiti cash assets and that warrior yes what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off\nSo she was actually going to that he was he like Iran and possibly win a presidential nomination for the Democrats [noise]\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or tried to bring down that's nan but more importantly it man has had actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and blue and white\nAnd we had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school or by it and it but I'm I'm not that old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a thing that Smith and it should be run like a business\nI have started to successful business myself\nIs that men and women don't have time for now it's time you get a deal done\nWe're not going to have a meeting to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death when ward\nDiplomacy doesn't have money we\nNeed a businessman I voted for him\nHe has a no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet I Know or I I I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and she doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what time it's hard and other people know that ... ... ... it doesn't matter about his policy she knows who he is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nFor and let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\nWell regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking

are they they're in the military\nAnd that it's there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing

concern though not from a country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that the one child per couple\nYou cannot maintain a market economy on a

know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these

get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they

I grew up in a in a um [noise]\nIn our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away\nAnd he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh we were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral I'd I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd uh as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it\nAll of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was so to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of ... I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and\nShe you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and that but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh I I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now but uh uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out and\nSee what she was there very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh well do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it isn't offered it at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they say well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular\nI said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could've accommodated them in this classroom but\nThe five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and and uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common\nThey ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple\nThat are a little skeptical ... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience and really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe and an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun a that's\nA hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases it was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk\nTo them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying I think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression that are in my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not like out in the in the open kind of a thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent\nSpirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho couldn't he says the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to you\n[noise] I was the uh um the unfortunate victim of ... well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a lot of these things happened in Germany and West Germany Germany's a very magical place\nUm the ah I'm living in an old uh well in an apartment above a ... house which is like a a a German bar but there's like rooms to rent up above it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base\nAnd a one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed\nIt was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off the bed so I got up and there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I have to go get something you know some water or something\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating like there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving there was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time or her hand mirror\nOr a clock and a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off and I put them back on there and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind disgust house this bar and there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with ... singer I Hope\nNo not a bully thing will just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognizes I looked at him the vibration stopped\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifled but the last couple of days but uh making a practice of that type of mindful meditation and what\nMy spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class is to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused ... be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes\nBackwards in time as well once that door has opened\nBruce Lee ... go ahead yeah no that's

it's Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout really use it that high on that ... that's a flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you're on you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're good one I ... yeah oh excellent when it's absolutely

the biggest demographic blunder and the history of the world with that one child only policies\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate for uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born is it do\nYou not buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing now and it's this is a real number I'm a five hundred\nMillion people that weren't born five hundred million and a half billion so so ... here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes and have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAnd the the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well we'll have cooked himself because they're going to have a sexually a quarter of a billion elderly it they've gotta support that can't support themselves and now they they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble with their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right exactly they go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI I don't know what's gonna happen there but but it it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are a economy is not going to work period\nNo it's not much take some calls this hour the cover of rolling in here for you Kenny let's go to Dana in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred gang up your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have\nI called because I have a phone compared with you I'm just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a waiter or I'm not up on that so all of those how education that have looked in ... I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or has a Christian but I think that has a Christian and a woman I wanted to do things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the\nWiring star because she had nowhere to go and needed cash path and that warrior it's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he run and tactically when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nOn this with sold but work self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or try to bring down next man but more important\nThe only man has had actually a little one still at home I yeah now a little one but a young white and blue and white\nAnd we had a president and it's something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life if I did as if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a death net\nI have started to successful business myself\nIs that men and women don't have time for non Stan you'd get a deal done\nWe're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact\nThat you're saying we need more diplomacy opponents the death when ward yep home if he doesn't have money we need a businessman I voted for it can\nBe happy and no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had me on gas that he could get back up yet on the horse\nI I I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and he doesn't care if people fall in love racist\nBecause God Knows what time it's hard and other people know that ... I ... it it does that matter about his ... he knows who he is as I as a man and and uh and as a prior to that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nFor let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilets or you're the pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where Lutz not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that with their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done is dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nYou know I I have a house in um but either Springs Florida and and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and I'm In the house in ... Connecticut is four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just read all around it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it we're going to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want ... got to be very big\nWhile he's got that company like air being beat up the rent to our house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ... well yeah and\nI I Would I subscribe to that [noise] it ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes one of the things that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to remain\nIn place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nAnd I want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah K. juicy direct dot com K.
