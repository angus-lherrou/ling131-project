several minutes around seven twenty PMS what seemed like eons YouTube finally released a statement on the issue saying it wasn't clear at the time what it costs the outage\nBut that about thirty to forty minutes later the website was restored our expert on the Internet Lauren Weinstein where the floor and what do you think happened\nYeah Google isn't going to get into the technical details on those the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently was a global outage which is pretty much weird\nWell it it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video streams the people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so the fact that this was a global out it's just that there was some kind of access related problems centrally the causes and my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I were to YouTube dot com or you'd normally get all those little thumbnail\nYou would just get the shuttles that were typically appear before the video of ... that would be it wouldn't actually get the video [laughter]\nSo uh it's an interesting interesting kind of situation apparently uh there were people tracking where everyone went when they couldn't access YouTube but I guess one of the corn fights got a big spike spike\nIn there which I guess you'd expect some of the of some of the other other sites to [noise] um but but it's an interesting kind of thing and I'm sure the post mortem the post

clearly this is one of the\nQuote shouldn't be able to happen unquote kind of problem or the other hand as big as it is it is that the entire Internet and it is a very specialized kind of application so I don't think there's necessarily says anything about the Internet at large\nBut it does kind of make you remind it does remind you that there are central point that are potentially points of of difficulty for the Internet they're designed to avoid large scale breakdowns but for example if you have problems with a DNS you can have difficulty numbers of people being affected\nAnd you always have to do with your building their systems you always have to think about those well just couldn't happen kinds of possibilities because sometimes they do\nSometimes they do indeed Lauren thank you

great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans that they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse uh we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still with a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nFor about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for a much newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents I get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of servicers\nCheese and the ... these agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] ah and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guarantor so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before\nA President Obama these companies make out like bandage they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone that remains who's good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nTo rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans to rehabilitate they default again\nThree to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan if that's the fault again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time that the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us let's talk about if

is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often\nThan you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sun's\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans uh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out\nA and the federal taxpayer hum\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the tax payer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this was a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said as making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair\nDebt collection factors laws federal um a fruit in lending laws uh and\nThese again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who whose child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices are just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or\nEven state funding has cetera can keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year\nWell I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this ... program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is ah what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory a debtor gear marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst I see are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's a great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's the joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and how cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates\nIs over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that\nAnd and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college will you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you and\nThey got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of\nThe other day yeah there was a big signs they throw support the seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I drive a little bit of a trade school to a ... a company I used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the under the knife a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now\nYou know it it was a sad time but ah pretty much going on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I looked at her job over here\nAnd I found one but they wouldn't even let alone is with us or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing\nWell and I think well over ... years and\nYou probably in more and more experience than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I think it was up to her horse\nThere's no well you know like their way so I ended up going unless the thousand dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price down if it's not\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think of trade schools well you know\nEven trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place so\nTo Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that ... pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I I

absolutely be staggering this town that has been the biggest single revelation even in the UFO community for I I think decade I the only story that I think comes\nTwice and I would say this is the the

said the problem is that particularly with the album we have two little information about what's going on with the eight story with with these revelations we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just a confusing mass if you think back to when the New York

thought it was to protect us from some kind of a ... a intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks\nAre very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I

the star wars program and they read read a law into that to\nMy own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to ... when the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try to look like there's been there's still talk of disclosure are you you know I I'm arguing Steven bass and all the time Nick I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects\nDo you think that the things that are happening now our governmental ways of trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think the kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions\nTo answer about that no I I think what's more light clay and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the classification and release of the British Government you file your files we are seeing government say effectively will lick here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can release you know without compromising\nCertain classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either and which takes me back to the mountain ...\nCourt won't if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics to a chimpanzee\nYou never know you you never know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though what do you say\nWell he was clearly a visionary genius [laughter] I'd have been a time travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists\nWorking on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yep but I think there are some some others or you know I Am I had a job in the ministry defense where I was paid to sing the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work with the ministry you did\nAbsolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will fight cakes and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well\nYou know locate Soviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some trade ties that bind sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact scenario probably when what but if it does the payoff is so big wine on\nSo we actually did have a ... the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about grill flame\nSome street can dog ate the ministry to go into the briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd did a study which which was classified I think he quit ... it's now the fight and only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's it it wasn't a very good study\nI have to say it in some of the U.S\nProgram because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they so much but they didn't go out and talk to people that they probably should have talked to some of the people involved in dog ate and firemen from treat\nYour house and best of all it's completely free so to me by their dot com or download the free yeah\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd backward Nick Pope your questions this hour as well ... let's get back into these talks of congressional hearings what'd you think could happen and could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nSong ... coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house armed services committee have been looking for the ...\nHave been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the whiter question oh you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of the uh science technology and space committee\nAnd the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvil into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings be as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the space sub committee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think he will be difficult to get it away from the military frankly hit with a a military and intelligence\nProgram and I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed one of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks in its terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was a ... a forum to to discuss the UAE pay\nA mystery it's it's bad\nSo so you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact that there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings ... actually I Can't say too much about this but I I played some briefing\nMyself and I sit and they said that I'd be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things\nWhich I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been\nUm national daily newspaper reports that are actually going into the fight but yeah there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know all four of those articles or in British newspapers\n... one us so no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster is out there doing what they do to get the word on Nick\n... absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately only got the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nA it's kind of like like we said with alien ... and again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes when you're writing documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my article in the audience basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee in house home seven\nCommittee interest and I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this or fourth grade ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of a twenty five to thirty year olds in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety eight percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean of course all of the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand than we do I write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's the only ... but now I guess my my reaction should be well great like\nGets exactly gets the attention [laughter] absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies say Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again\nHey hey ah first of all you had to open up a show about a special report about working law and being at home and ... yeah I got I got I co signed for student loan you know that that's why I I gotta work\n[laughter] but anyway I make great\nProgram may grapefruit timing to top notch guy but a Mitt what an honor it is to talk to you my my rent or not my friend but third grade on her thank you Brian hey listen I my wife and I are eight namely why a lot that pretty religiously\nAnd in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like number fourteen or something like that come out in the ... the\nThat they they sign they could they scientifically proved to us\nShe did and he did now you said earlier that uh some of the believers in your new book or or movie uh we're ... we're we're the people that they ran into the labor were people from project we book and I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up you\nWere saying spring will not talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the con didn't report\nYes um that that was hum of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S\nAir force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO business or at least they wanted to ... the public out and and that's another point that we make\nIn in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the winding up of project Blue Book\nUm which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous\nA ball and a memo which which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for ... sake and on ... part of the blue book system\nSo so in other words the clue with there all along that that you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long how many years well\nMy goodness ah I guess I was appointed to the British Government fewer project in Nineteen Ninety One\nSo uh yeah that's more years ago and I can't mention of the of course I did that um for much of the early nineties and they stayed in the end Modi in different positions until two thousand and sake I never lost my interest in in all of\nThem were you interested in UFOs before you were put into the ministry of defense\nAlso told no I not interested didn't know anything about it I was simply assigned to that position I mean it was like here's your next posting and I was like yeah boss okay what's the job and ... and boy did it change\nMy life if you remember what was the very first case you looked at one oh my God\n\nWell I think I don't know whether it was one that actually came in\nI mean we go we go to a three hundred reports each year I think it was it was actually going through the old filing cabinet pulling out the old files you know dating literally back to the the actually the second World War but I'm I suspect was pulling out the ... forest file\nYou know of course I'd been told that the party line on this that we have to push with everyone was UFOs or if no defense significance and then I'm reading I pull out the ... file and I think I did a kind of wait a minute [laughter] what do you mean no defense\nSignificant [noise] did you ever know or meet Ellen Hi Nick\nI did not know sadly

I should add so that's a a something that makes this\nA predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair to collect the practice laws federal um a fruit in lending laws\nUh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with his scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprises\nA holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system [noise]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living in a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent to use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give it at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treated lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and um I graduated\nAnd found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is ah what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add [laughter] uh and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or that or gear marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got the student loan situations and one of the worst I see are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's got great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know his car as no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's the joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is the very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help uh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy\nUh Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nBowls yeas crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you and they got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they support the seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I drive a little bit of a trade school to a ... a former cub there used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the under the knife a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now\nYou know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much longer and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I looked at her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone is with us or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there what else do\nWell and I think well over ... years you know and\nYou probably in more and more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I think it was a two month course\nJust don't think well you know the way so I ended up going unless the valves in dollars on the grade school are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that it's not up for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon in Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on um it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college did\nOkay I already knew that bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's one thing they don't want to mention and that is the ... I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a forty three\nA and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sent to the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nThough the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are
