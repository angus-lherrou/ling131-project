I like to say that I'm as you I Am a student\nOf history and history she clearly shows that a civil war shakes around fifty\nYears when it happens [laughter] most people don't realize that they're already in the civil war\nTroop they acted when they go back and look at the things that have happened in the recent past they they immediately think that you know we are in a civil war\nEspecially when they're young something like ... symmetrical warfare and ideological warfare people tend to think it has to be always an armed conflict that's why the guy who was the definition of war and I says well it's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand\nAre are armed at times and at times they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars sometimes there are warring factions with in certain groups were there'd be right or left\nHow many faction groups have we heard the KKK the Nazis the communist or I could go down the list of black lives matter me too\nI mean just go down the list of all of the factions are at war with each other right now none of them pulling guns on people but yet we have somebody who ideologically disagrees with Hillary Clinton the Obamas\nAnd the Democrats and they send a pipe bomb whether it be someone who's deliberately doing it to prove a point or two at least create a false flag attack or if it's someone on the ... on the right doing it to get a ... out of a left\nBut no one has even brought up the shootings of the congressman\nThere not bringing up the other of rice and that was ... and the rice and it was about to President Trump this is certainly one sided and it's there just to basically harden the resolve of the persecution complex to the left it's obviously that obviously this is what is happening\nOr a yes or am I still on yeah go ahead okay I'd also like to say that um I Believe that was Mark Twain said a patriot as one who is scorned at first but when others join him it cost them nothing\nAnd I believe firmly that that might be Donald Trump\nIt might be and it might not be a history will have to decide that they'll have to decide that history decides everything there the last say Brighton, Michigan your own with Roger Landry go ahead\nAnd dangerous for taking my call I'm Roger said your for your service uh I think it's pretty clear it may well this was all these people who are target ... ... and we were all\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities in an intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it\nBut bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one and others throats\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas\nVigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents and\nLeaders in government is not the way to solve this problem in whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast\nBut the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public eye to eye\nAs soon as a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep those keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this\nAnd who ever did this with somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ...\nOr we will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... to show me as a heinous crime\nIn his first comments and some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death speaking edited investors conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been sold them and said that those responsible for the killing would be brought to justice\nFacebook could collapse of the keys being dogged by scandals or misinformation\nAnd election hacking says the author of a ... book on the company David Kirkpatrick says advertisers could start showing the platform if scandals don't stop after years seemingly endless controversy over misinformation privacy and fake news\nListen to this new development and fiber optics could make Internet speeds up to a hundred times faster by detecting light that has been twisted into a spiral\nThe research published in the journal nature communications can be used to easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost efficiency let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I like to make a technical comment on the fence today um I I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of the very short period of time as being very very high\nUm for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices that means all kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the UN at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us you\nKnow I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire us PF network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera that\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual\nI think the question always comes up when you when we talk about high speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it or the IOC is going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole oh occasion for the month in in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have come to ... be a new system in the high rent urban areas they haven't shown a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr die from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in South Carolina his scoop the largest jak bought in us history\nMega millions confirmed it was warm winter for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how the the he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with which that's right next on coast to coast they um [noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing\nShortness of breath or dizziness as possible you could have each real fair relation one of the leading causes of stroke mind out before it into a room with hardy among the FDA cleared personal EKG divide that just Ninety nine dollars to order visiting Amazon dot com and type ...\nThat's the Amazon dot com and type cardio ... ...\nIn your pocket you can take it EKG anytime anywhere right when you\nFeel or something [noise] cardio mobile delivers a medical greedy Katie right to your smartphone and just thirty seconds you know if your heart rhythm is normal for a trio feared relation is detected water cardio mobile today for just Ninety nine dollars [noise] visit Amazon dot com type cardio ...\nAnd I that same evening that same day in in the evening I um [noise] they turned off my life so I Can't even blame it on a train as soon as they turned off my light\nOn I was down to my bed [noise] and I was terrified I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was\nJust like I couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I had something shut into my\nMouth you stay with us sicker Russia will come back and talk about these demons and just a moment of coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am app is now available for I don't know Android for ... listen live on demand anywhere any time go to go to ... dot com and downloaded today\nNo dog in\nThe\n\n\nFox News I'm Carmen Roberts the FBI searching for whoever sent at least seven explosive packages to prominent democratic politicians CNN and others FBI Director Christopher Wray issued this statement asking the public's help saying no piece of information is too small\nAnd warning that more packages may be out there Fox's Catherine Harris President Trump tells a campaign rally in Wisconsin\nWe will\nKeep you up\nPackages were sent to Democrats including the Obamas and the Clintons one ended up at CNN addressed a former CIA director John Brennan a category ... storm slammed a U.S territory in the Pacific details trickling in from the northern Marianna islands worst super\nTyphoon you to hit this morning from injuries were reported the national weather service says you do is the strongest storm to hit us this year this is talk\nMonetary exchange you've heard me say the secret to making money in the financial market just to buy low so hard for the stock market in your all time highs and showing signs of popping out gold is showing signs of string\nNow may be the best time ever to sell some stocks and buy gold come by our officers on camel back road just east of forty street and the Arcadia district or call six so to six eight to gold that six so to six eight to\nGold or online at RMC gold dot com Saturday October ... information or to locate the take back their location closest to you go to a D.

are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know what do you wake up in the morning what how how serious already\nWhat's happening there out it's like it's like I'm I wake up one of the night and ...\nYou were talking and then when I go like into the closet no one there\nOkay so you probably have what what is known at the un called an earth downstairs so it can be\nAnd when I was like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nIt's probably not like the men it's probably just it may be someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really ...\nIs it possible with her so that you cannot get rid of a certain spirit that just lingers forever\nDoing a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with it and we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom Dan ... or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight to\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the show is to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to tricky aren't really creative\nFire remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not gas him at all he had you and I think in honey and was going to in he when he was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nA in this night will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes

calls from our listeners to with their stories so we're ready to go there\nReady to go to ship enough to be a fun show where you know stronger\nOkay thanks to okay so let's open up the first to secret door\nI tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd I mean how you doing\nOh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\nKnow not only for ... days of 'em up\nOh I Know I got older things get tough for\nIts intended by reading a mortgage Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed the\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell or it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm\nA before I'm going to limit the male hunger\nAnd yes you are an ID we need we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months without going anywhere ah against my nature\n[laughter] well I tell you why we love just stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nA at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder out I went to interview Stanton Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near ... big bear\nAnd I I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo they stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research [noise] well\nI think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or they could be sending a signal\nThe latest word against it looks like they're about one point six climates per star upper galaxy star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred\nBillion stars all that means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civil face in or around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave honey a room in other words for others and we come to realize that you know get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth Mary ... nuclear fusion for example ah it can get\n... ... are we also\nRealize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia or the world was created and four thousand ... see the ... campaign hilly beings around you know well it was off a little bit four billion be\nJust a little little uh our\n... natural we were not as\nImportant I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things\nThe ultimate you know hurtful thing [noise] um we're beginning to realize it's a busy place out there\nAnd there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the nearest once a month that they put in incarcerated\nPeople you know like yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth [laughter]\nThere you never know the way they've been treating people and it's it's it's you're\nStanding you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of hungry for expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that what we think there's one point six planets for stars so lead to a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here\nUh I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if there are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are [laughter] and there's still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the\nBig or or still slapped [laughter] and\nAnd so uh what most of us have learned that\nIf it's more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number all all no [laughter]\nNo and so what\nWe and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind eye it's about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that it all the\nPeople don't get the goodies of are on their work uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on my way to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a lot it appears to be close to what it is and I'm not going to try to

together we just didn't act lifetime\nEverything's good enough for people who need to know who you are Karen ... is the ... board person is that fair to say\nI think that there to say we\nNeed you Portland tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board it's dark will society ... so we diversify and all things ... board\nMarla ... a more moral Martinson believes the you're the greatest ... personnel to her\nWell she's very kind to say it that way she's very ...\nNow Karen dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves the ... board folks as you know I'm opposed to it I don't want to use it but Karen feels very secure with it I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nYour you have to do with\nThe use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also what why do you forget it has to do with your own perceptions believe in what you think about and how you see yourself within the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nFrom the place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around the world changes\nSome people believe that the ... board Karen opens up a portal to allow these evil spirits and entities to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and so I've been won't believe and that they're earning power that they are just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength then and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place that that\nKind of ... and beyond that kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different at somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your attention that\nYou use it only as a tool you have there is no hidden merits interviewed or power inside of these chunk of wood or cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of its within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\nHave you ever had a bad ... no I haven't had\nBad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing that and he wants in the morning this was many years ago this back in Nineteen eighty\nScrew through the board they were costing or the board\nBut let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage if somebody in life if I'm if I'm standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude\nI'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engaged because they don't you just make it worse and it's the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have board on\nA guy and going good and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs\nAbout where the energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything negative and I'm fearful of everything that's going to draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment within me that I could really\nA strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it than just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving the plant ya pure and is it the individual or is there some spirit behind it who's moving well let me answer that\nFrom a few different directions one as many people believe it's any another effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movement of your muscles through the power suggestion is making the plant shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism our memories them that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds that's one thought about it to a third one is\nA is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plants at the moving spell out messages\nThat's amazing work the way that happens in really absolutely\nAmazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked to him before I talked about um before on your show and work with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say when you come to the plant chat you set your intention and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just\nBetter results that way our energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning the frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequencies that we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows messages the flow the plants have to move and for the for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls or the half with Karen ... your questions and maybe your ... board stories if you want to share them with us ah I've never I've never known you though cure and to put somebody down if they don't like to read you board met I appreciate it\nWell I I you know that that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean he one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness\nAnd this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness OSHA and I'm not for that I'm for having discussion about it\nI'm for people having different opinions this tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use a tool that's kind of floor or a different one so I think it's great that we come together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong with that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group the talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a amongst us with all of us believe it doesn't work\nSome of some of the leaves at work because of eating motor and a few of my believe it works because we're actually connected with an energy outside of herself\nBut we can all exist together have love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so we're we're a group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning each other\nOn the board start in in ... how long ago\nWell there's there's there's a what Gene Gene Orlando has term do we just ... he owns the museum of talking boards dot com check it out um he turns it we just fish is because people say the board started back in ancient China and Greece\nThat is not true there's a different detonation tool that started back then the first board that we have a we have an understanding of because we have history of it we have documents that talk about it is a board Eighteen eighty six known as the which board\nWe know this board existed and it was made by a company called the ws read toy company and George the cool thing about this is it's really interesting history the people who manufactured this board\nSent a letter along with the board to president Grover Cleveland force for for his wedding gift and won't do this I Know and we know that because they took the opportunity to send that vaccine letter over to the Boston Globe who got published I mean there are matches the PR yeah now what do you think president Cleveland did\nWell I Would guess he kept the board [laughter]\nWell listen as we said that letter come to them and it says honored sir we take the liberty city by express today an article of her own manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention call though which board president Cleveland kindly wrote back and said\nI knowledge with thanks the which board which he sent me as a wedding present I\nAccepted as an evidence of kind feeling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I needed to be tested powers to disclose the path and forecast the\n[noise] I don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the ... board\nI Know and that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about what aspect of it that it can conjure up evil spirits which I\nThink that you can counter anything evil in your mind because I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that even within people they're evil all over the world look around it's people caught evil\nBut what I say it's evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too as we can have equal things happen and they are real bad evil things\nBut I mean just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I from my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool\nAnd away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose to find\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nI recommend it if a child wants to you that I the best thing to do is to not go don't do that because they are going to want to do it and sneak what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what do you what do you think about it what do you like about what do you want to know about\nI Want to go to come through that they want they you know what they want kids like that stuff of course\nSome adults do too I mean look up popular these shows are and colonel

they can this world and I do my best to share love and when I Do this work like bam you know she can sense that the ... the love when I channel and does this work\nI feel the pure love flowing through

is is used as like I did and and and it's worked well for her\nWe have a Shannon and Myrtle Beach South Carolina with us now Hi Shannon\nHi Shannon George ... how are you a channel that you\nHad a couple of a review board rulers stories I wanted to share that are actually the only two instances in my entire life that I Would add paranormal experience a first time high school sophomore and several of us we're at a party and somebody brought up with the board\nAnd I tried it with my best friend who was probably the only person who I trusted not to move it intentionally and vice versa and we both approach to ... because we were our school boys that didn't really care about anything at that point and west\nA ton of skepticism and immediately it began working within maybe thirty seconds of it working we both had massive nose bleeds cheese\nAt which point would quit but I didn't try it again and to another four years later in college it was a freshman at University of Kentucky in a a\nDorm that was a twenty two stories high we're on the Eighteenth four and a couple of girls with the one way or in a a kind of a social area will living area wasn't actually one of the rooms\nAre a couple of the girls were doing the wage board in that area that we're self proclaimed which is\nAnd was allowing me to ask the question when we came across entity who identified itself as a

it was the last show was look like\nAnd previous to this it was a completely clear night and it's brought up the word fog and we all looked out the window in the entire\n... there was we recover was the an inch outside the window\nKaren their clocks got us but I Want to thank you for being on the program and keep in touch with us it'd be careful with that we ...\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities in an intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it\nBut bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America as best we can debate ideas\nVigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate\nFormer presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on the way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast\n[laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who send these packages out maybe they'll go to the public can tell you\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag\nSomebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed\nAnd they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation\nTo try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy the gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all married\nAll right bye ... ...\nWe will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... as a heinous crime\nIn his first comments in some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death speaking edited investors conference in

expert Lauren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I like to make a typical comment on the fence today um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as being very very high\nUm Korea I mean these are all unexploded devices that means\nAll kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S some of them were sent through the regular mail us ...\nAnd then I just want to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office ... at\nThe post offices I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it or the ISP is going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put a high speed a new van system in the uh high rent urban areas they haven't shown a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr am I from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder and South Carolina has scoop the

water over your head three times in a row and before you go to sleep and in the morning set a timer\nClose your eyes take five deep breath and just repeat I Am the light of God I Am the love of God I Am the light of God I Am the love of God I Am the light of God and the love of God so you just close your eyes set a timer ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes at night\nOne of the salt water do grocery\nSalt water mixed with you know it's so amazing it just does so many things but it really just clears that\nOur our energy or aura right everything that we have anything lodged in everything we picked up from others it can also clear our own negative thoughts and you know everyone has negative thoughts that are created on a daily basis\nSubconsciously so the salt water pretty much just clears it gives you a good clean up the RS\nWhy those Kurdish work\n[noise] why does a curse work well good question a curse works\n[noise] ah because we allow it to work for a number of curse cannot work if we um [noise] it's our minds you know the power of\nThe person putting the ... the the job or is it the recipient who so my what should happen\n[noise] it's the recipient that's a very good question yes the recipients always a recipient that let that happen and you know most nine times out of ten [noise]\nUm it's because our our our was or not intact and I don't think I met anyone with an in tact ara but it's both and it can also be harm it\nIt can be comic person can be ... doesn't mean that you have to accept it because if you have learned you know you you said God or during the gods were the ascended masters were the angels and if you make it very clear that you no longer want this to be part of your experience\nYou know you can really do something like an on crossing and I'm release it from European but it's both but it\nBoils down to the person who is the target\nIt's usually are mines that are not as strong as they can be but it is possible for each and every one of us to to have a very very very very very powerful mines and when that happens persist can affect us we'll just bounce off\nCharlotte in Pennsylvania ... go ahead\nI Charlotte I for it they take like ... or my question they have this one he'll sell how when he'll know that much I just recently heard about that is that something you can do to yourself\nAbsolutely merging as always always got to explain the marching\nBand okay this is just on like you did you get the bundle of stage and you light the stage and I prefer just to stage when I make it so right at it after a hot bath I should've said that before and I didn't\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of\nThe show is to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to tricky aren't really creative fire remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not gas him at all he had you and I think in honey and was going to\nIn he when he was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nA in this night will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes next Wednesday Halloween Night or you're putting together a number of uh email ghost stories from people and we'll have the actual people on the year with me that night\nUh and of course we'll take calls from our listeners to what their ghost stories so we're ready to go there ready to go to ship enough to be a fun show organization minor okay thanks top okay so let's open up the first secret door\nI tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd how you doing\nOh boy this is gonna be tough I'm fine how are you\nKnow not in my ... a month oh I Know I got older things get tough for\nAids in reading a mortgage Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed the\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell or it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to limit the male hunger\nAnd yes you are an ID we need we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months without going anywhere ah against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you why we love just stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr an uncle in university and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this there is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time\nSo I took my Sony tape recorder out I went and interviewed stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known them ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research [noise] well\nI think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word gab looks like they're about one point six climates per star a galaxy star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion stars all that main one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the darn plays\nAnd you know that changes our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well\nWe're all over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars in that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're fusion for example\nYou can get ... or we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a special bus or the world was created in four thousand B. C. that's right it can be who may beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be\nJust a little little uh our\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her\nThey um we're beginning to realize it's a busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place now whether this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization I mean people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying but the nearest once a month that they put in incarcerated\nPeople you know like yeah like a personal glad boy guy's been brought on earth [laughter]\nYou never know the way they've been treating people it's it's it's a\nStand to you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI I think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of hungry for expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so like you have to like a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably coming here uh I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if there are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact pending land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think uh it it it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast and Tim full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are\nAnd there's still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the\nBig or or still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us who learned that\nIf it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced as much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number all or no you know and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind them for about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have we\nNo not at all the\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work [noise] uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a lot it appears to be close to what it is and I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy you'll be able to men in the universe and I've gone to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... personal almost kind of stuff in\nChief of the universe crowded [laughter] you know it takes a while I got here and there you don't get on your bicycle and go to the next stories [laughter]\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted but they're really it was warm maybe we put your haven't talked\nTo any leaders or maybe they ...\nYeah maybe they got all lately a raccoon enough is enough and that might not be surprising people\nI I have a great deal of faith in humanity of humidity gets pushed a little bit and ...
