O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases ah we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt\nThey'd start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of\nMel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but\nThe waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and\nI'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic\nEngineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient and in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about and who's going to do with the Robert what country\nThe Martians are\nThey're going to do with themselves so when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watch us through the ... are you assess and they bring us back\nA well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort what I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess Chinese though because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nSounds saliva put out and I think you said I met her get out there now email for credit card again use your identity to stay safe secure that sound them my thoughts and get your free\n[noise]\n\n\nI'll go back to coast to coast Robert Zubrin with us we'll get you ... seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWell I'd say China right now I'm is about where\nThe U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nAnd do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again I'm\n... there's a new paradigm now and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't do and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them and um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nMuch right now you have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think um the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons\nUh the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that well yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay\nI mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a ... presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go\nAnd um you know he wants upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nUh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen which not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThat you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know not Iran mosque office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit 'em so\nThat Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise] well\nUm\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you sorry thumping wonderful to talk about the office after I listen to your show [laughter] like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the light as though it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like the American like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right well here's the thing um [noise]\nThere there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a going off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature\nWild nature on America was wrong this we have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nUm nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars\nCan we get the ... yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine

at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot at a clinical therapist get involved in those studies [laughter]\nUm well actually I was interested in a go for the parasite college even before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually I actually got a day job and that I study the parents like holiday and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when Donahue

ah I have a\nDegree in psychology a when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied um basically the environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with the go study\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes my encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as a loose nation yup interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with\nReality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience so you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just go stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes counters what does that faction of some new perspective and insights in the car that he's throwing encountered um it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theory and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting for panic how going to anyone he would talk to me about goes all the conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with him and he's maybe theories are and that's where I came out the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews I witnessed the cow and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories

encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd um [noise] oh one morning I'm Me and my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was to be on the same way too normally she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take your shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nAnd I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this so I opened the door the dog and me went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in there by you know it's dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I\nFound myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside\nBut something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there some sort of like distress signal sent to me with the cat and distressing they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many pure normal experiences occur Brandon because the person who\nDied comes back\nNever had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of\nGhostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exists the memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place you know and and I think these things\nAt the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these\nUm bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent of the huge no\nYeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of a survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased it could help us move on\nThe crisis or grief or maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and I and when I talked to this these people that have these encountered they report feeling more at ease or accepting of the loved one death after the operation\nThat they got TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm can come out of it goes to counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something to look forward to it's just not a negative and demons and things like\nA friend and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and then counters the mothers what's so special about them\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd we'll come back to ... with us we'll get your goals as well as we talk about his worst the scientific work the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] um [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you um wrote a book about goes and are interested in love with the inside most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and they've all got one don't think they do and I was really shocked that you know 'cause you're kind of sit back and kind of weight\nWhen you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you know there's a there's still some colleagues who will come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they've you know follow it up with but you can't tell anyone or anything like that but the response has been pretty positive I'm you know if\nIt's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for human since you know the dawn of time you know does this go stuff sure I'm\nSo ... you know it's not that bizarre or out of context for that either\nAnd listen I mean parents that college he is a subset of psychology at the legitimate discipline just like social psychology and neuro psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university\nThey are the ones the clone sheep and a nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWant something that has baffled usual for Brandon that you don't have the answers for you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think ah any type of um\nHold your guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho cases where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you the ability of like with a poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call to goes moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that\nUm so you know it it's it's something I always read about that go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new goals seemed to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand

instantly as my ex husband he\nDid not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curia\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing my accent die the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw that image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a spy phenomenon and operation so as a man was experiencing a ten emotional shift related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a hello Patrick distressed message to the ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation a those types of things um and what's really fascinating is\nSince his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon by suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of a in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment\nA message tell a path ugly if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well but this is a great example of a crisis aberration side phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nWhen you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this is well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and um or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be\n... you know the most prevalent things but the idea is I mean listen we're we all think electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well an animal\nSure does you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nI've heard of people who walked by street lights and the lights go out and then as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm but it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only Constand an all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president\nTo sort of experience that operation a poultry guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever so for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always present as well since since the first ghostly encounter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause\nA ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter\nOn the other side of that there's this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes think counters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that it goes to this president\nYou know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that that goes\nA whereas if you have a fluctuating he amassed next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher\nRight um so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with goes laying out or even when I hear he's real life goes encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up for I felt the roof felt energized are like are there was it felt like a\nOf electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nGo to Jason in St Louis in Missouri to get things started hey Jay going in the\nMorning George like Brian question or do you believe that spirit guide you in walls and listen and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in wall Purina on us Brandon\nNo I I don't think so you know and and then this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see it goes that sort of I'm\nHanging around all day watching us you know like a TV um I I see the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times in certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before there's some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd and sometimes when people have interaction where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience of some ...\nYou know there's that intelligent hunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth bounce spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us that way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for that goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environment of the resonating the frequencies all this stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe've got Keith in Rochester New York Yankees go ahead\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent\nA shirt here\nSo [noise] you know these are two kids were or Eighteen years old and they were trying to get a job

allows people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about it pointed treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nThat worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars\nAnd was stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight big pointed a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is good coined or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin any of our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they

com\nA one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that so I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there have been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from there the man's school reform matory\nYep we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you\nSure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times\nA following ... but anyway uh my father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before they liked woke up my father was there became in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom sued up\nHer daughter kiss through and said honey everything's gonna be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and it was going\nTo share that with sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional issue will say Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's\nThese aren't negative experiences for the most part it's been in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences and their life changing\nAnd they ... from the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could have some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life it's going to join the Bronx I chose to go ahead George how are you Joe good [noise]\nA brand and yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe you relate a story about a full ... and and I seen um [noise]\n... um the question is do you think that there is a supplemental under channel of communication going on between ... and the recipient of that goes to experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously is discipline minnow a communication to wake communication going gone that precipitate the a ghostly permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related this story before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm [noise] he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and I it's it's during the day or at the foot on my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you may be elaborate\nOn what could have precipitated this\nDoes your does your brother pass away or he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a it's a ... for you maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay All right\nI'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question one quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know without the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there this\nIs an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother and I and when you resonate with something\nIt's not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there's one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and he has this feeling\nLike his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog you know laying in the water and injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then they you know wakes up cars finds a dog and that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprint and\nUh the study is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio or I'm In the car you can get it at audible as well so basically anywhere you can find a book she can pick up\nFor Brandon thank you love talking to you for didn't

convict the crooks\nIs to come at what they called el ...\nWhich is to go north end of the United states which has an economy that capable of absorbing these people now the truth is\nOkay for all those you know people that are anti immigrant and all this stuff\nIs that these folks that come across the border illegally are the backbone of being skilled workforce in the United states in every economic factor that you can imagine\nSo if you talk about a hotel or hospitality and meat packing\nAnd farming and it was just goes on and on of a industries that hire illegals including the president Donald Trump hires illegal to really help with the maintenance of his property and in the construction trade\nSo the idea that this has now become like a great political football forum is the flow of immigrants are not going to stop and they reflect\nThe failed states over there there's not going to be any reduction in foreign aid coming from Trump ... great ... a stump speech but it's not going to happen Congress's the one that allocate the money and they're not going to cut the money to these governments because George\nWhat they know is that if you create more mass poverty over there\nYou're going to get even greater more immigrants coming\nTo the United states but the fact is that we need these people essentially to Judy unskilled labor that nobody is willing to do because the industry is actually this country right now that they there's no way that they can fill those conditions were just the normal US population\nSo you're just saying let the seven thousand illegals just walk right into the United states\nCourse not but what I'm saying is that they when they pay the ...\nYou know to bring him across through tunnels or whatever the brake isn't the fences that go on that thousands of miles of border that that's going to continue going on and there's nothing in Washington that can stop it there's no immigration reform\nPackage up by any kind of bipartisan package that's going to stop\nThe flow of illegal immigration it's purely a function of failed states in Central America and the fact that we have an economy that supports this kind of a labor force and it's going to continue to go on in for an item\nIs is going to be a disaster John I just feel that something's going to happen here uh seven thousand migrants so about a thousand miles away from

for the chips he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nUm so if\nYou believe that uh you know the the fossil record on earth proves the existence of life on earth in the past in the air for that but life on earth in the present actually did evolve year\nThen you have to believe that if we find life on Mars and yet we also find a a fossils that that life is native I'm now on the other hand if we find life on Mars and we don't find any evidence that it was there in the past then yes there's a good chance that you brought it but\nYou know um that's like going to a foreign country and finding no buildings there just a couple of other people wandering around\nAnd he said hey did you just get off this plane um and if they say no we've been here forever and you say well where's your houses or they say well uh I don't know\nI'm ... than you might suspect that they're they're pulling one on you and they also quick to Iraq at the same time you did [noise]\nBut you see what I'm saying so so this scientific argument against going to Mars is absurd and ... and and this idea that we'll know more about Mars by not going is just crazy because I mean what planet we know the most about\nWhatever happened to the plan's your plans to tour for Mars and to try to develop an atmosphere\n[noise] well uh terra forming Mars is something that\nIs is going to have to be done in the future it it it's not something that ah frankly our generation is going to do it\nAnd it could take what ours if you are a hundred years to complete\n[noise] no it will take longer than that although I'm basically\nHere's how it goes first we're in our time we can send human explores to Mars we can set up the first basis on Mars and I'm hoping to be alive when the first child was born on Mars K. that's what I'd like to see the first\nHuh what a birth certificate that would be\nYeah there you go right okay so the first child born on Mars that is when we're really they're okay but\nAfter that we're going to have to grow\nOn you know settlements towns cities on Mars create industry is on Mars\nRuns that it's done which might be a hundred years from now [noise] um once you have a strong industrial civilization on Mars they can actually address the question of trying to change the climate of marsh and change the environment\nBecause first thing you got to do with Mars is you want to warm it up\nAnd we know how to warn planted some proven that right now on earth and if we wanted to do it on purpose we could do it a lot more effectively\nAnd uh the way to do it is to produce greenhouse gases um that is that ... the sun's heat a they're a seal too of course is a greenhouse gas but we know how to make gases that are much more powerful greenhouse gases and see it on to [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carpet in cash as we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth\nAnd the the uh\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the up the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of\nMel oceans fall I bet well planet\nWhy there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um but yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic\nEngineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient and in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country but the Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nThough when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back\nA while we'll set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family where the country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on the coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or read email newsletter today it goes to goes to um done um\n\n\nThe Asian Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area make over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nTo sell their shall I put out corruption I think you're probably never get out there now the mail for credit card again you weren't pseudo identity to stay safe secure and download my alarm store today and get one year free [noise]\n\n\nI'll go back to coast to coast rubber ... with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there are vying to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] [noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around\nNineteen sixty seven um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have do\nThey have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ...\nUm they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and that these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can to you in one there at the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them and um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have rule of law out there that they cannot have a government it's simply steals\nWhole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd um so once Russia to remain a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity a if you're going to be a first\nClass power much right you have to be first class in\nUm Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know I'm not a reason is a stick in a certain I mean the reason why [laughter]\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must have done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact of the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well it's it states that want weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all\nIs a state but it is a a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich they get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiff full okay to go [noise]\nAnd um you know he wants upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds uh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel\nIf you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThat you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you on Musk office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise]\nUm [noise] well\nUm\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you sorry thumping wonderful to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show [laughter] like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the light as though it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like the American dilemma Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right well here's the thing um\n[noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay they may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a going off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong this we have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much\nMore and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nUm nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get there that fast\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I\nI think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions are being launched a ... in the very near future that is\nBecause a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now [noise]\nAh it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims are people could get a exploration missions finance mind the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise]\nOh gee whiz the
