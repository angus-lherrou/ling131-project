you can help to breast cancer research foundation by making an inside guinea hen fades little things mean everything stage I think ...\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home\nA and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them and they accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises difference from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest is ... ... ...\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really is not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of their bodies\nAre energy fields or and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of worked in past lives um I had deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars or\nNational debt relief at eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six\nEight hundred sixty three forty five forty six eight hundred sixty three forty five forty six\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey human once we get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions and very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was against for years and years and years for fused all invitation I finally\nUh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over and one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and uh so\nUh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know\nOne couple said their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and there was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this sheet started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards paid no attention I said you know\nThere's places really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me\nY'all follow people home negative spirit's just they will get\nYou know that gets you later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh oh four feet above me was the miss shaping the spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible to describe\nIt was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was\nI did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just felt a looming\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely beyond the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I'm going to do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nUh you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious\nAnd so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot\nJeffrey you're really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the houses of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery wearing his different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around\nReally on a business or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and\nWell arbitrator you have to be God man jeans the title is Jesus\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord and have the gene means

appreciate that ... let's go to Angela in Fairfield, Ohio hello Angela\nMorning jarred Maureen for taking my call my pleasure thank you\nI was listening to Tucker Carlson of the Fox news channel ... um [noise] last night and he had a far left liberal female guest on that's had a group of evil which is we're going to get together after capital of New York this month\nAnd I don't remember that day they did give a date and I don't remember I don't have a computer to check it out but anyway they're going to put a hack on justice Brett Kavanaugh you know my son I Would like to ask\nThe good which is listening right now to cast a spell to block the heck\nNot a bad idea the guy's been sworn in he's our justice let's give them a chance to do what he does\nI agree one hundred percent and I listen to to both of them and that lady came across and I'm mentally and balanced to me um\nBut she was and I both seem to be telling the truth and\nHer face her hair kept falling in her face she just flipped the ash of old and I I'm you know she just I I think she has a a mental problem\nWell we don't know that but uh you know they both came across as telling the truth they didn't come across as bad people and it was just a horrible situation though just horrible\nAnd mixed up with someone else\nThat could be that could very well be a war you know ... years if he did anything if he did anything he should have said look\nI was Seventeen years old and I was with my buddies and I didn't do anything bad I just you know was too aggressive and I'm Sorry if he did but he didn't you know he said he did not final Texan tweet for the night what do we have ... you think Kevin I read that story which is\nOh I'm sure he somebody's got it to him [laughter] probably uh this one from Justin in

saw\nThe manager had a gun in disarmed or they didn't have a security guard is already taking doesn't say that\n... that's pretty risky though for the manager Oh yes number one what they always say let them take the money the banks insured you know don't ... you know confront them somebody could get shot you might have had a good opportunity\nThen he took it let them go you\nCatch them later you get your pictures on video everybody knows who's everybody is now\nBut you never there I mean he could on his back to them the could've been a lot of things\nMy point is that if you're going to pull a gun like that it's very dangerous people could have been shot innocent people let them go\nIf a guy who's robbing a bank the newer in their view run in a store some guy comes in with a gun and says you know give me the money you open it up give them the money and we wish him well I agree but if he turns his back on you jump on no no when he turned his back\nWell because we don't know we weren't

are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called\nModern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them and they accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by somebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than\nI deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercise is different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first
