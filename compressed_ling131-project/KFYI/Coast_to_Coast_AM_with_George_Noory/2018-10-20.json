C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser\nJohn Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the I an app for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nThat has um you know not met the criteria it's violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the stock a chain exercises you indicate that had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Germany a clear air force base\nAnd Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti\nMissile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their their passion\nFor for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of\nA civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania or the entire a former ah\nIt's satellite regimes ah that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result as you know really fueled\nAnd we need to have capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident impression that she is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing food and and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coordination predatory economic strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I should go to every one of those Richard and\nThere's a long history and in fact and I wanted to go through sixteen indicators and which do things just come out alive and they do like blinking red light and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interest\nIn fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for any time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I got a jump in here will pick us up on the other

eventually banished from ... from site when it flies off screen\nWhile we're unable to discern exactly what the anchors are saying it seems clear that Fernandez was stunned by the oddities rapid speed

are ... an organization that is run at the very highest level and basically for Strategic purposes and yeah we're concerned that it will ah manipulate\nThe information at a strategic level that will harm our interests are not only you know interference of elections [laughter]\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly now they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why you know the president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population and of course they won't negotiate any\nLonger with the Pentagon on you know\nThose types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that and they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so yeah there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might mean there's there are dominoes in play here obviously and wondering ... with what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states or the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Mohammed then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably you know it's been cut down a few notches here recently especially with [noise]\nAnd the so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course their their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with ah the Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about 'em but the reality is that um

Decatur\nA destroyer or in the grave and race in the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos fed it flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and air defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to Ford station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but there were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any end times scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president of turkey is really a fix to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um\nConducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA any consistently have had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so these are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together you see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives the Russian\nAnd the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou care to Washington and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ... from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to\nAustin in like ... it's just too rich so the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO extensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his his law make a viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or\nYou know for me to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of very removed and I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with Assad a

I don't happen to believe it that's just me but here's one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example a to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and please remember we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advises us in the end the physical to get out of those relationship those relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from\n[noise] then they may have to go toward but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships all relieved um I I I understand that when when the child is young there's no place they could run into\nA because it's if it's parents abuse and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what were overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take and it's up to those two people to come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern\nSo we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves and they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abused as they've been abusing they may educate them somehow\nSo there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us\nIt is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in guides\nAll right Joe thank you for that a friend is on the wild card line she's in Clearwater, Florida ...\n[noise] yes thank you for taking my call Richard uh three weeks ago I asked your help in winning a new roof\nOh yeah ...

some tools or what not had to give me more that is to keep you sleep longer well come September twelfth at three AM in the morning is when I finally woke up to my mother's voice calling my name\nAnd it was the most beautiful real peaceful place I've ever been in my life the most like everybody says the brightest light white light did not hurt my eyes whatsoever\nAnd my grandfather was down to their flannel shirt on sleeves rolled a gene is smoking a cigarette\nAsked me ... what are you doing here\nAnd I'm looking around trying to figure out what's going on and um I just don't I don't I

colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst group and his brand new book is called ...\nAnd the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast\nOh are you all I'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of the items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that\nUs national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that\nWe've tractor cruise missile we call the nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern is all that\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really\nCross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate and I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron\nCurtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished or when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later\nAssurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered\nA Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at it because\nA and the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and I said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in\nThe in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but you know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere's a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators and which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met

China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nThe information at a strategic level that will harm our interests are not only you know interference of elections\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not\nJust the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nIt's all these other areas that show national capability and national ...\nOur and we're finding that our adversaries are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world\nI knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nA appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those\nTypes of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nWill ask you\nAbout Saudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might mean there is there or dominoes at play here obviously and wondering what what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary a situation is is tragic but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably\nBeen cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nAnd the so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because are typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got a you know a way of doing

a program on you talked five fifty KFYI\nMellow there and things are tuning in this week's show I'm your host Chris and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems in the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly it's not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one or not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system it's a really long list and I honestly it's surprising me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bombs we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nThe study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nCan you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one and a non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading the study\nYou know I I kind of pot is right there I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the her ...\nYoung raise and and they're developing skin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers on inside and I went home I\nThought it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a clown the thing is\nThat people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nRolling from side to side you wake up with your knees hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to
