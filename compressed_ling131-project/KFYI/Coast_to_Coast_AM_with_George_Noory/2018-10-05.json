exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know as gr Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find 'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he\nFelt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you were quarter law and you know this was challenged ducked was challenged could you prove that there's life after the\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what would shift\nPeople's mind about that question and is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it it Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example\nWe are primed to perceive those parts of the world\nThat we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe the consciousness Lou outside of the brain\nI knew I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention to manage it\nThe product war and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy gives me like a\nHell of a better way carnivores has built everything back into my money in a while but you know what his bag with her and I ...

A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\nWelcome\nBack Dr Merrill Lynch ... with us Marilyn in this reality courtroom I'll do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife after death\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had\nExperiences that give them a sense that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience and they have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their life\n[noise] and you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions\nBut it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation sand and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHog the younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program you know I think our imaginations are very fertile\nI think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening well\nLet's take some calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either\nGiovanni hey how's it going your great I mean it's been a while\nAnd I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show\nAs always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth more a wonder and and and and after you into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine that I just really springs to mind when I heard you\nTalk about the about the forests are about the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are\nVery very uh very rich culture of um of mysticism and and also ah you know being able to travel into you know in three dimensional and\nAnd uh and explored the troop potential of the mind\nThrough um through an ancient practices and so it's been in the olden me over time uh the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm On my travels I was probably Nicaragua and then they and the and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called\nLess than ... or roughly transmitted the black a jungle\nAnd the this this lack jungle is just is an illusion jungle it most have been untouched by man very rarely a board still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered I'm lord knows what's out there but\nUh when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour in my meditation I felt\nWhat I believed to be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle ... it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and through a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered a bit bit fearful because I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment and I believe that this pure consciousness was was calling me\nOr or or trying to pull me into it somehow and I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there ...\nAnd the more we explore the world will find like you say yeah we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it as opposed to shrub union often not believing something is there\nWhat did you think about I'm so grateful for that comment and the question I appreciate ir supportive words and I think that one of the reasons\nThat many traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is\nThat a spiritual leader or you know the mistake who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered and that have this capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey work\nOr they can help calibrate that and you know keep you grounded in the experience but it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von to ah is no longer in this plane of experience but\nShe let this meditation where she took our identity into a bubble\nAnd the bubble left to the body and went off somewhere and I know that I got pretty lost in that moment and I thought if I didn't have the kind of grounding that I had I could see how some people could be very frightened or destabilized by that\nAnd in fact there is a woman I'm Willoughby Britain who is a psychiatrist and it's really been looking at some of the\nDifficulties surrounding meditation you know we think about it always is a really positive thing but it's also important to recognize that sometimes people can get into realms of experience\nThat they have no way to navigate and so I'm very grateful for your question and your comments and I keep exploring it's a great adventure\nYou lose ... Alice in wonderland that's the way I almost want to do the show\nYes George I'm er\nAnd you know in Maryland I'm so pleased to hear tonight what was being said and um [noise] I have the proof that there is the other side George\nWhen my husband passed away six years ago\nAnd I felt\nYou ... and I cashed out my next fell on the back of the you know yeah I like reading was cut off each you could have died\nI was that's what I meant I mean this is something that you know and even a priest when they came to get me to do that with the owner but\nYou've been through a lot and I mean\nWhat what led to grow as well right yeah and they came up to me when it came back they said oh this is\nAnd you know what he's already stretched and and angel behind him you know and George I had never seen anything so beautiful\nMy life and we never color t._v. we had was read us back into sort of\nCourse in those days that's all you search and no I tell you what I got it all the colors and when I hear your caller called in\nTo say they ... they ... they had been up and came back I find it very difficult to believe some of the story because my it was not like that I Know what it looks like\nWhat's yours was a good business was beautiful George and\nI Love hey we're going to take a quick break in a moment Marilyn was recalled Ninety four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things a couple of things one is a lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive\nAnd so I think what else is saying is um it really helps to have programs like yours where people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they had these experiences and there's something to you and\nThere's no doubt about that Maryland We're going to come back and take final phone calls with you in just a moment in Dallas you keep calling us all want you to get the Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven get to

my friend thanks\nYeah good luck Richard I really am were there with you\nA year comment reminded me of something dean or now she said it's in my book consciousness inhaling he talks about how the ancient mistakes didn't develop these\nMeditation practices in order to do better in a board room or relieve stress from the busy lives we lead but really to get to a state of enlightenment and and a personal\nRevelation and I think that's what you're saying there are these traps people get almost virtuous around you know I've done this or that or the other thing but\nIt isn't you know completely reflective of the grounding that's essential as we live into these insights\nMaryland do you think the believer is a little happier than the non believer\nThey say that I mean optimism is more prevalent with people who you know have this kind of faith and in the future of faith in society faith in each other\nWell somebody like Michael ... who's a skeptic so he's looking for evidence you can't find it so he doesn't believe a easy happy within themselves\nWell I you know if you asked Michael and I did a he would say yes he doesn't think that it's necessary to have\nThis more enchanted world view in order to feel happy that he approaches his life with a great deal of purpose with a sense of marvel all wonder\nUh and at the same time he you know has developed this line of where he is willing to move in and part of it I also think happens when people get overly identified with a particular position\nYou know so you are in that role of the ... the skeptic or you're in the role of the proponents and it doesn't leave a lot of space for that interplay of curiosity and just you know questioning\nIt's almost five o'clock in the morning and New Jersey Doug's with us say dogs thanks for staying with us\nThank you for letting me hold on there are pretty she just she knows everything machine running everything's good thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that a yes to your guest earlier or it might have even been in New Jersey to ask the question was somebody or it might have been a core um when you were asking about a pass Pfizer reincarnation someone or\nIf or most of these people who had this experience do they believe in God\nAnd uh if it changed your opinion are swayed it one way or the other I Would be under the impression that if most people have felt that they had ah been reincarnated or that they had a um a near death experience but it it would I Would definitely justify without ... without a doubt that yes\nThere is a higher power being called dog cheeses whatever the person's religion may be or a\n... to ... to come up with the thought that\nWe're continuing on and on for a reason or another that yet we cannot understand but yet if that is a plan there is somebody in a grand plan makers who had this all worked out ahead of time it it's just not like you say there's no such thing as coincidence\nThat's exactly right what do you think of that Maryland\n[noise] I Do think that people who have these kinds of experiences begin to reflect on a world view that is\nMore imbued with meaning and less reduced to material is um I think that's really important and I think that um you know the mystical world view\nUh engaged and questioning a wonder you know love\nA doesn't necessarily translate into a conventional story around what is God\nI think that sense of reverence for the mystery maybe a good way to hold that sense that there's something more ... reality and that there are different story line from different traditions that can help us to explain\nIf you went out and pulled people and simply said do you believe in life after death what do you think they'd say\nI think the majority of people do believe that\nYou think so and I think it would also\nDepend on where you ask a question uh if you're in India for example it's kind of a given if your I'm In a scientific academy at Harvard it's less likely\nYou know and treat the people involved like the metaphors\nAnd and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional lobbying and that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very bad places\nYou know I had to Lindsey Graham had it ran during the time I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population and increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors their individual and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates hold on it because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record what it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution\n'til I think he's apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to give some of the moderate you know problems and so that might get ... he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know in his tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\n[noise] any any time any one of the things talks ... support the violation of due process\nUm we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution the law\nTo to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame E. mhm and when I went to have me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law and it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that a lot of the people uh you know who've allow themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership that the Congress those American apology\nWe shall see how this all unfold gatherings website so Larry SOL A.

I mean the women aren't far behind [laughter] but I think I'm a graphic wise you know and we're going with stereotype\nSong you know I think I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film but I think ... has kind of been made and even with this new car or a with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to speak that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women and these movies that you don't Star Wars you know and now the doctor who was a woman I think that you know if a if it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies\nAnd they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of ... films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] no I'm not really [laughter]\nFifteen to twenty Fifteen to Twenty years old yeah I thought I Would I Would say forty percent about ... twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I you that a little higher maybe maybe fifty percent thirty to forty per se is usually [noise] thirty to forty I Would\nSay I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that maybe maybe twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year old and and beyond are probably a much much more likely to um enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going into a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them\nAnd bone only well and whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to I mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it um but I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual really I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience but a lot of times\nLess humid and that's your ... your business\nSo I I I'm I'm biased because I'm watching the audience ... ...\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who'd take calls next hour in addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you will when the last time you went to a movie\nOr you know what's interesting too about movies\nHow they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and these incredible songs\nAnd people were dancing on them in the movies man see those days are gone\nMaybe\nKelly dancing or to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra could dance like that no no I was surprising\nHow I always see in heavy using the cartoons that rail thin swaying next to a microphone I don't really think\n\n\nAnd won't come back to coast to coast Mr global with us we're going to get calls in a second now's a few people have decided they don't want to give their age and we\nWill respect that are in a not push them for their age though that means they're probably older than dirt and they don't want to tell you [laughter] [noise]\nSo Mr logo tell us since you've been doing this for years now when of course his team and in ... twenty eighty seven that and that is fantastic and you have fun doing that and that's important isn't it\nI I if you have to you know I mean you you at once it stops being fun at the time to hang it up you know a show at ...
