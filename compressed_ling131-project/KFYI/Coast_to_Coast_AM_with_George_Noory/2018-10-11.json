amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results that few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when a several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they

intention experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a a neighborhood in St

to St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis as a home property crime went up went up in fairground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent for before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so it's going on here\nAnd what do you think this is what are the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy

London\nTo she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue so this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWell we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on\nA with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group\nThat Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be your mother that would be an interesting ...\nWill you know we're doing one this at this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're gonna do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror of what is that\nWell the mirror effect to me was the biggest\nPiece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nTo the participants in these intentioned experiments\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff\nBut more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek remember these are people who were participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy\nAnd the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful they were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with\nTheir partner is that we're getting along better with the ball is in their co workers they were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect\nAnd when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to ... year with limbic tag or just talk about her work the power of eight is the one just as powerful as the age when\nNo I think I think you can even ten for yourself no question and you can have you know you can manifest things definitely um\nI've certainly seen that in my own life and seen it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know\nI I wrote about this is my last book the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never and we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater home we've never supposed to be alone and I think there's something about that group support\nThat group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness through something\nThat's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases wait in line master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers and they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is a badge of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person and that the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a group of strangers you know\nPraying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found Lynn in your studies that these abilities\nWe work uh for people of certain\nAge brackets of certain sections or does it skew anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young you can be older\nYou know I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff or people who are you know anywhere from their thirties to their seventies um it really depends on what they want in their life they ... I've had young people I've had older people\nAnd it it works for them I think it's all about using the techniques that I teach you know in becoming a a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things do you intend for and how to do it but also being part of that group and Jeff meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal and it's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of even of his depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as that we've treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened\nOver the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight loss wait the it got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man he um he chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung that Gump better he\nGot a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special\nI'm a special kind of technique and everything in his life with getting better and even his training you know he's he's um he's a trainer at the gym and said to him\nWhat are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve\nBut he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know I had insomnia last night and I couldn't sleep and Robert said don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention not experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what do they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good in tender I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it ... as long as your eyes or whatever you do\nUm but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having\nYou know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about my book the field you know we are and knitting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time\nAnd our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven and so if we have this one little power thought saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it and so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity\nBut probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about it being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a ... don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe will still in the gaps and that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes sit in the gap in a really negative way\nYou know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was\nA poll McCartney is a second wife um she was he had lost his love of his life Linda his first wife\nAnd he was mourning her and he met Heather who had been a she was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model\nAnd she was a glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and she lost her leg below the knee one of her legs\nBut she was very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who had lost limbs\nAnd that's when Paul McCartney miss her now Heather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly\nAfter pull married her and it fell in love and marriage her ... she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle\nBut I think you know what ended up happening is as the marriage got sour um she they the British press started digging up all this stuff about her about how she had featured in porn um photos and things like this\nAnd says simply Heather from being very famous and kind of revered was the answer to this\nAnd so I look at that case and I think her big problem was she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so\nSuddenly had consequences that they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's an age I usually tell people\nYou know what reporters have to learn is when they write a leader of a story they read in an intro they have to do who what when where and why and how and and that's not a bad thing to do and you're formulating an intention\nIf a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich\nIt talks about one percent a doubt can get your nose broke gripe cause your focus is gone I'm so no I'm divorced from the same life twice I have a daughter she's not talk to other stuff happens but I'm such a positive person\nI knew I Would be sixty one years old not working being taken care of and I am recently I could barely walk three years ago 'cause all the\nStrap ... of all the stuff now my ex wife to my friend she made it will be my third wife again there are times but I Will not\nFocus well on my intention even though I'm On my third book of poetry and stuff picture of all this stuff but I write in my poetry exactly what I Want but I don't really visualize I'm such a positive person I Want to have a\nA hippie hard center where people just come and visit and we do this ... thing what you're talking about and that just get them to be happy for a minute or a couple of minutes and go on the way\nAnd your suggestion that the little groups to change the world that is how it's going to happen so my question is I have I broke my body working a hammer gun for Thirteen Years\nUm I have ripped shoulders ligaments or actually broken so every time I worked out it hurt like hell so not only will not work out again after a year break\nI have to decide to myself that maybe that pain is actually growing and I should ignore it or not\nHave to happen again\nWell how does he get rid of it Lynn tell us when we come back\nOh launched not by

doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown you know I guess not but consumer reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about
