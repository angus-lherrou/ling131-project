it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a\nDrawings based on witness descriptions are they looked like a people I'm just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that a\nThird of matches what other tribes have dated all across the U.S and ah [noise]\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film I and it's you know people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings of and this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did with ah again one film it and wanting Harvey has the ability yet\nIf let's say somebody goes in to a bank Rob the bank has a beard on as a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving Harvey have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSeeking the with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair a face a Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Dick for it and it doesn't it it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\n[noise] well I think people forget how different humans are\nUh in my presentation to conferences I sometimes will take a variety of photos uh Amazon tribal members\nAh people from northern Ukraine uh people from China and I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different human well\nThey are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you're a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble uh they can't all look like that you know from its 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited ... worked in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed a playing with fire\nSo think about uh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire\nNot a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes\nMatch proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans do sort of chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book off to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden\nPeople have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies of people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth\nAnd you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious\nIf it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys\nAnd they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this uh Dave there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they describe them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nYou can ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge dairy farm [noise] and he went out there and talk to them in the ... I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely no\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my ATV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner the property I don't know how it got there\nSo dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of groups\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're unarmed of war and many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and I could two hundred and fifty pound deer native guy could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big foot wild bend a giants is the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast it goes to a um [noise]\n...\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to ... am dot com\nRandy your hand just amazed nope spring\nMonths spotlight now on the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI Believe in five of his top personal bodyguards or those among those currently accused in the Eighteen his personal bodyguards and one of them is said publicly a year ago I don't move which I don't think ... order from the executive\nIllinois Senator Dick Durbin on NBC's Meet the press gas prices dropping down five cents a gallon to to Ninety two for regular right\nNow the high end this simple of cities San Francisco three eighty five star regular grade and the lowest Charleston South Carolina to fifty fine\nWas truly lumber publishes the lone bird survey and the national average a year ago to forty six a gallon and this is Fox News\n\nAnyone can lead you to headline my roommate and being inside connections to give you the news in contact came and\nThese are guys get a good salary and their bonuses for efficiency sunny ... quickly when you need them and then do whatever you need done quickly and quietly and affordable\nSunny summer is not the queen now much use then their feet to leave you with a big smile on your face when you waiting by them and the tribal a sunny summer as well ... what does he is not the term in my youth in\nThe sunny ... exactly the way he was six and ...\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nTo talk to Georgia now called the wildcard minded he when he finds zero one one zero in on\nThe first time caller line is the one eight vibes zero one for civil to one\nTo talk to free from east of the Rockies call eight hundred feet to five bombs zero three three from west to the Rockies toll free go eight hundred six one eight eight to five ... ... ... am with George now\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney as they were known to do both had fragments of the individual songs put 'em together came up with I've got a feeling that was on unleaded beat sounded pretty good that's the Beatles with of course Billy ...\nWe're talking with Dave polite is about big wild man and giants archived articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty to his new book and as I told ... some of these uh descriptions of the writing is just terrific on the part of reporters from long ago this is from the state ledger in Mississippi July Fourth\nEighteen eighty for the title while wizard of the woods in which the reporter describes an encounter on one occasion heat the creature was seen about wearing a large fish with demonic hold greed in a short space of time between his massive jaws and enormous cheap\nThe bones being crushed as if they were straws this guy came to work that day and a and did his job we're going to go to the phones in a moment looks like they're pretty full day polite is still working his magic with the coast to coast audience we'll be right back [noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could add a trio the relation one of the leading causes a strobe light out before it's too late with cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device than just Ninety nine dollars to order visiting cardio dot com K.\nR.

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOr anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute\nThat I think about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on a PG film yet today there's probably pushed one hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrion short phone\nWhich has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the person film is real why haven't we caught despite that on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back to skin Walker day but it the the comparison is a pretty clear is that that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the colors asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes that you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can cook itself the change of shapes and it can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes her different topic difficult research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess\nYeah\nTry to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big what country Hey Tom how're you doing\nIs Tom on the ... are lined yellow\nI think Tom has gone uh okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two does that suggest that another a book of archived articles about these sightings could come some other time\n[noise] [noise] well not really know and and just so everyone knows this is a book to contain the actual article these aren't rewrite for the articles this is the real deal\nTwenty two was cut off point for copyright criminals articles oh so by more than you could print them\nAfter them you can't because they're still protected\nUm well it's a terrific a piece of work uh I Love reading it I I Want to go back and read it again because there's so many details that escaped me as I was preparing for the program but I I said some of the writing and this is just terrific and it's always great to have you on the program and I don't know what did you sleep but I Hope you're taking care of yourself\nI'm always I'm always eager to be on your show Georgia and and the response I get from being on your show is out of this world good so I appreciate the effort you put into it\nWill thanks very much I appreciate it and maybe we'll have you and get Melba catch them back on here some time and talk about that DNA stuff that'd be great\nAlright ... again the big foot wild bend the giants is the new book check it out if you get a chance in a moment we shift gears to talk about the true story of the worst\nThe disaster in us naval history and the fifty year fight to exonerate an innocent man Indianapolis coming up momentarily here I\nNever\nMissed a DJ on the shores yes sign up for the ... ... email newsletters available for ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis\nWas my roommate and I would ask or just someone that didn't listen to me about calling matter of fact how long did you wait a couple of years you kept hearing me and you do runs\nIn my family and it was my turn and then I had to do something medication or lose weight and when you lost the weight how quickly Fifteen pounds first two weeks how you look incredible what is your family said we've never seen your legs fish we don't know what you're saying\nI can hear the smile on your face what would you say to somebody that's waiting to call it hasn't\nBeen gotta jump I never saw Scooby me and your people every day just there's just more in the radio and here I Am seem surreal so you'd say make the call make the calls today if you don't do something disruptive or dramatic your life will not change I Know 'cause I Lived it\nYou can join them now for five weeks for Seventy nine dollars plus the cost of meals six to nine Ninety six Ninety six sixty nine next six to nine Ninety six Ninety six sixty nine or ...

the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nRight here in St George\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was the ship that carry the bomb in sunk\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I sought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah flash forward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was the theory hiding project from either way I got involved was\nI had actually been praying I'm I Do pray that my work and I had been praying to have\nOpportunity to work on an iconic for over two story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmakers named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm In being Indianapolis the storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she

commander ... other than we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of their their conscience conviction and um we were able to make great you know under ...\nUm\nWell with it and then more or published after the war first night to Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt and the uh here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of\nJapanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men are passionate a point of view and there was a chapter on it voted in Indianapolis that because we were looking at the larger or in the end of World War two in general we were able to really develop its personality a lot\nHe was a manager who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with data technology on Japanese that Marines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors after ... radar and more technology for his that marine because that means that marine didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brothers that commanders\nYeah not at all I mean you know the the shark population in the Pacific at the time was much more concentrated and from the report from the survivors you know there were hundreds of sharks are circling them at any given time and you know they would there would be frenzied attacks and I think you know and and I both heard\nYeah tend to stories of just men and you know having their buddy right next to them taking you\nKnow and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack there was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear and one of those harrowing stories was where\nKnow there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that there are rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realized things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirt and the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could have there's stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down sings drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and ... and by the name of John wolf than he actually took his socks off and thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized\nOh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship or the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they're having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the\nUm and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all\nAnd so by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got\nThat there were others who although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his now and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would\nYou know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and blood\nVessels bird blood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did so quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere as pilots who winds up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard ... and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd you know the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still went to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on this story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate when he saw this\nAnd it did line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after\nWhen were released about it that he when\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's

me your thoughts are when you heard the news I think it was last year that the Indianapolis had been found a who is this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier this some commander of Indianapolis and you know bill was contacted by the navy\nHe called me and since there they found the ship\nAnd I didn't know what he was talking about four in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe ... group which has the vessel that were ... responsible for finding the shipping and there's been several attempts than they were the first one is to be successful\nI'll tell you what Joe that's quite a bit to chew on their lips let them tackle at least the last part of that question a nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this with\nThe most closely guarded secret and the entire war in the most highly classified naval mission that the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and knew what it was and his uh his companion happening game now when it was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would have now and\nAnd I don't know that extra precaution with taken because ship with traveling so fat alma ... thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it ah the element of was carried on to the ship and a brief case but there was a lot of funny stories that were told about what might be in their right to Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this\nLarge crate that's delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or tend to toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur [laughter] you know [laughter] no one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter] you\nKnow I thought it was a a an odd post script sort of the the shifted self got blamed in the court marshal they were a thrashing around to blame somebody in the shifted self got blamed a which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was happening they followed that with the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser and Tara mentioned she had a single through back that when uh all the way through a from bad stern and\nIndeed in certain cruising conditions in the in the button that craving condition the

to make way through the water\nThe was just flowing in three that that a long three a deck and so um there were a lot of questions and the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she would open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on this question\nKind of the families who had last man on the shit I blamed kept the next day even keeping

energy to it\nIn the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on the first pages of new news articles and such and\nI started to come across these are stories about\nUm something that looked like when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it will the wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's convincing that something over the years has been\nAround us and it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago\nWhen your first year can you be kept the project how you got started on that what you learned and how it kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains at the ...\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave\nWe you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look well financed there you go about it at your own pace me no your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it so\nI I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm\nNot going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that they would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd there was no there was no way that this these samples could've been compromised yet as the paper was written up before I get there\nSo they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce melt with two of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this [noise] she listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it [noise] and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't\nIn Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples Phyllis tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found and that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles are ... are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been an old friend so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I chuckled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows house for that\nDecide to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our current news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I think it was like yeah\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it it sure seemed possible but again if you went in to the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some exporters wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\n[noise]\n\n\nThey ... you know looking back at your ... your original book the hoop a project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that a\nThird of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to ... to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned that has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or ape\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did with ah again one film\nIt and one thing Harvey has the ability yet if let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving well Harvey have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSeek and see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Bigfoot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\n[noise] well I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentation to conferences I sometimes will take\nA variety of photos of Amazon tribal members ah people from northern Ukraine uh people from China and I put these pictures up there and it it's phenomenal how different human look\nThey are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited ... at work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed a playing with fire\nTo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks at at humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big put that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because whose side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to\nThose conclusions and I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but in the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing from one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the\nMyth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and some people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies of people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth\nAnd you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys\nAnd they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it and say it\n\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we use the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I have not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to\nKill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and a invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror there an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and I got two hundred and fifty pound deer native guy could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's not a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast it goes to a um [noise]\n... we\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nMy name is ...

back Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and a claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nFrom\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nActually with a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about core and they reduced the story of a ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb and stuff\nAnd I didn't know more about it so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter]\nImagine that and you know there are looking to what was available at the library I still really find anything somebody's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought out what I could but you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah FlashForward graduated from college and [noise] well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and family\nAnd Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd when for you how did you ah hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work and I had been praying to have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since band of brothers but we only base mini series on foot\nSo you're going to be ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the lead and help her but uh eventually over the course of several months we finally met\nAnd then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project tickets and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on and so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nI'll tell you grab ... my father was a at ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us can our where your father drove the\nLanding craft and I'm In\nThe weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on the state full journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater um victorious at Oakland now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nThe accurate story however heart and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell was it like it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you you have to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're using them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat try one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on when you an apple a story because really the man uh before I get asked in order to to to you know circle back and the men who\nMarry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army name Robert an army major name Robert burning and he had spent the last couple of years after the war renting down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic\nBomb uh on the continent of Europe so one that messing with ...\nAnd then burn and very simple components of little boy in island um status final breathing yet or I've been to Europe and and if the conflict and so\nIn writing the whole book we try to pull back that ran in bringing in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures including the Japanese point of view in addition to hush money we had him for your call and tell me has gotten and how high the commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where you have to recognize it even matter of the men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what\nI'll tell you what are we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break we'll come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes day\nYou know we're fortunate that our daughters
