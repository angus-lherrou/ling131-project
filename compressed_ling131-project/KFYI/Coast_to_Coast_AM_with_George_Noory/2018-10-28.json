experiments that inspired Frankenstein so as you're heading into the holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way a this is a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction stories\nOf people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play but it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling science fiction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like\nIt was like a I robot both the ... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in the very first\nVersion of a robot before the ... version of a robot um the robot that is created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and reads

well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in say about the subject so it sort of\nYou use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications of the er the Salem witch trials are but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for the you know there are [noise] you know the first trial in America you'll victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims or get injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which has killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed country there's still we're being asked you for being with us but the strange thing about that to me of course all the season a planet that I've had this problem and it's pretty much every day on the planet\nThere's only one which city and that's still a Massachusetts [noise]\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I liked the rub zombie story there in the book to\nAnd then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either and that's coming up next our coast to coast am this is the impact\n\n\nBelieve in something\nEven if it means sacrificing everything [noise] sorry

anybody who's seen the Netflix series the hunting of hill house [laughter] because that's been the theme\nThey play as kind of a slowdown ... version of it in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was um Stephen King praised at a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ... deserves it just your great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight has very little to do with any of the other versions of the hunting appeal house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions where these slightly changed the title\nA but it was it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting appeal how so Netflix um is is just one of the rare or the Netflix series that lives up to all of its billing everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that they they make a point\nA lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit of rain\nSo it there's there's plenty to you know give you a boost in ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it was almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I go to

I I think what was I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out of jail than it is kind of you if you can test and said yep was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anywhere\nYou did write that ... that the nuance of the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck up for their beliefs only things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great works of literature and plays is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nAnd one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance\nTo the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result\nIn somebody not getting a fair trial [noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and\nAt one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train [noise]\nUh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two\nWhere true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something crime reporting must not go right true crime is ... allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules never one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or it satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nAnd not run for your life [noise] ah all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden or national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right\nIntent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media\nNeeds to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well I'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experiences on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up\nOnly a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about uh people who you believed to be guilty\nOf some thing stay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's

Jeff shot I think I mentioned the the um [noise] there's all their equipment geographic pattern and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curse just north of Portland\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten by Nineteen twelve blood the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um ah\nThe ah by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that\nUh and and break through his hadn't had had been achieved that had been done to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and it has a very infant pile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story than required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person\nThat ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen eleven a Nineteen twelve which\nWould runner and he was killing a lot of people\nBut the earlier crime we what we did was say look this this this murderer is way too experienced\nTo have started this in Nineteen eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow I'm getting audited walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got ... nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year or so successfully\nNominal luck and it is not all ... ...\nI had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series\nSo ah we just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this\nBut we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successfully after that\nIt is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was\nCarrying a gun all the time after about nine to five the uh I think that he while he used an ax who committed murders\nAnd writing demands from the train because he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that I\n[noise] you're you're fading out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no Kennedy that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime that night\n[noise] yeah they are uh I was saying that crime stories are packed into it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train\nI didn't make a deliberate thoughtful entry into the subject I just got hooked like a fish\nUh I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and all those guys were called ... living with a ministry it's an extremely well I'm a documentary and far above the normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively ...\n... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour into\nInto trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week and the week eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is is that true crime [noise]\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought what this all just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring it even though it's a hundred plus years leader\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities may be this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they have it happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a ... his great great aunt had been\nWas one of the victims of the crime Internet here and always believed that uh uh the man who uh\nWas accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um\nIt wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a shy you said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow\nI I don't know why it was important to him too well I understand the understanding that there was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut uh it it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think we can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all ... all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book here is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that the ... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nAll of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night\nAll of the things that that happened who happen to have happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death for that's a terrible picture because they look bad parable bath\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town\nOr a hundred years ago and I think he did\nVery effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed or their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that trait that party or the right thing and that has to do with the the taco in the case of taco him then that it uh one of them I think it would suck co were had an alibi for the time of one of the crime one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and\nHe had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering hay to his neighbors and an Italian community or a\nPickle deal because critical deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them the a ... it's ... it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of a ... of the way the entire universe and communities lived a hundred years ago [noise]\nExcept that it's important in a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know [laughter] but I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa um and the the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\n[noise] an an item of June nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nA dispute between the ... city council and the power company so they had city lights and street lights but they were out and ... and the town was in complete darkness or the Sunday night there was a church service\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers\nIn ... where there's an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue but it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that\nThat's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his rather that maps and trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in what night an adjoining how\nThe uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten\nOr many places many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but in some of it it's still quite well remembered [noise]\nSo I Want to ... you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the

lives with her husband not you [laughter] so\nSo it goes wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nThat we we we have a tendency to replicate ... um circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise]\nSo somebody who might have grown up with a very dysfunctional household\nTends to clean toward dysfunctional

theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and\nYou said you know somebody from being\nDestroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um\nUh again and again and again with more and some variation but more specimens specificity as he got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the the\nLater patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nThat's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that that's who he was that that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] and the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the ... that's what happened um speaks to the age in which he might have been\nSort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to be you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about in your interview you can have no answer you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh\nNewt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning\nAnd um preparation for the about ... I don't doubt that he had committed pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much which respect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while he had he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy and he said he ... it is the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a tanker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nDrew in about ... live the uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario it come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get out of ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great

writer\nA and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot it means he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was ... blogger but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know it means like even today we don't think about those people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are\nThey get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks I'm\nIll I've got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence from a ... like when the ...\nYeah I really watch any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand they act with which the whole list of murders were committed\nThey ah it it's still it's still around and and uh has been presented with a guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know what they call will buried by nature [noise]\nNo we don't it disappeared ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured out that he might have worked for the road it how it got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but a ticket for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might like we should that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhen it went out in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to\nThe um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the perhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that a lotta stocking\nBut uh the uh just working on solving that frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this here that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so ... if his crime and the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight eight did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and place followed his\nWhere he

anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly it is not Chicago technically but the um it's Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that the\nCase you're

that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... and the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that uh that that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the wife of the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for them yeah there are [noise] you know first for trout America you'll victim

they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which has killed\nThe honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being asked you for being with you but the strange thing about that to me of course the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the

terrific reviews from every corner ... deserves it just your great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight has very little to do with any of the other versions of the hunting appeal how's that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions where these slightly changed the title\nA but it was it was just ... it was great but I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror very suspenseful the hunting appeal house on Netflix um is is just one of the rare\nOr the Netflix series that lives up to all of its billing everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with with the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie\nIs that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it it there's there's plenty to you know give you ... ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see\nAnd that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went

the other hand for brings people into your shop that's uh net win for them so it it's it's again really complicated to like a fascinating degree their whole economy there\nYeah it's a little bit like come in here get outta here come in here what are you doing you know ... exactly that\nAfter they get the money anyway so then it did show you mentioned that that you know because of it being Halloween town it it it has done it and because of the ... the sheet shift you're aspect of\nOf witchcraft as it was perceived back then that it's also a town where people spend a lot of time with you know we're will and I'm assuming some of the other universal monsters make an appearance in Salem\nYeah so that's another aspect so we talked about it being you know which city we talked about it being Halloween town\nAnd then I also part of that they're kind of it's kind of horror land right you go down the street of Salem you're going to see not just which is which cost and you're going to the Frankenstein monster and you're gonna see Harry Potter and Voldemort you're going to see you know the Addams family all these guys over there either by informing the actual street performers or as visitors\nUm point that if you're a horror fan like horror movies than fail and you've got to kind of put that on your bucket list along with you know universal studios and some others in Hollywood and other places you want to go to the\nUm horror movie side so it's become a mecca for that as well so it has all these facets that kind of tired all of them are dark I guess the the um common denominator but they're all different than their own way\nWe're talking with Jay W Oscar a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts um and at the same time you left the pirates right 'cause there's a there's a connection for probably the tears in ...\nThe sale is built on the maritime trade there were some of the first people in the ... and our and well not the country at the time before leaving the country\nWho sent who've mapped out the Asian roots of trade like the first ever millionaire was a failing right because there were so good that trade overseas and of course that comes with pirates there's actually a pirate museum there and say on the line with the other stuff\nThat you can kind of learn about you know they have similar stories to most of the east coast for all the kind of pirates had out here and there so they have a whole entire pirate chapter their history as well which again is another kind of weird layer the story of failing to have\nLike I said earlier like two dozen layers above just being the site of a trial and back in sixty nine to to\nThe uh yeah and it it's not just a trial of course to rages series but still this trial it was just fascinating to to talk about it earlier this year in in for people who have\nClosed in center you know back and listen to the show it was ... I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out a gym that I think it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah I was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anywhere\nYou did write that ... that the nuance of the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck up for their belief all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature and plays is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population using under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just it's like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some business is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really years they've been getting\n... more a year round kind of tourists\nIt's not just for the Woodstock but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or to pull a tourist and still happens the biggest one is October\nWhich will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair that can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down roads and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nNetflix or you know cereal as a podcast or whatever whatever place it is that those narratives are so good and there are so valuable but why and that's what I study\nAnd one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder\nAnd the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result\nIn Seventy not getting a fair trial [noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means\nStories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses\nEmotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call and letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train [noise]\nUh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two\nWhere true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something crime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nAnd not run for your life or all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we\nTell and the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right\nIntent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes\nTo conspiracy theories as well I'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rest some the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only\nA small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy\nIf everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media would be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever\nYou talk about uh people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am this is Ian puppet [noise]\nCoal in could try this kind of stuff so I had I lodged condition he's also a killer is harder to stop talking out of ... it was just incredible side of the nation from what I have the auditor and [laughter] long flight or something\nMy thing which will
