turned her this is pretty creepy when did you learn\nSo for people who don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service with their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's a location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument\nAnd it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico on February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere and I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and ask them for any documents on that case\nI got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any I said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles in all the reports said that they stayed at she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money she loved the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument\nAnd she slept in her car that first night February first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site\nWith a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do exactly you know I Wish everybody would do that but then as I went through this I started to think\nShe was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second\nNotified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined Carol was laughing eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service store to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base\nThey brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that at the care would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seven one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh off the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for a review of what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth at too limited locations about four hundred yards of park on the south west facing of the hosts a J. O. S.\nA very strong and distinct human odor was found but no other locations supervising ranger how cross of swore all\nThrough our national monument in one of the researcher who was recently involved in the recovery of a body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than vacation at the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and noticed\nDistinct other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never in thousands of reports seen anything described in a national park service report of very weird and scary\nFlight guys that yeah\nIt's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there's no source for the older\n\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nSo I'm sure all of us have spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\n[noise] but uh again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no\nThere's nothing left of her family anymore\n\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon tell me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know I'm going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents\nAnd I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine salmon Butte trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood\nAnd for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old he's an intellect\nListen every hour starting tomorrow morning at five twenty\nFive KFYI autocrat any auto glass offers one hundred and forty dollars cash back with every insurance replaced wishy on premium glass uh best warranty and guaranteed best cash back off air show us your ... and get one hundred and forty bucks back all any yet for eight zero to to wait by three nine zero or eight dash eat\nHis radio ... new trade deal reached between Canada and Mexico and the U.S United\nStates Mexico Canada agreement us MCA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed under the new agreement exemptions on terrorists on two point six million cars and did Gary agreement does seem as the Trans Pacific partnership trade agreement rejected by president\nTrump boxes and carriage White House insisting that it is staying out of the week long FBI probe of sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh white\nHouse press secretary Sarah Sanders on Fox News Sunday said the president only allowing a week for the FBI investigation into the allegations against judge Kavanaugh is not micromanage meant\nShe says the president is familiar with the judges background but we'll wait any new details from an investigation boxers grown all Scott Fox news we reward huge aside\n\n[noise] we have you on that day in terms of exposing\nBeyond masking all of the deep state although there when they favored Sean Hannity tomorrow afternoon at one point you song\nKFYI\nHe's young on being done great and it was discovered a fantastic way to relieve old ice cranky muscle aches joined planes that really sly began\nYou ... ... ... can change not once but to keep my body ingredients that would fight to give me lasting relief ... plus right to kick it back and change the ... really good ...\n... ... and has a place in ...\nWhen I put it on a field ... ... woods through the woods for you to if you didn't do the job with the bank with one hundred percent money back guarantee Kim on\nJuly ... pain relief green to die and do what I'll do rebel and the judge Joe Joe ...

creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota the community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north

respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the ... early they laugh early on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location in critically at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep in California and left the link the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work\nSent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle at first got on to that I thought you know this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap\nYou know it's in the middle that triangle ...\nNational park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... where you wanted to get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances\nHave a case in the books from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California\nIn forty two what's the deal on that one\n[noise] so that's a I grew up not far from Marshfield in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for\nBeing a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise] [noise]\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out a treasure island where they held the world's fair there was a man by the tenant earners Cody twenty seven years old and Ensign Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the pharaoh on islands\nAnd Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military and it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for a person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen Fort function calls Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship were off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each\nA airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel was in the tanks the radio was in perfect condition no distress call for funds been called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a postcard ship that saw the blimp dip and drop to wears on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nI mean there's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and when we come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nTo find them ... and I just logged on to go to ... am done\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do\nYou become America's Best selling for ... it's all about relationships with your customers in the community and services like some\nWe live in homes technology as as\nSoon as the lowest some\n... is America's Best selling Ford dealership Sanders since ...

got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left in a craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak right because the the\nArea of the water was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of getting Walker rich you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I noticed that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works uh in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere is also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle ... that had happened and he went to base and\nAt the circumstances were it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them uh their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched out of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that uh a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in getting Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged\n... and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with the larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wake up call I think\nSo um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area\nTo see if there was anything related to a disappearance that I could see my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but as I said before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water\nAnd when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's a manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation they use a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity of the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now anyway\nIt's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had a brother or your books and and\nYour subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\n\nBiggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already are

I'm going to tell you a store or an actual experience\nBut first I wanted to say I think that there's the the higher echelons are working with the parks that won't give you information they don't want you to know and my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about\nThe uh the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the Buddha\nTalk about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true\nIt it was before nine chain Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm gonna send me an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man a woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around out seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name [noise]\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks and the boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bumped them but this is the part I Want you know it had kinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that appeared were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe [noise]\nWell that's quite a story a Dave any reaction to that\nKnow interesting\nYou know you do have some uh ask well thank you for calling with that and the the other folks who are on the phone hang on because in the next hour or I'm going to

your books David and I'm not sure if I don't remember an example here you you referenced that about an earlier book in his new book about the boulders\nAnd I I was always wondering well heck there's boulders all over the place how can that relate to the missing persons a mystery\nYou have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story my last book one right before this about a story a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing came upon this giant piece a pink granite in Texas it's a state park [noise]\nAnd he said that as he ran up to the top of the granted it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside the Boulder he guest made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that isn't the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories out of Iceland\nThat they will move road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a belief in their society that things are living inside of those boulders\nDave are polite is a missing for one one land air water is the latest book it's as rebutting as your earlier work and I want to thank you for coming back\nFor a million George\nA will be in

Washington Glen welcome to the program a lot of weird stuff happen up in that area\nHave you ever heard of the river off lake area George\nI have not but uh please tell me about what's what is your experience been\nWell back in a way I had friends that went camping hair and a half crank varian um my friend's wife was going off into the thing is my friend that he might read high looking at him\nAnd he had a whole is white back for like the wrong way raptor and there was like ... and stuff I think of like a greyhound\nA hey you know just walking on a plane and hand over heart later on a couple of weeks later or being dragged out of their effect on me and it never was ever I think it was every ... every kid you know anything about that or\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the ... I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff for a very long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spend some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nThe two girls there's no way they lifted any way and even to adult man that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up like a four hundred pound HEB and somehow getting it over this huge tranche and mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this is a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses\nBut I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise]\nUm they were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like if aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans\nIt was like they were too perfect not a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly calm they're close I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nThey just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[noise] they kind of stopped and chatted they\n\nAct out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat [noise]\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I\nStopped and I I chatted with them probably probably two minutes probably two or three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake and like I said I just got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in and kill after the fact and you know I started thinking about well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road itself [laughter] you have the loans\nHow weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there's been some strange strange events or I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big for research or that the records their their sounds it was\nIn those sim woods where

went down to look into stars who binoculars\nAnd I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what you're talking about um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody

guy coming back Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nA George I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today\nThat you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to yeah you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into some of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities\nSome of the missing to your own life right [noise]\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are the upper echelon and it it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the\nHigh rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to\nVarious circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nThat has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil the evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out one from help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there have been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kind of guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families uncovered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a common one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions\nStops searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports\nThat the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind\nAnd there's been in for just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI I find that baffling well\nI mean that's how they've treated you I was gay and ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction\nSo when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done\nHire a cure for the auto glass in the valley for over Seventeen years social cracks and

uh during the break there that uh you've got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\n[noise] this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is that can ... missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know it's somebody of talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect can't end this thing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right I'm a ... for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use aero Flynn on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most time a lot of times they want there is a case from eighty six\nAnd there is no way no way they could walk there on their own or talk about that than I Am\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and a couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida was found twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book\nBut I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data because in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen well these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary\nAnd [noise] and extraordinary height [noise] when I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hand and I said if I said OK you set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away or watch the child would child going to do for the next hour they said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and your think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise] but I have all these examples where the heights of been achieved by these little kids\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know an incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nA yeah it's got to me and we talked about a two year old boy that they just\nHe traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was from face down and you know the next morning unbelievably of why we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and a half months that we couldn't believe we found him and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go point six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible unless somebody pick them up for some something or someone picked him up and slapped him there\n[noise] [noise] well and and the reason these cases have significant is that we'll see you report on a child who's abducted in downtown Vegas\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure as probable somebody put 'em in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks and nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody saw any cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make that distance in that time ...\nAh in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one\nThat happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona ready to take a break now when we come back this one has really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy\nI Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David polite is going to take a break the ...

Turner this is pretty creepy when did you learn\nSo for people who don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service it's their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's a location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument\nAnd it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico on February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere and I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and ask them for any documents on my case\nI got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any I said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under an all the articles in all the reports said that they said that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money she loved the outdoors type regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument\nAnd she slept in her car that first night February first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car\nParked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger smart smart thing to do exactly\nYou know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving the snow I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that you sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search\nWhether it was described and reports of cold and blustery they determined care was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that are the care would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seven one last push to locate curl rangers claimed to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd\nAgain they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for review what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the house a J. O. S.\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of swore oh that's where our national monument and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of the body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than physician or the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the order was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never and thousands of reports\nSeen anything described in our national park service report of very weird and scary flight you guys\nYeah that's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there is no source for the older\n\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nSo I'm sure all of us have spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\n[noise] but uh again\nThis was her second hike into that area was she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no\nThere's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon tell me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know I'm going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents\nAnd I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine salmon Butte trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood and for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old\nShe said biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the ... the aisle radio music\nYou'll miss the iconic performance\nProud to the biggest draw\n\nOur must see I'd already a music festival sending us over seven and my job or a APN unseat him\nFox News radio when Chris posture FBI agents have spoken to a woman who claims Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party in college the bureau's looking into that accusation and the high school sexual assault clean by Christine Blasey Ford boxers Chad program at the Capitol reports were\nWaiting for the FBI to produce this report we don't know how long it's going to take now the agreement is seven days but at the FBI comes to the Senate and says it's going to take a little longer we're gonna have to do more thorough job here you can imagine that the Democrats and the Republicans would be happy\nAbout that but they say All right let's take the time the Democrats might be very happy about that frankly because you know the longer they can drag this out the worse it probably is for Brett Kavanaugh and\nHe denied the accusations there's new trade deal agreed to by the United states Mexico and Canada it's called the United states Mexico Canada agreement replaces NAFTA the north American free trade agreement in effect since Nineteen Ninety four Fox News reports\n\n[noise] we have you on the day in terms of exposing\nThe on ... all of the deep state all of their corruption Sean Hannity today and one one you saw ...

guy named Henry McCabe and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far almost the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis north side\nThis is a cost her ... missing people that I've written about in the past you had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue [noise]\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who is a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they laugh early on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and critically at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left the link the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nPut together some very interesting factual side notes\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances in your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you they goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know\nThis seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a\nMap I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go to Sam in national park yes I go that's quite a\nCoincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there\nI've got tons of disappearances in kings canyon and sequoia as well [noise] and when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that crashed in disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents that things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of ear disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a\nGrew up not far from off the field in Sunnyvale I grew up Cupertino and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps\nThat patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day\nWell in August sixteen Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out a treasure island\nThey held the world's fair there was a man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart\nThey start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the fur on islands [noise] and uh Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military and it was owned by good year\nAnd they took it because there was a a needed for patrol [noise] what\nBoth men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minutes to the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in a file and they couldn't explain why it was there [noise]\nAnd then it eleven Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were life preserver over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks\nThe radios in perfect condition no distress call\nFor funds been called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a coast guard ship that saw the blimp dip and dropped to wears on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd is it all pure fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and there's the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nTo find them more of us and I just logged on to go to ... am done\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing\nMean James ... today at noon at tombstone tactical right off the ice Seventeen between ... and Peoria for your last chance to win tickets to are sold only eighty talks with Newt Gingrich that's the day at noon a tombstone tactical with five fifty KFYI\nRandy your hand is just you know for\nYour next chance to win a thousand dollars is coming up to to use at the top of the hour on science y\nHigher here from ... in the valley for over Seventeen years social ... and get a hundred and forty dollars ... out of that will be anyone else with a guaranteed best cash back off calls ... two to eight five three nine zero for the Daschle ...\nFree and joins each tactical shooting range in Phoenix for the last day on Saturday I sold her ... any industry the\nManager sales writing on all ... and enter the rabble to win a free last year you stop by to learn what's lost her fiction is all about her new scenic facility is located on the northwest corner Scottsdale wrote and mail boulevard\n... to ... to let her see number two tactical dot com [noise]\nOn the next episode of that is right well we'll pod cast with Arianna Huffington vice president of ...

Anthony Fox News with empty seats Brett Kavanaugh still waiting to be confirmed or rejected by the Senate hurting\n[noise]\n\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone Dave pick up the story from there\n[noise] so the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch the flick that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nOf the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of that\nCoin raise area [noise] and nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that have the strangeness attached to it and like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that we are laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jackets they would have recovered the jak right because the\nThe area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the friend let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these uh locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year it was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington that turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot um cannot make public\nBut they uh they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulls me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it any asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\n\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone\nOr he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so you know he he has a\nVery broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so um\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to disappear if I could sing my teeth into that could relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study\nBut ethics seated before sometimes I think I I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies the bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to\nDraw tension to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation they use a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seeing there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and ah\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that's where it but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh\nIt it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm
