didn't tell us she went up room came back white face while she was right that when ... when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in hospital the doctor told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that that is one of those experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hard living under the

and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit\nBack eventually opt to the evening to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the\nMedication you're hallucinating or something like this person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition\nIs it oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my cold dead\nSo the Haitian was an ability to travel beyond the buddy traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are the people\nYou must

kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nCome and sit on my that is the backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubbing younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe are time travel in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other\nWill we traveled a parallel worlds for example but we're leading parallel live this isn't as weird as\nScience tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now I'm maybe radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in a dream in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solo consciousness survived physical death is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding and lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my include glued but loving family members are

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer\nAnd something drew me to him he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to a certain goal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on the day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so ...\nYou know what it how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking foot waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists are telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind and not to into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality is a dense consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages discoveries there's the phenomenon but used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the bodies sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts to something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high\nAnd there's another explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is though they're going to throw online\nYou living in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating the symptoms but he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know things\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel what the feeling in our body as well so that's a good story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell I'd give dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you and it could take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loosened dreaming you could call it shut many clues to dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state lose what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading marrow someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try lied state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like attend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally active premium the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look simplicity\nOutlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program on the method\nAll attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves

some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's in situations Joe in his dream life Oh yes he would do you own your own was inspired\nBy dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflections that he has interesting thoughts there'll be a day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship and science who is driven all his life by his dream well out of the stories in my new book mysterious reality is involved films passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of that is in the previous documentation is that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake ...\nWhich was called bowling get up to the nearby village is living in another bowling on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all the or death you felt absolutely confident in certain he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious around his Kobe all the ball and gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlives situation on actually give some insight into where how you'll miss mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books are you in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut to Rob it is crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself wrote a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this it gives the U.S and the ability to understand what happens to mind go consciousness off to death because it dreams as yoga understood we receive visitations from the prompted didn't dreams who made travel\nInto the realms where they are at home ... very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nBecame late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continue to live in other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dream maybe memories of ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... because it ... through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price of surviving that in coming back and adding his science\nAnd his scholarship to what he knew first and above deeper realities and giving us that incredible model of understanding with all the things we're talking about some of the great admirer of your\n... wasn't young soldiers who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had the disputes\nFreud regarded as his air ... young was\nJoining us Freud favorite apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although at tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his eye and writes who made himself is number one a study which is what you need to do to listen to to anything on dreams from someone who's not a dream of\nDespite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to apply to human streams\nAnd you had famously a dream in which he's in a house that is on many levels and in the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is uh the floor and bones and skills and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead\nAnd you didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into coffin of narrow understanding\nAnd that break up with very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversation with human Floyd approaching that pops up there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to\nAvoid stop so how scared and confused and and and and you wrote in describing that he felt something ... and his belly like a hot sun us and he was going to happen again\nThere's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing a pot\nSo what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the phone this phenomena ... which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us so it's a very interesting thing in my story about your ... your own says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion piece of all he's gone a long way since he died but they don't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers

available to you for example a place of healing and instruction and the negotiation in a realm the physical so the stories about experiences and that kind of reality which is no less real I Would argue but not physical well\nLet's take some calls here for you know let's go to a break in and Madison, Wisconsin welcome to the program brag go ahead\nOh charge um I was I'm thinking about talking about this topic uh several times with a several gas but I'm I'm I have a question about recurring\nDreams versus I'm very and hence streams um and whether they can either pattern or you just maybe ... remember them to occur several times so\nA in a nutshell um since I was little\nAnd I saw a um a something that would be near and dear to your uh uh thought George I'm I'm basically leading a bunch of people\nAcross the cornfield after basically I guess an E. M. P. mhm that was a kid so I wouldn't have known anything about this this wouldn't have made any that there are no cars that were ... we were what we were all looking up in the sky and seeing these\nSwarms uh uh I don't know like basically like a near earth orbit\nKind of battle for ... uh I don't know satellite battle or something like that\nAnd ... and we're all kind of downtrodden and I keep having the damn dream\nAnd like a cognitive dream you you saw the future\nOr maybe I Hope not [laughter] and you are not as well and then also and and I mean we're going to cross double a cornfield this more confident and um I and we're we have to make it north and I don't know what else from that I can give you and then also\nI'm I'm the one that keeps popping up is basically my own death which [laughter] which hopefully not but I'm\nI'm doing some work at my father's place in the north woods and I look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one big light in the middle for on each corner and I realize that I'm In trouble all of a sudden\nAnd as soon as I turned to run away\nUm I Know that I'm gonna get hit with\nI don't know mess or something like ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Roberts take on some of those rubber what do you think that many damn\nWell it's possible that you would dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest you sound as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary on the tea yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped it's perfectly possible that you had long range pretty cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nBut the dreams have a symbolic made up some ... symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the ... and seeing this may be this EMT\nPhysically possible for both people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an early stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not an absolute as this today but anyway leaving aside those are areas which would make me to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from the dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas\nDivide step from what from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back in the body and the bad\nI get it out of bed I go out in the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out in the street or out in the day to change things for the better and make healthy choices and to participate in the construction of reality we sometimes falafel\nDreams is just so powerful Robert aren't they might gosh there\nI'm dreaming of the way that we wake up this is one of my ... when I used to be my bumper sticker on my car when it had bumper stickers on my car I made\nI made one but the wake up and dream because for me dream you know fundamentally about what happens during sleep I valued sleep dreams highly including the ones you don't ... do not want that night show you exactly what you need to know\nAbout we can dream in other ways and wake up to the deeper reality in other ways waking sometimes without dreams but like sleepwalk is doing what other people tell us to do trying to fit in with their expectations trying to to fit in with our schedules and forgetting that there was a logical step is to all of this ...\nWeren't going to come back Robert in ... minutes and just take some final calls with you ...

today so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announced near it cost to production we predicted super would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible though\nShore in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silvery equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage given\nAll I can say is that some smart people like jeep\nIm Oregon has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nRoom one could that happen\nOver the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate about

[noise]\nJust a better way carnivores build everything back into my body [noise]\nHow do you know the real joys as opposed to being some some ...\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV about uh how magicians are fooling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate like really really bad and it looks like we're all doing trickery of some sort [noise] I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not\nYou should not ask the person who's receiving their reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that or why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test the legitimacy of what you are receiving\nA retailer on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers are others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician in and I told them I says hurry I got to tell you\nIf you're a magician and you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do to switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal ... I Believe he started out doing magic tricks has many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down frames and did you learn anything from that were you able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks that haven't started in years\n[laughter] to to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks that you're involved with magic\nI did a little magic when I was a kid um you know was a I was really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce\n[laughter] yes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical\nAnd you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and there there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking so restrictive and limiting into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interest or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be\nIn growing in a consciousness so that kind of a digging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month ... days\nTo have a birthday and a first name possible short they're asking about I'm a fellow man to a lot about love and romance\nAnd try to keep each call two minute nap for ... she came out as somebody\nWill cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation [noise] I don't see how it's not possible\nLike a ... ... excuse the pun ...\nNetworks beautifully on Richard hospital here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system says he'll this gentleman's heart perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit C.\nA.

I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that mother\nSo animals and that's your question tried to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a two wonderful dimension but I I don't want people to think that to aside that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... very sad\nIs don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have that ability to ...\n... is feeling the threat class and hit you a sense than your feeling that very intuitive so you can feel the presence or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you're with the press and who's not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I call psyche or\nVampires are but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of healing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... day in year and then I just didn't want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate choice\nSure that'll be grave however you're on a charge that\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris has ah been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you [laughter] to have happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much more than one\nOkay so ... ten sixteen so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity you have a question Chris\nOh I'm very much a creature routine and I just wanted to give their routines and our break his routine can get boring after a while\nYeah but you're in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\nI'm I'm ... I used to I I Do some writing now\nYes well you'd have Martin guard go at the time you were born and that tells me that you're you're extremely intuitive and you're very caught up details when you paint you shouldn't be painting again that's very therapeutic the press\nAnd that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well so you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough ... so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it did you have a question\nI Know that was there but thank you very much\nThan okay Thanks Chris Russia last yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know I sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say that to be something else so at that point you have to it's very
