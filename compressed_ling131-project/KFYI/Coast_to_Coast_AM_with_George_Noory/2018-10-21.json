when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat saying in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and in September twenty twelve you spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team\nIs the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini he's um how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that uh\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd like someone like you\nFor me you know right and they were having them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know he had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for\n'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer who take a picture and and ah you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to\nPull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah just writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems that makes sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right\nI thought it would you I just wanted to ask you about ... about a ... is there Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nWell I'll put an ad in just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because that an Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already got the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and then on putting the word for give an all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to ...\nWell that gets this letter and she really bond in writing the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit with surviving gap and sort of got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid all this I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication

with a series the other side of history I Believe a DVD sir\nYes yes he came to the exact same thing in this book was was in the middle of writing this back then are researching it always does I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so it wasn't\nA matter of if it was just a matter of one that had happened\nAnd so again or or did he let it happen did eat while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much for knowledge do you think\nHe had the actual attack\nIt's difficult to tell I Know they had at least a week's notice and you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor\nSo they were not at Pearl Harbor when the attack happened which is a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty necessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where are you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting so it was a pretty good evidence to support that the you know the same you know to support that conclusion\nLet's say they definitely had a as a matter of fact the\nHistory Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel\nThey even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find in the archives that suggest that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought wow hey look at that you know I mean I hate I knew I got it right but I didn't know how right I got it so that was where I was right on the money with the

Mussolini at first it was an ... Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that times are you the last um [noise] so America gets into the war and Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Burma and she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um I was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close\nEngland came to losing your island\nThey were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go in weight on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially with France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the bridge\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style one doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGather together but he he just pay the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time\nThat style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um church show like that for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to be homeless vowing only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was\nOf course you have to understand we weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been history but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure\nI mean there's ... there's still a communist newspaper too as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ... million\nThat you are it seemed to happen in reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like when he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and ... and Stalin had to pack\nWell Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such\nA delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd he'll or just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran\nI think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I think teachers Roosevelt still looks pretty robust\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up with a minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know ... ... documents were declassified and then you can really go back\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how are they tried to recruit Hemingway you\nAdd loudly so it was a fictitious found that didn't exist there was made it hard work basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country maybe our country into this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you\nKnow in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by stone stone is the puppet master the or he's this guy what he managed to accomplish\nWith his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the Bolshevik Revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party journals are used to call them\nUm red or was it calm hundred index card was Tacoma Ghraib we're used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one he knocked off every one of the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from one of those will come rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after someone's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\n...

the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced

how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is\nUltimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they wanted to wrap them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have been some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right in there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time and\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't\nExpecting it at all and muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nHe was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject\nAbout these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd the you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right behind\nHim up that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spirit you listen yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a and the find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that\nGot so much that they did\nTo bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best [noise]\nWell I'll put them down and just admit it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because back and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these stash in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his on putting the word for give an all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she really bond in writing the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul spirit with surviving gap and got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid all this I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got

get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens [noise]\nI think it was about [noise] a couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his ... eyes car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the with all the secret do three things that\nYou kind of breaking up on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James\nPike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry\nUm she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and so all of a sudden\nShe's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do these than it is and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through\nA Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes

back and forth a um because for many people this was such a new information and here we go again this time FDR and I expect\nA sort of a a similar reaction um these who murdered books I mean how how do people received them obviously you know people are they're they're flying off the the bookshelves people are buying them but do you get also some pushback because\nYou're you're this is kind of uncomfortable for some people you're you're pulling their their reality out from under them\n[noise] yeah I'm really I'm playing with people's normalcy by and they don't like it [laughter] you know people like it um\nYou know people always had the lead story we're told you know\nI'm only some of the story was first old but my aunt lives in holding won't want to show the vicar but um you know a lot of history has been saying oh you know and people don't like it when you investigate things and uh and what kind of overlook out from under him\nIn the cage so if I if\nI as I'm fascinated by history and I just ... ... what have you been out just because I have a you know I'm ... well the question was in our life history and at the table was\nSo I'd be very careful when I write the books not to fall in the confirmation bias\nPopulation by asking who I'm I'm finding just the fact that you want to grant you that sort of you and then it'd be\nVery careful not to fall into that because out of every four or five books that I start to look into all of a one might make it well the information that I bought it so it's not like I say well that's right although\nNot what the ... election that will go so\nFar right now in the case of FDR or you know this is this is Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of a century I mean was it or was it difficult at this stage in the game to to reopen this very very cold case\nThey're always difficult because I never want to know that there is a germ students read all of us like truth justice and our way and you don't want to think of anything sinister is going on behind your back and so so they're all they're all\nThey're all I just I just mean finding the documents I'm Sorry say again\nI I just mean finding the documents or uncovering the the the real facts of the case after all this time\nWell what I did as a I went to those adult mansion and ups the un parking or which was a terrific place we have to get a chance to go and spend an hour a day with a beautiful place in the rose about mansions around all her overhead is the national archives show I Want a tremendous amount of\nOn the last ... or ... when he told me is that what top secret previously\nAnd they're huge files there on the hour and a wife Eleanor and communism is that's where you are filing cabinet right in the middle or the animals fell over actually that and I want to Roosevelt\nAnd actually the town of those and she was being and gosh that'd be investigated for being a guy so you know who you will never had that information years ago you know so that's where the majority everyone promotional came from is from the original documents and I'm\nJoined up to be a user as far as robbing people the wrong way I think everybody Rob somebody wrong way for doing something you know I don't really even I mean listen [noise]\nRight well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes it stings [noise] um but you get the answers to say\nYou don't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in style in his Russia and the er the programs and the the the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about it someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nOr paint me I'm a ... a portrait of of a young FDR\n... you know I was a I always say it was about it which area below experiment well\nThis guy was born in week who\nYou know I mean is it they were just sitting in the old world well I mean there are groundwork hold them\nBut on the road is the Vanderbilt mansion you know they're on some basic parcel of land I mean to say that this guy was wealthy in and had every single thing with me which are ever desired was an understatement um you know they had every anyone people at nothing\nSo I'm ... ah you know it was ... was out around with not establish student um sees all the way through school\nOr you'd rather goof off and go play football and so forth and uh it was a well hey here's all was that I Want to use but he was a new something was really a ... is really something\nAnything that anyone was there

that are that forgot they're just not talking about it anymore if\nAll along you know he was ... year old man now he just talks on you\n[laughter] overall support was born and Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt by Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman got ready to change the monitor grammar and part of your life actually\n[laughter] no um\nNo I mean this is the evolution of this person\nShould at least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nI think it was the second week of\nRight and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what because that was just not the way but he was raised with a that Roosevelt was done anything to frighten people and if he was\nUm gotten early a bull all you have a special night comes out of ... so he did a lot of things without unsavory ban some self marrying\nThat's causing on funding in a\nNumber of rows of you know that name but it was awful lot of ways so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also a governor of New York classic now he ... he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through the history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd a young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um these sort of I I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy Taksim Kmart back in the er remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nBe what you really think on or five blocks which was a one

work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which are seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely um\nIt it's just a couple of 'em don't destroy
