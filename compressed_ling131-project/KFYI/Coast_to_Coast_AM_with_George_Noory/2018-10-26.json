programs starting with planted acts a story Linda the just just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and they people becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast than that a new ninth planet or planet X.\nWas indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the ... belt and the art cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shape residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and dust goes much further starting where the hype rebelled in and extend for three point to light years from earth\nIn a ... shape that surround our entire solar system including the ... belt\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at ... dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth\nMoving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and protests are brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Aaron ... out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math\nIs so great that it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the ... observatory in Hawaii defined planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update\nOn his search for this loose have planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying to mine\nAnd he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first\nJust in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than that distance from the earth to this\nSon though that is putting it in a spot that is something like ... times further than map can a good way out there but they have a narrow down okay\nSo that there were only going\nOn November first started another\nSurge because the new calculation Britain did that planet nine is core to a car elation that can only be seen by American I in the winter here now from the California Institute\nOf technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California\nIt struck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November the date when you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet now and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even see yeah\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no\nIt's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or anywhere inside of our solar system where Neptune and your aunts are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has all of this is just speculation\nCan probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any organ intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think

future and\nCan have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those theft estimates\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended that we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases\nCelebrating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the\nPoliticians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem a decade or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do when it's what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be a band that vote from the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as there's cities become habitable\nAnd that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get ... million of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nLot of the car she\nSuggested that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut it has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nTo global climate change in increasing more gas and we bring more wars\nYes you can go ... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen million\nFor at home may see sea level rise flooding over the Mac the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that um the forty eight continental US state\nFlorida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking persistent title flooding the researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue\nThat in more than one million properties in Florida well have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already one of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there\nIs it they get flooding constantly on full moon it constantly\nFlooding on high tides they get constantly flooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and Mary saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets at Miami nonsense\nThey've got to take the bull by

expected to happen to Florida\nOver the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster if Florida had water flooding\nLet's say three times faster than the

I've been trying to share some of them more serious flights as related to the issue of what might\nCome back into the dimensional exist and uh after a death that sort of an afterlife I Would like to share with you and our custody and an example of one of the many emails that I had been getting tonight\nAnd there is an indication\nThat the quality and the heart felt and the profound email that I had been receiving any various categories having to do with out of body or what the fog is and here I Want to read the\nGame is a few minutes ago listening to uncover because while writing this my father was very involved in a World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and buried on December seventh beforehand burial sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in the home for almost six years which I currently still on that you do not live there sorting out his items I was looking through the open door in the laundry area hallway adjacent back door\nI saw a very that thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up it went through the door\nI did mention it to my wife son daughter him close friend I Am an open minded conscious oriented person but didn't need it feeling was my dad showed me his spirit leaving the home for good\nI Would have never expected to see the gray color I wouldn't normally thought it would have had been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person\nI have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body conscious so left the house may have been more like the growth more earthly matter in its pure form I had never heard the word smoky fog until you offered them about the night\nAnd what it's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a ... cat that I lost a year ago and that that to the young one big hurry one that everybody loved chocolate and fluffy now\nI keep wondering that it had been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin\nWho passed about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it with her body they gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she had survive\nOn my mom and dad had been gone for a long time but you never know because I really do think\nThat the body smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photograph or that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension\nTrying to come and get my attention and they YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered the charge\nNo I haven't heard something like that but the ... these are magnificent stories in emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people who have had similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on and you can't\nYou cannot rule out the fact that it's real yeah ...\nAnd the profound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may and one of my uh end of November coast I think it's going to be\nWith at least two of the people who have had childhood uh separating body and that's the question is it the very soul that leaves the body how could that be\nIf it is not the sole that needs to animate the container organic body what part is it that is moving out from the body in out of body travel\nAnd there are all kinds of explanation in ancient Egypt Egypt about there being nine parts to the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western world\nAnd it probably is the most important part of us and when you go back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences\nI have never told a single human being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six do remember an out of body because that is significant\nWhere was the learning there was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous training of the soul in a new body container\nWould you buy I sent you an email I think you've got to make sure you follow up for this virus or you know children\nYeah the polio or something like the polio in November I Will so I probably it'll be related to out of body ease incredibly profound testimonies a and that is a from this ban and there's a whole bunch more I can see that I'm\nGetting tonight they keep rolling in

the second loop the video is October Seventeen look at them look at this strange extraordinary thing twice that has come to the office\nI have not felt anything negative I Do think that people who

I was eating them or to twenty Kim [noise]\nUm matter of fact he took care of first car tonight at twelve twenty two I'm from pat in Seattle you up at the time um my watch quit working about two weeks you know ... to ... um if I glance over at the ... you know time and it'll be ...\n[laughter] I Know my dad's birthday was to twenty two as well\n... yeah ... I broke my hip in July and I was putting them to twenty two um [noise] it's just amazing\nKeeps popping up all over for you\nYeah at least one dropped my you know minor be on the clock on again I'm playing my high scorer on an even number\nJonathan how do we explain this how do you explain this to people who are non believers in all of us who\nMight say oh you just tap ... what do you say to them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that but I often start with\nI happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists in the infinite realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is\nHow do you know that would question the question and often that stop someone because one can take a\nBook with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there\nTo your to your brain\nJohn do you believe in God\nI Believe in a higher power I Believe in a higher wisdom I Believe in a higher form of energy the I find that there's no other explanation for all of us\nWho are you angry with that higher power when this happened\nYou know George I'm I wasn't and\nI really have had a hard time getting angry I have found the most comfort in accepting the flow if you will that has come my way\nAnd my hope is and my sense is that this flow has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details for but if I go with it rather than fight it it makes my day is a lot easier\nWhat message would you have for somebody drawn who's going through the same thing you went through\n[noise] the message I Would say would be when it gets really really dark that's where you find something that's really really light\nAnd it sounds like you have devoted your lifestyle to this mission of getting the word out about what happened to rouse the dangers of some of these medicines and of course what's on the other side don't stop pouring\nI'd I don't intend to I'm I'm definitely devoted to communicating what happened to him but at a higher humanistic level they're\nGeorge there are a lot of people that have a lot of pain and in that pain my message to people is there's a lot of light you just have to look for it\nOr John thanks for getting the best job John's book of course just called in for needle twenty to his Web site infant needle twenty two dot com linked up for you that's coast to coast they um dot com up next investigative reporter Linda ... joins us with stories of high strange this\n... website is now conveniently optimized for mobile devices if you're a coup students ... you can listen to live in his shoes right on your boom just lose it goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android browsers [noise]\nAccounts [noise] we are those valleys talk station is used ... five fifty why Phoenix Y.

years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast than that a new ninth planet or planet X.\nWas indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the art cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shape residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto\nTo about fifty astronomical unit from our son and the crowd of mostly ice and dust goes much further starting where the hype rebelled in and extend for three point to light years from earth\nAnd the fear of shape that surround our entire solar system including the ... belt\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at my your files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth\nMoving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our ship be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote\nIt is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math\nIs so great that it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side\nOf planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the ... observatory in Hawaii defined planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update\nOn his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying\nTo find and he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able\nTo visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than that distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune\nOh good way out there but they had a narrow down okay\nSo yeah there were only going\nOn November first started another\nSurge because that new calculation Britain that planet nine quarter to a car elation that can only be seen by American I in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena\nCalifornia it\nStruck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the consolation is up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November the date when you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky once once we find planet now and looking at it in the infrared to study it will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbation an even keel seeing the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even see yeah\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look at it will be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets\nSometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where my does have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... when we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how it got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a ... tune like planet just a little bit less massive than Neptune and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAny that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly you're it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the or clout\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nProject with the scientists that I had no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive that we're trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury aside and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and you're on a star because Pluto or been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity and that it\nIt would have impact on every single thing and\nThat's when we I would've loved those Zacharias itching to have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a face\nTo face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do that for conversation end of it 'cause it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat ... even if\nShe doesn't agree on some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be a massive plan it but when you read like say about the ... through scholar I did that transition that we're a car and\nDon and you look at the carvings but one thing that always is\nConfusing to me
