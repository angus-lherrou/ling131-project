the respiratory virus that was out last year called de sixty eight really hit children very hard and put a lot of mental hospital and they noticed an association between severe respiratory infection

I wrote a book about the twilight zone then in subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in addictive phone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly\nDictated most of his scripts and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nIt's just off the charge I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never swept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it he smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted Amos just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did he meant you said that broad wrote to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories\nOf soldiers they do is that's\nA hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides twice on the night gallery\nStay with us decorative and take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with him about a about the twilight zone at the ... with us his book is called rod Serling his life's work and imagination\nAlways on your phone then you'll be happy to know the coast website is now optimized for mobile users just point your iPhone or Android Browser to coast to coast am dot com and enjoy\nIt depends whether or not the king or the crown prince knew about it if they knew about it that would be bad\nStale President Trump says the world is rushing to judgment and when it comes to whether the Saudis killed journalists Jamal ... secretary of state Mike Palmdale met with the Saudi royal family yesterday they were going to conduct a thorough\nBurn investigation\nThey made a commitment to hold a anyone\nA senior officer official\nAccountability compounds on his way to turkey for meeting there and the Dodgers beat the brewers two to one in ... the national league series now tied up at two games apiece net gain just ending moments ago this is\nFascinating [noise]\nHe's off year fun work environment and we use my dad's service tickets so no handwriting but the most important thing you get a ghetto was the pride of knowing you're on the team that does things the right way not the easy way to do and you also get a brand new truck was built in navigation get all is the company you want to work for and I get all their conditioning technician is who you want to hire\nGo to get all dot com\nIt's time to get healthy it's time to get in shape because the doctor was in the house KFYI house it is your fitness ... and his new times that are least three to four pm on my soupy KFYI\nFor over a three generation family owned and operated with Bill Adkins\nFall ...

working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one will probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or\nYou know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collection of short stories ... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a rebuke to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS\nAll access and the interesting thing about that is they launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with the new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how\nYou know how classic these shows are that can be re Andrew reintroduced to uh you know a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod Serling one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling\nA coke credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of\nYou know the crop circles and you know we only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff but he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular ah documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said there are so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance\nWrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know relive his youth and go back to a easier less stressful life will be the uh it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be as kind of a companion piece to to distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring them to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body elects\nTo ... for just Ninety nine dollars the cardio dot com and they are the I hate Don ... take unlimited Katie's morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio ... in your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars border you are today the party a dot com K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nThat will come back then it varies you with us rod Serling his life working imagination ticket for a rod Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\nWell I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time that wraps around his writing obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he is certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he he would hate reality television a cap on the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time\nA rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life uh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show it in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did it television you know it would be difficult to get that kind of a\nPerson like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition that uh you know there'll be there'll be a good kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know help them you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and there was certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it\nNowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\n... let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you're talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was watering\nFor Nick if he knew how many cameras used during the actual shoots okay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question but I Will absolutely agree with that that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time\nBut of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more\nA relatively modest a set\nAnd uh so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make the actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the Boulder or\nYou know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he went to one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to\nBe Robert Redford yay yay has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good and that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton jumps and actually that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson\nOr the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spit out the person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because ah the everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered have\nTo say and the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one and uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to be you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and ...\nThis is what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can all get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally released years later and I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half\nHour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh yeah it's a horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course horrible\nHorrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seems like it was very a scape is more than maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that my second question would be about\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist than\nYou would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally or you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and it's really amazing that that you can't really find somebody saying a bad word about Russia\nCertainly do you really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're going to come back with final phone calls with you a special guest Nick ... book of course is called rod

starting man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes is hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming home from Italy crashes in the desert\nThe catheter that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and up Bob coming it's just happened to be walking by and seen this newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we lived experience even though he didn't fly that nation you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and ... when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes and so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time the word and twenty five ... crashed you know struggling with those shows that ... did\nHe had a time machine you know one of them this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to alter events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed you know at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that\nSo I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany they're already thought he could alter that event\nOf course but a man I don't know we had to be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney claim the er Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine [laughter]\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was through a man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything\nHe went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bags to all of a sudden became full of gifts and did it uh you know and pecans man he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy that ran a department store they found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes in here and goes where did you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out\nTo the police station and the department store owner came in there and so yeah there it is there's the merchandise call well you're the Bob ...\nYou know and the guy's name was Mr Armstrong right and\nAnd they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but it can't it right and\nSo they had to go of course store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratch it it can recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released oil Santa Claus he raised the bag and grab the wine Nineteen thirty three and edited to Mr Gandhi\n\nAnd got it on the wine and they walked outside and they think Santa Claus flying overhead and play with reindeer\nOh and it was ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans that remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in the twilight zone feature film as well about a a old old folks home where\nA ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and and the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and\nAnd that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I I've got to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart of it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the living room with us those are great times ...\nGreat memories yeah yeah it was a different time and you know for all of us and uh yeah it's great to ... TV can bring you back that way and you know so it's yeah it's great to think about\nLife was different too sure it sure was yeah yeah absolutely as a kid that didn't have a cure in the world ...\n... and that's what are you know that that's something that Russia was was yearning for in a lot of us well it's supposed to be able to go back to being a kid and have a being carefree and being in a sense and and a lot of stress and everything else and that came out and in so many stories\nHey and welcome back to coast to coast great show for you coming up here waned ... with us a noted expert in the areas of American furniture folk art\nPaintings glass pottery collectibles but there's more to the story then by the way he has a broad experience in American and European antiques he's the founding president of the wood very antique Dealers Association past president of the ... brewery lions clubs for more than Twenty years\nWayne has maintained a busy antique appraisal business serving trust attorneys insurance agencies homeowners indeed appraisal services Wayne welcome to the program looking forward to this\nThank you it's going to be a blast I got to tell you my my lead uncle ought to Boston years ago\nRecommended to John F.

children apparently around it\nMay it may be a because the the respiratory virus that was out last year called de sixty eight really hit children very hard and put a lot of mental hospital and they noticed an association between severe respiratory infections and children and uh the acute flash of paralysis\nSo it's usually a you have to watch out for is that about a week or so after an acute

with us or is on the board of directors of the rod Serling memorial foundation a charitable organization dedicated to preserving and promoting rod Serling legacy\nHe's a former staffer writer and editor for good\nTimes magazine in Long Island he's also a musician and vocalist back in two thousand ten is former band or react released the CD with the ... inspired the title between light in shadow on the ... records and his latest as his book called the rod Serling his life's work\nAnd I imagine nation and Nicholas I got to tell you I'm looking forward to this\nFact that George I thank you very much for having me in a thank you for that very nice in the introduction\nOf rod Serling was an absolute genius was any\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again a he was\nJust unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great great shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends ... I wrote a book about the twilight zone in his subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in addictive phone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his scripts and\nAnd honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could\nTwenty five year old they're not getting a Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something is strange something is you know not quite right\nAnd it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good\nYou know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we have what's called the after dark newsletter in Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I've got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nUh what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script you know a rod wrote Ninety two hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes of five seats that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just if you know and and\nAt the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter] he smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was\nHe was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got back in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally a demand you said that brought the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total

A. R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nThat will come back to that greasy with us rod Serling his life working imagination ticket for a rod Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms renting obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think you would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for\nSure he he would hate reality TV or on the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life uh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show it in the normal you know regular everyday person then\nYou know a trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it's kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the show or you know I thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would have but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television to knock a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows where you gone back\nOr even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him\nHe was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about a major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWith rod say about all the different channels available though in his day there was just the three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it\nNowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIs amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series was in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the SATs which to me was as far as the visual impact was which was a testament to the you know the semi talk for the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish always wondering for Nick if he knew how many cameras but it used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget you know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the effort\nThe time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set and uh so and he did he got the most out of\nOut of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place on ... and one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to me you know actors one room and that's it\nAnd he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like ... of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he went to one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to\nBe Robert Redford yay yay has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on TV [noise] uh and that was a great great show when he was a very good and that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's\nCalled the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was uh the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else looked like you know that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can all get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally released years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas dealer\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all an hour long as opposed to the half hour I'll rarely yeah okay yeah\nAnd miniature was one of the hour long episodes and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know a special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA is yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very a scape fist were then maybe someone stay back in the sexism just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well uh\nWhen his career started to think a little bit uh he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it about where it somewhat in a little cemetery called uh enter lake and write on a lake you must love that area in its wife or when they first got married they had their honeymoon there a\nOn a lake a her ... her relatives parents probably\nOn their property and he bought it eventually and they live there and they always went back there on a summer to uh write and relax and uh but uh a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion for uh\nPeople hey no an area like a shoe store or whatever might be a store\nI mean it's kind of cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everyone ... already rich really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or where local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist than you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters written signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody
