am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nUh ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... a year and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and ours [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in a league group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know and I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a\nTerrific how men but you know she's\nA she's a frequent guest here and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff a ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked to she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what is the science these days on something\nLike that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and few huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nOf frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I get in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality\nOut for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years a Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into the wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I like the ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my faith very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in the book\nThat I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we'll go with the next pitch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list [noise] next on coast to coast am\nI

reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of at all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nThat one yet none nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait\nWe're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we need to do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless

was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial\nIntelligence and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it is and now that of all that one day a artificial intelligence robot\nHoward by

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho has a trouble walking or they lost their ability to walk in the spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah that that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's there's actually\nA movement called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that they usable a trend human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside I mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground\nAnd he'd lost both arms to the vet them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we're mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have right\nNow these are these are arms that he can move with his car that they're they're wired to mine\nAnd I to me than fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you name it even in even in a military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there you know where you know write it get it get it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what a fifty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella go with them to take some of that load off their own yell at them but I think that the\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robo cop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah\nFrom the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free\nIs that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead\nTo what this technology is pointing to [noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing fold acumen soldiers abilities but I think are\nEqually realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I put 'em in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff known are using their own\n... says it's just a fancy way of saying these are\nRobot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not shoot another were to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if\nWe give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nSo right yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know yeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but\nWe can are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would\nPropose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to ... to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses\nBut but positive for sitting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end in how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden

woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words

I'm like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur since then ... now into my\nQuestion before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about is how big the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah but yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] and how they're I think you question you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about it if you're if you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a\nSerious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse or some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of\n... of a mental a question or a medical experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human

and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten or this is such a great privilege\nIt if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three of the Monell the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots with the Bible\nAnd polluting the Korean the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the new this and the new ... the the current New Testament yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and ... even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel chubby rural because a historical\nValue of the book uh Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they would you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much in the future as he is he did\nBut that that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this\nHas done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we stray\nAway from that and people and and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll\nUs called in and you know ... it's called proof texting and it's a yeah it's there's a\nThere's an old saying I've I've said it before I go to ... but it's one of the first things I learned in seminary was that some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just it sounds like you're a learned guy but I did a I'm\nA I was writing I wrote an article about um about a true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do what\nI found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill\nBut actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that\nYeah I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why do you uh from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God\nAnd I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter] I'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ...\nYou know people go way far under their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I draw the line you can join the conversation the rink and you've got a great town I'll let you get back to work too but um last time I was in a Bowling Green actually they were doing work I was on my way to the\nAirport in Nashville and I came across it well you do a Charles in Portland, Oregon coast to coast Charles\nHere and good morning how are you today\nGood it's open lines you can't get anywhere\nWell let me first start by saying uh I've also been with or just like read from the coast because to have ... days and uh you are my absolute favorite uh uh they Bert are bell second\nBench ... bench warmer I'm okay with that [laughter] I mean nobody can replace it man but you know I get that anybody to wind up on it\nOr George George isn't a great job I'm having a good time or where do you want to take as\nA just a what'd you make a difference between murdering show that's fascinating that could be an aunt that lives with me for a week in on the Internet\nIsn't it just ... and the fact that it's Islam or they say murder the Jesus was murdered\nYeah that's I think it really is I don't know um go ahead\nWell I yeah I wanted to take us back to the Bible um I was telling the screener I'm a a for lack of a better term hardcore atheist and everything but uh I Believe\nThem in you know seeing\nWisdom where you find it I I yeah or a whole lot of wisdom in the Bible when\nIf you read it but I think uh\nI I don't be much value but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago um it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you\nActually go back and look for you know the Gardner heat and you're going to be disappointed but if you look at it is\nYou know what separates humans from the animal knowledge of good and evil how to spell for blacks and yeah and how how people we're dealing with that that fundamental truth back then and um you know they were putting their own poetry behind it but they were saying this is what separates humans from animal and how\nYou know how do you\nBalance good meat but once you understand it you know a cougar doesn't\nUnderstand good and evil want to eat something you know it it it only does what it does and in animal does what it does and thankfully but as soon as yourself ... collective your human\nYeah and it's really interesting yeah I think this is\nAnd I ... I you know I I I probably had friends there's a lot a lot of people I Know who go to church to hide from God because they really they think like a roof over their head in a church is something that ... it's like a like a like a screen like\nAnd the and it never succeed creating a pool atmosphere\nInterested in it as a good a civility\nI totally like totally and completely accepted as a possibility diverting idea Tom let me go to Wal who's in Pennsylvania on coast to coast am on a wildcard line before the bottom of the hour wall\nBlow pig skin it's nice to talk to your wife [laughter] I think you\nWhy I thought I wanted to say something we're about to board up at you started talking about the Bible and uh I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I shuttles them subsequently become an atheist agnostic gotten not so I don't know what to say that you really\n[laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that way but it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's a space I live in I live in a space during the week so that kinda bleeds throughout the year I'm afraid\nAnd your shirt or something when you said that job\nYou know people come out of church and they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because\nI Can't possibly believing in God that show hypocrite or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other God's up you know in the Bible up you know I can I possibly believe in Jehovah when he chose children by the thousands while you're talking about Schober\nWhere he sent the age of ... first born Egypt change or the great flood or Saddam ... more around ... innocent children killed there so I mean like\nYeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative as being the defining story\nSo I accept what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so\nYou know everybody puts their faith in something\nLet me just put it that way well everybody puts their faith in something [noise] but you pay the money put your face in sex\nBut your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make you happy\nAnd some people put their faith and having the perfect body or or that they that they're going to have the perfect career and that's how they build the structure of their life around that that's really what their God little she becomes [noise] and that's\nPerfectly fine I mean that's freedom people will do that I don't see anything wrong with that [noise] it's just not how I Choose to do it and then we'll just leave it there so\nHalf hour hey gosh darn it we're almost done we could open lines coming up next the coast to coast am this is the ...

I'm more in line with like Quakers\nI'm fascinated with the idea of um the beginning of an age when they've got to be occurring age began if there's disagreement about\nThat as well yeah ours is that because\nThey're throwing I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're ...

and that's why Michael Guillen will point joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can

thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me\nThere there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nUh ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spend a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... a year and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked him a lot\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in a league group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing a terrific come in and you know she's\nA she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and where she talks\nShe tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it you know she's great and you'd really like her in this very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this would also be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in\nThe few huh [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here you're my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise]\nUm I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are really in a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality\nOut for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an export into the wisdom and Buddhism and ... or Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it and so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system\nIs I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next ditch the plastic studies so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list [noise]

author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryer and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and\nThat is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're drawing a traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of thing and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits in suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we've got to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're\nFighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we didn't do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know and but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right or we have a a a a juicy or peach or something that people do buy\nSlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about [noise] and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he\nRecently applied to the\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robot Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because he did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that the you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ...\nYou write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly the managing\nEditor who are like that the cushy Murphy up yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose\nA yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how easy it was at the right now I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendship [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile and people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to the thought was Michael ...
