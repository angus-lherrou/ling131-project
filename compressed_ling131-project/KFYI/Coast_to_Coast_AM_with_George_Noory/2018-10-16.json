[noise]\nAnd um I could hardly see the players when they the map started England played Scotland but I heard the match in my headphones and then suddenly I hear that Gary McAllister who is the this

because why it was quite surprised and actually shocked that scope and sold me the island that I could buy the island\nBecause it's a it mirrors not listen to this it mirrors the great pyramids of

which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already [laughter]\nYou know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City and the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nAh their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith ... and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group to the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today match yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had this fear of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking at this dark places\nBut they were doing it with the sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism with in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science what we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nComments at us and believe it or not with a member of the original group and he talked about

we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control message we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it\nBecause once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these are things you want with\nAll your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think\nJust expressed gratitude and most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express things that is a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a\n... a small number of things that coalesce around one name has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is

the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that I offered to the coast family\nOr things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something\nThat I hadn't experimented with myself\nWell you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI

A. R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nThen we'll come back to the coast to coast George story with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down a goal in and going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal it really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it\nSomething will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goals that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus\nIs the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\n[noise] interesting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your own\nDough all on my own you know this is really my tribute to the uh thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself a you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are striving for all of us who are experimenter as\nWe are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles story that I've heard about was a financial miracle when I had a friend in New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading of the book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nIn God and loved though yeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five\nDays on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss who said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friends that are that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents his old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\n... ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's exactly what the experience and it was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of hacked needs to say never give up with these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take and twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\n... absolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all enter this wonderful drowsy but still conscious and Congress and state just before we fall asleep at night\nAn act in image in your mind enact a scene of something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen
