us his book the forest age if I were on the line mosques elite Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build and it's based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a new chemical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred than two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my pod cast about it I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with uh\nI I always transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou can have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack\nLook that yeah that\nMay that may propagate through our systems maybe much ... much more brittle much more imbedded they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that were very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion the laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time in space up his face up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business than ten percent cost ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before until we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave a technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by\nThe millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary ah yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it has a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a T ... or carrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of his killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries\nOr call one eight five five nine for nine radio that's one aide Cy Cy nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n\nI'll come back we're and Reese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do\nWe really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make if you do that job there's a word for that that's called the humanizing mhm\nBecause if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor a machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in and we only need you to be a machine that that we had been to\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine young machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are\nWe able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever if you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be this ... billion people are going to use it what do you think there's going to do their jobs you could have seen all the jobs that were going to bed and she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise] um\nYou wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you wouldn't see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody\nEvery time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know they use spell a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nDo you have a special order you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nThen we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do with a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so\nWell correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nUm people aren't gonna you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm\nNot like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with\nPhysical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these by ... which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain because there's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brave they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we've used it\nBecause for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so big and knew that it just changed their productivity\nAnd ... and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was a language that this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city

working alongside with technology\nI loved that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up to ... just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education

... you know within the organization that thing in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the

I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could they interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this\nLike there in the closet they are afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell they talk about their experiences because so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is gone through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd the mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because I you know when this started happening to me\nAnd I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit of that medium ship just you know some of the things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um

this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is going to work with\nThat are saying\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think

Adam and Eve away from God to actually get scratched\nOut of the book of life and so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off in parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line\nOn is when this can happen again it's just a theory\nIt's a pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it are bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight\nSo I think it's you know people are are these bright lights and I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do to duplicate that experience yeah yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could what you could\n[noise] um it was um oh ... let me just tell them so I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George like All right I'll tell them we have a couple of minutes oh\nIs it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry you know when you say you've got to tell us\nOh yes so I yeah so I I so how how 'bout you just tell everybody incentive is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me in one night and said I saw\nThat man again and and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what\nHe said tell her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad who was not very nice and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my extent that but I think it was the ... man who knows\nI Would say a lot about a lot of people there to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge\nI completely understand and I am also I've become fearless\nThe photography all ... ... it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes photography and um and uh and storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event it's the it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff that happened on the photography was you\nKnow a little scary at first because I it's weird it's it's it's weird there's no doubt\nYou know the subject matter is more you are these random ...\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has passed um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the book um but other than that I don't recognize a single one I've had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of them look like the Eighteen hundreds dorm\nThey do\nDo yeah no I I don't know who is all of them are there is some of it\nAnd um you know I feel like I've got a few that looked like they had a rough time the last time\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd broke her back to coast to

made my life so incredibly interesting er and I think fund a really good word for it\nWhat is done for you Julie knowing what you know knew about the other side\n[noise] um I have found a tremendous amount of peace\nI Know that there was more than what you see with your ... and I think it actually\nIt you know it it actually doesn't bring me chaos it brings me peace um there's a lot more at work you know there's a lot more work like this story you know from the four oh five but I think is so\nI'm profound about that is\nAll the coordination collaboration that had happened on the other side in order for me to still be alive\nYou know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen and believe\nToo not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe is actually her sister who was holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guys or their spirits are there ... somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone all\nWith the you know chance that I Would hear and listen that's pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side\nDramatic yeah it is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people doing that used to listen\nDon't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe in the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I think it makes the world really small and I think it and I think it also probably leads to live depression and a lot of abuse\nLet's go to those who are you ready for some calls\nI Am so ready for the call\nOr

fourth age\nIf I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is a machine and your mind is a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred than two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about a I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure they're introducing an element of like it may turn on his ah\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good is it ... it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems may be much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible grows on this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nOr even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that for a very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up space up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods it it can if if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business than ... percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before until we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave a technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it has a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniffer gunpowder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we are going to make a ton of mass killings systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are that have significant military budget sitter spending good money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so\nOr call one eight five five nine for nine radio that twenty five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n\nReese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called the humanizing mhm\nBecause if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor a machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that there'll be invented\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine young machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as high unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years of the jobs vanish\nAnd so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are\nWe able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity\nSo what ever is if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it's a one back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future you know there's going to sweat thing ...\nBillion people are gonna use it what do you think it was going to do the jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages on the newspapers\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs are going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you\nKnow tons of programming that you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many\nThings it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we had this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots they can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nWell the correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm\nNot like you said that oh you know yet I'm\nIn that today and that's a big yeah because one day at the progression we're going\nWe're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but somebody your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of bars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we've used it to overcome scarcity\nBecause for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for his anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize in I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got two technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nUh you invented the nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world a giants ... emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that um\nThat\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what's gonna what's that\nTo do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're ...\nYou're right that's the only official intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all\nNot at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and uh you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen\nHe's a world the Dow originally the big powerhouses or they're you know sometimes the new technology comes along and they just don't adopt a blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see that you mentioned them and I'm\nA poet should story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on earth right blockbuster another one\nExactly what's going to drones agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and and you know where where did search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is gonna be laws it's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't up because uh that's very real\nWalking on a boat\nYou know I I kind of\nHope so I don't know that I Would say blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like because you can just list um\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or anything to record a psychiatrist or anything to record a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the permission industry then yeah\nIt was just there was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the
