took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult to Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus for ...\nIs a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter in\nIn the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um is going to be missed\n... if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy Facebook\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you gotta have the ads you got to have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top\nUh they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during a as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers no financial information nothing like that law that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting a demotion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place\nUm and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go where experimenting with other things\nAnd I mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of Google puff\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head\nUsing of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf was probably not a good idea and the first place that's a time\nAt ... at the end at the time well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that norm is growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going

question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before to lump in the ... cycle ... he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nThink Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown\nSeconds before the picture is ...\nYears ago during the television days that they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they'd show videotapes of various anchor people and the the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that that type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research in that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at like ... which is this ability for the mind that\nMatter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes in fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one in the rose again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant trait basically in a single moment\nThat we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event that\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything\nElse with his mind now there are some who said dollars trickery its magic but do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate be taught in cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending\nParties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\nKeller back then and there are many people who have suggested that this is real um\n\n\nI'll come back more over with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour works in the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up George this is a really really important one because if if there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond Lucy nation perhaps it gave the into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes but I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence\nTo me the most compelling pieces of evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known as\n... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have their in cardiac arrest there were ... and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct it's down and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThe seeds and nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals butts they're out there is that a little bit what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut Kenneth Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist and I materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on just thing regarding and the ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing you ... you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically a I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nFact chemically the brain\nAnd therefore they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical leave the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches going back to psych made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain or does it affect the conscious is The Mind's a dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book imagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire\nFirefighters show up a very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness\nDamage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I talk about the studies done at the university\nOf Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified my medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so\nIt's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly what's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for\nA ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise] I tell the comment was set and they live actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nAsia for a boss and some building ... to find that very UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in a was ball and I believe he was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get ... who like dealt with over there mhm\nMy question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that it's just ... with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something where the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has argues outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world on allergy it's\nLike somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept

then see the drillers calm\nAnd drill right to that same ... a debt\nAnd there it is ... and ... you\nKnow again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nAnd then can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and I've seen that with three

the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field of physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere is a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one\nYou affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness\nNow I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nThere are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just ...\nI tell everybody to use them in their home advisors they total solution to any type of war you would ever want to do around your house and

the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the role of the you know the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic trench medium for as far back as she can remember\nChoose communicated with the ... the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who's studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which obsessed with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control the gift of the huge or Fifteen she served as the medium for adult CEO says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company to group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to the point of Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYes ah I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter] tell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is\nUm she's known as you know the high priest is a Salem and seal off and when I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed and her her job and very regal looking very um you know she's ... big presents\nFor a person and ... at\nThe time did people welcomed with open arms you did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a\nGreat question see you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms\nBut let's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seem to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of these and then it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the stability what\nYear are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's\nInteresting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just that you know she told my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in the matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that he is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nReading for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so\nIt's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the others that you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true so she was very unique that what she said\nSo that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nNow you've been with the New England it goes project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to keep them busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing ongoing set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would\nFocus on but it's a team of individual that you know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really\nYou know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go bumper the night you know someone else doesn't really want to to want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to do I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and there are just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of fear it off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] terrified as birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says\nWe have done more than a hundred and investigations on I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers and know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on on if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well isn't good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and they live\nWhat have you concluded about what this may

your life was in danger\nOr ... or did\nNot by the by the levy yeah\nAnd I first book a ghost chronicles is ... is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation it was a daytime investigations jumped him and call me up and asked me to check out his house so I get ... up and we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... uh and the the kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nUh one of ... separate me from the other one and the other one talked to my rain we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wasn't marine comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's one that's left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nOr it varies on on on the particular case uh\nThe you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people but more of a piece of equipment a\nSmall case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance\nIf you have reports of a ... and being seen you might bring more video equipment or you know like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound the ... something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nA I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah I work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public go sons and that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around them and you and say use windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and it was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my field and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the law the side of the wall and you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself and she came and then they didn't want her to miss anything so I I just thought they waited for a night I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited\nAnd waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the the rock out there and there was another one by the ... inches of snow this there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough that CBO patient is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so it's\nThat was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public a ghost town on uh what island lighthouse and benefit pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was on the\nUm renovation at that time we were ...\nAnd in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen they search dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their cars on the\nYeah yeah the the was it\nWas about so I jumped up meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman as she says why would you see that's just

to run\nA Ron How ya doing she never touched me in the morning\nThere you go [laughter] so how often do you get to calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we ... it was quite common but there are so many group so like when I first started I always say there was\nA twenty ... you have to do was news like twenty four in the country knows like twenty four and any city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael is just an image though of the ... the center and now has scarlet ... I don't know if you've seen that\nYet or no I haven't seen that yeah it has a ... it's pretty that's you're already is our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring that thing down from four to nothing\nThat would be good [laughter]\nI think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of ... area you might want to concentrate your audio because if\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour of the crime is for like a robot or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for a strictly investigate\nThat the popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you to hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of the earth and been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that ghost outta there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know they basically uh you know what you expect from us in a in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls free both to view let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nAlright thank you for taking my call her thing\nAnd I had a question and I had a really really rough year after year I'd probably the worst year of my life and and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see here\nNext I mean you're being a lot better hopefully he's starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yet what um okay\nSo Brandi I did pull a couple of ... um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but\nYou know and the other kind of poll is you know this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right though because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that you can get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's time for you to grow and you have to be able to to try that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying I'm ... but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day we came to really try and you put it on the math but you're not feeling it is that\nCorrect or no [noise] uh right [laughter] yeah okay right\nSo put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person feels like a lot of people when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to someone else is there\nYeah yeah\nOkay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay um\nMany is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough in is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it feel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding imbalance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron in marine the these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] ... [laughter] it doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think while it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there\nUm and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now I think Ron let's say it's probably isn't constantly\nMaureen what do you think of ... boards\n[laughter] funny you bring that up um you know\nI think that they're a tool I don't think there's something to be afraid of them I just think it's at the intention that you use when you're using that means ... so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the ... and that's probably not a good idea um because you're not\nReally open and you're not protecting yourself and um we had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using a lead you board and I believe she lives on\nHaving you know getting high at the time or whatever she was doing 'em and she invited to the er an end and her how her whole life rather went into chaos her home and burnt down a she pretty much lost everything\nAnd we were actually called in an investigation on a different home she lives in she was now losing that home um so\nI don't know what do you think about it wrong\nYou know a a a a bite parish priest called in and asked me that same question what do you think about ... boards\nI says I've got a collection of the the games [laughter]\nUh and uh I Do I have a collection of all different ones for use those most good parent how confess the kid is too [laughter] but ah not go down to one too I always say though if you're not comfortable doing anything don't do it because you don't trust you got\nRight next something let's go to Matthew in Illinois first time caller he mapped go ahead\nOh I didn't want to George either um there are some of the show\nLike you boy my dear oh I work at a nursing home okay\nAnd uh you know anything about nursing homes\nOh you see everything there\nI don't see everything but I have had a occurrence with one at one point um I work night shift and I was walking in one of the law the areas where there was nobody around but as a chessboard\nAnd\nI walked in one day and the board was completely you know a reset up there was one oh I went up to it you know just in money and I I I had to buy them yeah I\nOne of the places I carry with our at was a um a building called the mall that building and here in downtown LA it's pretty old building it's one of those buildings that kind of at the time you architecture and all that stuff\nBut um it's you know definitely ...

Roche you're a forward to the ...\nOh yeah definitely a yeah go way back he he was always been my mentor when I first went into goes type thing I Would on the Web site on the Web which was new and that was the ... village so that's a since then we've become really good friend\nThat oh I think if people who are spirits and what their experience and I don't take that away from him but I Believe that the eggs that zeroes into wars and the Jews to nine or sometime interfere with and we see will we see we feel we've field and things move they move but this is my question\nMark question in all the tragedy\nThat don't happen on this planet\nAnd and that's not excluding things have happened right here in this country if\nThe protocol the goals would be because you have had tragedies\nOr are in your life it took away your life then there will be more goes on this planet then it will be people\nAnd just let's just deal with the United states itself I mean I I Am part Cherokee and so I'm just saying the tragedy happened in them and all the people Jews all over the world what is the protocol to be a goal and if you believe in their\n... if it's not the matrix\nOr could you ever consider this being the matrix and the numbers you just not\nCalculating if it's the way it should be that is my question thank you for your journey or music or their George I love all your new all the way from bluegrass dude sold to everything from the years you've been playing your number one when it comes to that\nAll right my friend more to come so what what what is the definition Ron oh what a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nYou know it's the sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian\nEnvy honestly we really don't know exactly what a ghost is I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks and we had a cause of religious aspects of it\nAnd we come up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the the purgatory thing not like it's a punishment but rather it's a place it's a temporal thing versus the and the thing so I mean that's just going on doing their\nTime basically but that's I mean that's the only one theory there are many three she is the tragedy thing is one I always worried about\nIn Gettysburg was always supposed to be the most part it then that's why it's the most thing but there are there are battles I mean Nagasaki and you I mean thousands of people will tell like that why are we seeing like all those goes from running around so there's got to be certain aspects of that we were unaware of or or have yet to\nDetermine and uh and and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly\nFor sure we are but there is and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are\nThey all kinds of evil [laughter]\nWell well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel which are uh you know spirit guide me on the coast to maybe\nWhile I ... I guess it depends on what a definition of the ghost might be I mean if somebody sees their dead grandmother at the side of the bed is that a ghost or is that there's some kind of entity your spirit or or one of the same\nLevel I always say that number one citing is is what I Believe is a messenger goes that's somebody who is just passed away and they they come back to see how you're doing or let them know let you know that they're okay I mean it happened to my mom my mom didn't believe in goes or anything my dad died at a\nCompany I mean it family cookout never got to say goodbye that night uh she was in bed and she swears he came in but we dressed in a suit she scared the crap and she screamed and he disappeared but\nThere are countless examples of that uh throughout history\nLet's go to shade in billings Montana first time caller squeeze shaded and go ahead and she doesn't\nHave the going George great thank you\nA question uh last night you're talking about spirit guide a little bit and it really piqued my interest in about night my interest is peak once again I'm actually had a question for Maureen sure\nUm I've had numerous people throughout my life come up to me and told me there's something all the way\nSorting White House efforts to project an image of stability you with the loss of one of the highest profile women in the administration at a time when women's votes are being vigorously pursued by the White House doctor John Curtis online columnist on Tom with us\nJohn this was kind of a shocker wasn't it\nWell I mean it's a shocker in the sense that everybody thought that Hillary was a you know so and ... I mean she was a strongly high profile um um you went in ... in part because she was a you know governor of his state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the uh you know the Trump\nYou know kind of foreign policy in line to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs investments for\nWell I mean not only was she would this administration she was with the Bush administration ...\nYou know she started off in turning with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of a bunker Trump I think you can really\nUh uh uh ... uh diminish or discount the idea that that uh evocative Trump is going to take this position\nAnd she said she's not going to\nKnow and she's not a dog but I think if they can can could Joel or you know twist Dina Paulos arm to take this it would be far better than mark Grinnell here's the current ambassador to Germany this girl is God\nYou know she's got all electricity about her and I I mean to wind up managing partner at Goldman Sachs without a bachelor's degree in finance she's I mean how do you do what George how did these people\nWhy you know I I Know it's crazy but let me ask you this John because I Know you've been a staunch supporter of this administration have you ever seen more up ... in two years with members of the cabinet or his own staff\nNow I think it's pretty safe to say that ... there's the turnover rate here is a you know a unprecedented on the other hand you know you want people in there who are you know better and brighter type folks I think Haley was an outstanding you went in ...\nAh and I think she just had enough of it I think that you know that's a really tough job especially today and you're just button heads all the time sir\nI think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that she might even run against Trump but you know this is just absolutely hogwash\nBut likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean she completely back you know the Trump White house and with a ... wouldn't mind seeing him as a you know another four years\nSo she runs in twenty four on her own could be\nAll right John thanks Dr John Curtis rising use of antidepressants turning our waters folks and do a drug you soup and harming marine life according to experts\nPeople ... example in Britain used more antidepressants than almost every other country in the western world but the drugs can cause havoc in the natural world after they pass on to the body the person taking them\n... it's just a disaster gotta be careful\nGoogle Plus I don't use it but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private down there from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consulting Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus from silver plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um this is going to be missed\nWas if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story for going on for ages though with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his\nBook [noise] so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you got to have the sponsored poster God I have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on but ... says everything was social media scale is everything at Google just never really\nThat scale now this brief that occurred well all the right at the top of the currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently the reason they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that while the stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up with her so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of fat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient the kind of a rationale for setting a demotion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place\nUm and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go where experimenting with other things\nAnd I mentioned that there the Google commercial version of cocoa puff\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the uh this is the systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using ... that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially ah and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf was probably about a good idea and the first place\nThat's a time at ... at the end at the time\nWell it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear snapped jabs going broke who do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a walloped yeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been I go to go there you know kind of\nMessages to the troops the kind of try to cheer them up [noise] uh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nA that's you know that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly you know you you can live off the ball and you as you could really a fall flat later on whether or not snapshot steps that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now that they're not they're certainly not the uh the star of of the moment like there were some time ago\nPoint thanks Lorna appreciate it up next an end to upside

peers say in your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise you some\n[noise] it's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think at like hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up at the pre cognition tell like as a cycle couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nThink Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they'd show videotapes of various anchor people and ... the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or one again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study used this random number generators these machines that spit out zeroes and ones in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is ask people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once in a zero again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nAnd they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in people people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those may or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which is what an offshoot of the ... study where the machine the random number generators\nWelcome back Marc ... with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour works in the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates shows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel\nOr whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up George this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond Lucy nation perhaps they give them into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest ever started hated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stops after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the defender later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct gets down and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories are but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for\nExample the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see\nWhat they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with your mate totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality though I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational ... than a materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ... uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil I Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing your lab already know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically a I liked it\nShorter question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications free during the ... or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\nBack chemically the brain and their work they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain through these medications or even aspirin\nOr Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches the going back to cite made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious mind's a dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus\nConnected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill\nAnd this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we\nCan't automatically concluded that one causes the other so here's the simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [laughter]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up a very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver\nWhich similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I talk about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly what's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and yeah I have a question for your gas sure how\nI thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise] I told comment was set up but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nIs I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get ... who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being researched widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there's certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nI'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole show what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's
