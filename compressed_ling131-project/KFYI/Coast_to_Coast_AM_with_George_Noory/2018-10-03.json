I. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first of the four horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nAre the ice caps melting or not\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that one renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent\nOf renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies\nSay that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution I'll\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nNow a a all modern landfills and in Europe in the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants your old down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible and man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are\nAre they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they caused the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there are causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nWhat's to come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand well with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under there you have to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream Muslim slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make you\nStill don't think whoa okay go ahead John\nYeah but in the army who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're\nWe're talking about when ... when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I think he out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was up by plenty more ... booth\nLame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas while we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost ... can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor\nAuthentic spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think\nWe should warn are good friends she not to make the same mistake that these climate game hopes there's a are using a ...

that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA\nUh their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm\nRight now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but this ... used to be a big court or a big uh port on in in a\nNorthwest Italy an excuse to be a port\nAs well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us ... go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and done what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the war\nByrd climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and they no doubt this a lot of ...\nHarp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but\nThere is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone\nDirectly into California and they're being blocked and it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricanes they can stall hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex which have in our with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new Luskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell is it going man just did it exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay oh engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show talking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people have so much heck shoes were hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want or against it they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know and that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of the climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing is gripping the oil industry all nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sits over here with her sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play the oh I can now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the green box folks that's

room with an old friend\nYou have my friend just as a I'm looking forward to this you got to tell us about this a young age encounter with ... what happened\nWell I'd never had an encounter with big foot uh my first ah\nA realization of the character came with uh the Patty film probably somewhere in the late sixties early seventies and um I've had other encounters in my life but not with the ah the hairy men\nAnd after I saw that I said to myself oh my God this type of thing is roaming around North America\nAnd ah unlike other people who thought it was a hoax and still do to this day\nI was a I was sold on it from the beginning I just said to myself this thing is real it's out there and ah these fellows or have seen it and got in on film\nYou know I'm convinced people William are seeing something very strange and unusual they're not making up these stories some things out there and there's something on a creature\nI have no doubt about it George and are based on um the encounters into testimonies if you think about it what would make a husband and wife sell the home that day love if they hadn't had something that scare them off the land exact\nUh what makes a hunter\nCell is gun collection and vowed that he'll never enter into the woods again\nThey're having encountered a something in the forest uh to me is everybody a lying is everybody out of their mind I don't think so I think these people are having real uh encounters a in most cases they've been frightened half out of their wits\nAnd a ... as far as everybody else is concerned everything's a hoax right from the get go\nWell will come up with a number of different theories on what we all think big foot might be we'll take calls next hour I'm going to ask you this because I was raised Catholic what is it a Catholic blogger where do you do\n[noise] well basically I uh talk about the things that I Believe a troubling mankind and uh try to get to the bottom\nOf the heart of the matter if you will um [noise] uh the things that plague us you know the things that are troubling people in life and living and marriage and\nAnd work and uh try to expose these proves to the individuals by using my blog\nAnd I I don't ...\nI'm a ... you know I'm not on the blog every day I kind of blog is ... and to\nDo so and I'm I'm getting some good feedback from it you know people seem to enjoy it and

the coast to coast you know I've been in and inside for a long time well thank you and\nI'm when I'm at my desk at work I have a little I bought\nAnd one of my abs is coast and what is he listening to [laughter] exactly\nYou know people are always are getting your near what is that what are you listening to over there and ah I I tell them so I tried to promote the show as much as I can\nLet's think he is a tough being a blogger a religion and spirituality and also a believer that there's a creature out there we all called big foot\nNo not at all to me um as as far as a big foot goes as far as you of phones go as far as angels go you can\nPick the topic um\nI Believe all of these things for me for the both of my faith\nYou look at the universe is just a vast and wonder is thing\nAnd ah even our own planet continues to amazing baffle us with the discovery is being made day in and day out\nAnd if you just think about something like the dinosaurs for a moment or if it wasn't for one guy who is out there looking around and places where your normal person does not seeing a bone hanging out of a hillside\nMhm we wouldn't really know about them but we know from even books like Michael ... book forbid knock allergy there have been a\nPeople of civilizations or animal life here will be for us and yet when given the account biblical you from Adam and Eve on wood so to me it's a test of faith uh what you believe what I'm giving you from this point forward in spite of knowing what we were going to discover after the fact\nSpeaking of books I got from you too volumes of books just on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me you're originals\nWell here's what happened in Georgia in this kind of humorous I'm One of your producer had contacted me uh I had an order in four foot they're actually made to order on Amazon and I had given all of the copies out I had and I had what\nI mean I I had it in order and fruit punch bowl [laughter] and I said I have nothing to send George fell I said I\nCould make up some copies a and put them in folders and send them out there and she said oh that'll be fine\nOn as I was telling Tom tonight and I said Tom oh my God I think I think bill sent me his original book before he's got it wrong [laughter]\nNo no have I have no fear have no fear\nIt's done it and want to send it back\nNow no that's okay and as a matter of fact uh probably within the next few days I'll have some and I'm going to send them out to you and the a and the crew to ah pass around and ah enjoy them\nWhat is your instincts tell you based on your war that big foot might be because this is what I hear I hear it could be an extraterrestrial it could be physical creature it could be an ape it could be dimensional we hear all kinds of things what do you think\n[noise] well [noise] uh [noise] my my own personal theories are on that or to fold a number one in the physical realm\nThis is a creation this is a creature that's out there uh how many of them all day you know we don't know nobody knows\nBut based on the fact that they leave print from both the hands in the feet a according to some testimonies they bleed having been shot a and they die as well and getting into a little later on a which to me makes\nThem a living breathing entity like any other creature a B the greater small on the planet a I have\nNo doubt whatsoever in my heart any

back to coast to coast we're here with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on is\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and think keep to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree\nIt went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it and\nWent to climb down he couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this\nThing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it low was gone again well moments later\nHe sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so we had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think given in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something and play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved down to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story\nA involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd you're Ninety percent of it is uninhabited\nSo when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state [noise]\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine uh the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven well\nAs it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tools\nThe wife is saying the husband was to shovel whiz the rate was this so finally the husband get the idea that they're going to ... to get the oil or the tools they have do an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife pulled the bistro table on the patio and they were using them for plotting plants\nAnd\nSooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by\nAnd now these hands spades withdrawn they had actually called the police report in depth on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber could understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods they found one of the shovel leaning on a tree and the wife scope doubt nine feet off the ground one of the one hand garden\nTrial with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to the out they got a right I guess an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush just thing it was buried in the tree several inches thick couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods and showed the cop shoveling the ... everybody was baffled by you know this turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\nWell\nI had a long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guardian behind the house had been trampled down there were huge footprint in the bed or tomatoes were taking the head of lettuce one mash and whatever had done this which was obviously a big but\nI kept right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just kept right over the wire\nWent and had it's full of feed and then left they recall the uh the police over the what had happened that what transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had report periodically of people saying they show these big ... creatures coming in their property of walking now\nSo it isn't convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being Eighteen then not being\nTalked about which is a very odd thing you know you don't you

in North America\nI don't believe so although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of cold to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of this this knowledge of the things botanical and they formed this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was on familiar with [noise]\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea and did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they talked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the\nGlobe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh uh a dirty little ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast you know a a\nWe'll tune in because we're hearing things that we can't get in Oklahoma City she's nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos in big encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one night I'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held the nest so s a using branches in ... and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nA now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area right night for the hike but when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear\nHe had a pair of military grade night vision\nOr by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance of light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know a battery operated lantern but then they realize that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fish and which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believed there were a buck Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey can see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but\nIt was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming eating the trees around it\nSo that the parents to know who was that bright yeah\nI mean it's it it it's a glowing light ... around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow a bubble through want\nAs a child care\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise] and what blew the mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self\nAnd yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they still want to see a big foot appearing in this secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separates from the orb and now you have like this power of blue and white light with this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately it was then that they said the bluish\nWhite light that were surrounding the big foot starts to dissipate where now the creature was left standing in the light of the circular all up\nAnd then they said it started to move at that point they got out of dodge\nRely on the trail can't blame them yeah I Can't blame\nThe broke camp and while they were breaking down the tents and everything just to get out of the place looking up on the mountain they saw that the orb which they had originally seen was back to ... around in the woods or which got their attention initially and water\nTo this big foot they had no idea and nor did they get through you know go shake hands with it so it's very very bizarre and yet you're talking to you know\nSeven scouts you know for boys three men you know a ... I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talked about would knocking that the people are sharing what's going on with that what's that Saddam

warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\n[noise] sure well that's a ... this is a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nOr and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit\nUm if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice and have fallen off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that one renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent\nOf renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution I'll\nIt's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes on now they are all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep\nA a rats another room and out of the way um our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants your old down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worse fate\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bizarre as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of age cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are\nAre they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there are causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the and the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky\nOr is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their job\nTo call during the day after tomorrow is\nBased on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian or the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so um there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nWasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make you\nStill doing the whole thing well okay go ahead John yeah\nBut in ... who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're\nTalking about wind bills when I when I was living\nIn Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind feels that they had and I could see out in the meal that they had a big fat and there was plenty more boy\nBlue flame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas while we're asking now why go to put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do\n... you know electricity now come back and they said no no no it's going to cost to my kid have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be born in ... methane gas now I Want to go why has there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise] ah they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having stepmom You're welcome to spoken to him several times are hurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that\nAccuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are\nAre are using a ... I Believe me I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion\nThat was the year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a robbery or a young child then oh\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the frosty has told us is that's just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive rally improved airlines they're doing All right it was out as this last world which a lot of them are are telling
