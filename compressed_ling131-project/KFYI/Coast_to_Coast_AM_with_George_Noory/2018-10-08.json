trivia here Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first it originated with the ancient Celtic festival of some pain when people would light bonfires and were costumes to ward off ghosts\nAnd the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween is an interesting Josh\n[noise] yeah it absolutely is I mean that it goes back thousands of years and um I I think fouling was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time when of\nCourse they were\nYou know reaping the rewards of harvest but preparing for the cold dead month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time that there was a period where the the bill was so thin in fact the Europeans often talk about what they call Finn places the boundary with so thin between where we are and where the spirits are that we could encounter each other\nFor at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other and the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then there were also all of these creepy evil being to come through and so you'd you'd wear a\nMask so do you blend in with the evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us\nYou know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when a here in our part of the world the earth is shifting away from the sun\nAnd so uh that means not only does it get colder and darker as we built in to that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things that might otherwise have been sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a eyes shine a flashlight\nAt towards you outside on a bright sunny day well you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it\nOn a dark night right and so what happens in general but it's still there but it's still there\nIt's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is the time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with these spirits another ... these are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also in Hampton this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for it more\nLet's take some calls here with Josh as we continue chatty and I want to ask you about Robert ... to ... in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles\nGo ahead you're with us no\nHe's not let's give John and Virginia Beach Virginia try hey John go ahead\nOh gosh I wouldn't tell a story that after they back in the nineties\nYou know I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however that Nineteen leaders middle nineties I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little showed his point of their check\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I just said you know any way I ah I went I was late getting as so I had sit in the back treacherous and services going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the pushing the check\nAnd I looked up and it was my uncle had just passed away\nAnd and he told me he said\nJohn ... your car and I wish I was shot at it and what to do and then again you said John don't value car\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone but\nStill I was you know I knew something\nAnd so I got her at home with a friend of mine and the next morning I called my cousin which was the son and it passed away\nAnd they ask you a tape it and then bringing my car to get him back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his go and get my car and took over the cage for them that anyway he a guy in my car when they pull that that ... ... and they were hit\nBy a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know injured hurt I mean they had ... votes and all that\nBut I never told anybody there is a I was really a lot to say anything that it would it till two of my close friends and um I don't let it right now I'm not that I have a show and they have\nThe I guess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know what I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nBut you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they would be and you get my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a time I ever had to think like a ... you get all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks who among us right now who where are you know the astrophysicist the cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police and so when you are a spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little\nMinute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on but once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm that person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now the\nFuture to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of enhanced to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see but the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over my definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation\nAnd see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Roberts a haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because\nHe still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and ah I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses\nAnd bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this call here and you know\nRobert was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people\nWho were going to see him now\nWho are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've got the information coming up with a Saturday Los Angeles event at his

Hoff or log in\nAnd I'm cleaning and I'm often it's called the day room you know where the ... people come they do that to this and all of a sudden I say this little nine year old boy I Would say\nMaybe ten alec home I cooked indirectly straight you know just that ... perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start my office and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October\nIs that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves or and he\nWasn't supposed to be there or was he\nI don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they\nEveryone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people that they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because of the full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know full history\nOf the hospital where do you think Josh\n[noise] for Kyle thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world and the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold when when they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nYou go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that reminds you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something goes fleece boots\nIn creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nInterests don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time of celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest and bolts go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't\nInterested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now [laughter]\nI Love it is kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell I after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher\nAnd initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to ... go stories with\nYou know tales of sacred in cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there is there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought\nOr the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right\nA history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details\nSo I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn\nOh we're accustomed to less than was and you know he's convinced that haunted to Gettysburg Reno was haunted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting is it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\n... there there are a lot of theories about why\nThe battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um [noise] and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over\nSo that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole\nSkeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nUse their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications a seemed to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father in the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures\nAre these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff immediately ... ah recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there\nAnd they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dens battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough

his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest hunted in World War two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities Pearl Harbor is it haunted or not\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that wants to UFO track them for miles I think almost a about an hour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles was\nA a retail store of those yeah that's\nAn amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two\n[noise] and aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found it very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was ... a professor\nAt occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what he witnessed was a huge object that was pretty much just standing at it sitting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean\nThat these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nIn and they shot against the nephew people could hear ... sounds yeah and we're hitting something\nThis this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from 'em and\nHad a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew Swain with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book Matthew\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about uh after World War two if you had these battleships\nYou had a aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us\nA lot of people got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow creature around the the carrier\nUSS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented\nA ship base a haunted sites uh there there\nIs a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there um and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book\nSo yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seem to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to\nWhen we hear these tragedies to maybe hope\nThat that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew sway and we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of euro haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew I'm Adolf Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the cold did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I I came away with a a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold\nOr you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life but what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there'll people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too\nBut it sounds like Hitler's early a philosophy was are influenced by\nA cult groups like the full society in the real society very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area but what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal fears but more of an incredible\nSociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power\nA worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power and so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a code groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the coal played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so there were the wiccan in England who uh try to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime they held um meetings and the ... got together\nWith the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch Horwitz\nYes ah the allied a new thought ... a movement those a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved and to try and use spiritual techniques a cult techniques\nTo stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so those were\nA different ways that ah ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lot of people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I tried to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is\nThat I'm really when I started writing hot rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah and ah\nYou know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special coal power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising toll ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cold or maybe a you know actually can kind of

about Jim Morrison that stand out to me as as the real strange ones and ah the one that I I seem to always go back to is to the Mexican restaurant that had a bathroom a that once served as the vocal booth for um the doors when they used to a record there\nThey sing in the bathroom well it would have been vocal in\nThat and then they turned it into a bathroom but uh you know their stories about uh the bathroom shaking violently when people are in it that it almost breeds and\nPeople the owners thought it was haunted by Jim Morrison and you know later I find these ghost stories about Jim Morrison literally all over the country I ... at his childhood home in Arlington\nAt a childhood home in New Mexico uh\nBarney's ... uh in uh California all of those places have this reputation of of being haunted by Jim Morrison so so that's another kind of a baffling like why does one figure not just inspired goes story but inspires doesn't I could put Elvis in that as\nWell and I had the two remaining doors on the program a few years ago Robbie Krieger and rape in direct result raises gone now which is Robbie Krieger but yeah I got I I Love talking to them about about everything music

burden is only apart from federal offensive if the president prepares you for federal offense you could still be nailed by a state court a gamble versus the United states could count the sort of multiple prosecution of double jeopardy and make it illegal\nSo the gamble case could random or a power the president currently does not have the power to grant an absolute burden a burden that applies oppose the federal and state level this extended pardoning power could be very useful with members of the Trump team\nLike Paul Manafort or Michael Cohen and if the president decides to pardon himself it could protect them from prosecution for the tax Dodgers associated with the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in New York Times reported on Tuesday the Trump received under the table from\nMany Democrats here that if he is cornered pardoning himself this is exactly what Trump will do and if he's challenged he has a court to in his favor by two judges who owe him a favor Neil

with Dr Gary right now we're hearing what about the flu season this year what do you think\nWell the flu season this year you and I am but in discussing the new flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the ... flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us than a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions\nYou look on the flipside twelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth the confusion gets even worse when um\nThe vaccine last year was only thirty four percent effective and now they've come out with a Lebanon flu vaccines on the market and the CDC has picked up the shop gun and\nFired away too many hey use any one of these vaccines I don't like that do you oh no not at all because your drugstore may be offering a vaccine would should be the

as a potential uh twenty twenty presidential candidate but I think one of the things that they tried to turn this into\nWas that we want to really investigate his drinking behavior in high school and in college and this is where they could they have an an impeachable offense where you know nobody is interested\nIn his drinking behavior they were making an allegation of sexual assault if there was no corroborating evidence even among the witnesses chi man\nAnd this is over and Susan Collins gauge bury a it was at the end comprehensive\nExplanation of why she voted for him because if the presumptive the presumption of innocence it's in our constitution gr innocent until proven guilty they have no proof\nThis pass John\n[noise] no it won't ... this particular issue will house but the bitterness and the rancor between\nThe two party system will not pass you know looking at a government that is at loggerheads\nThere's almost nothing on which they can agree and I think that we we

stumbled into a time warp for several months ago did you\n[noise] I did in fact I broke\nThis story on coast to coast am shooting them before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology on going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that plays turned out to be ...\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um I I I\nSort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make a the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military if your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with\nEver we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving us better to be\nSafe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be few tile I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien ah theorists talk about\nTalk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to in slave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for\nUs to commit to global suicide in other words\nAgain I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other\nAs we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un you know what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people who are banding together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep [noise]\nI mean there is something to this idea\nThat we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some uh beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against and they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver\nAnything that we can do and so once we see the possible examples like I'm perhaps preventing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George ... with you again I'm going to give you a little Halloween trivia here Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first it originated with the ancient Celtic festival of some pain when people would light bonfires and were costumes to ward off ghosts\nAnd the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween there's an interesting Josh\n[noise] yeah it absolutely is I mean that it goes back thousands of years\nAnd um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time when of course\nThey were ... you know reaping the rewards of harvest but preparing for the coal bid month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time that there was a period where the the bill\nWas so thin in fact the Europeans often talk about what they call Finn places the boundary with so thin between where we are and where the spirits are that we could encounter each other for at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other\nAnd the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then there were also all of these creepy evil being sticking through and so you'd you'd wear a mask so do you blend in with the evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us\nYou know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when\nA here in our part of the world the earth is shifting away from the sun and so uh that means not only does it get colder and darker as we tilt into that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as\nA strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things\nThat might otherwise have been sort of brown doubt and the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a eyes shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day\nWhile you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night right and so what happens in general\nBut it's still there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with the spirits another ... that these are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also ... in Hampton this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for a more\nTake some calls here what's your Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert Hunter dome in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles go ahead\nYou're with us no\nHe's not let's give John and Virginia Beach Virginia try John go ahead\nAt your age ... or I won't tell you the story that after they back in the nineties\nNow I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however ... Nineteen years middle nineties uh I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little little selfish blank check\nAnd I wasn't that close to the way but I just said yeah anyway I ah I went I was late getting as so I had sit in the back or the treacherous act and the service is going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the push you a check\nAnd I looked up and it was my uncle\nHad just passed away and and he told me he said John ... your car\nAnd I wish I was shot at it and what to do and then again he said John don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up\nLate and what he was gone\nBut still I Wish I knew showing\nAnd so I got it right on our friend of mine and next morning I called my cousin which was the man it passed away and ask him if he wouldn't mind being in my car to get him back home he shouldn't matter though\nSo he and his go and get my car and that the medication for them that anyway he uh\nHe looked at my home and they pull that it should be talking but anyway my truck and they they won't kill but they were extremely you know injured hurt I mean they had ... moves in mind that but\nI never told anybody this at was we let you say anything that it would it till two of my close friends and um I don't let it\nGreat and not what the show and they have the\nI guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the warning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know what I didn't want to go out and he told me down and\nBut you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no they didn't have any idea\nThey engage in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that\nWas a ... that's the only time I had to think like a safe stage ghost you get the same thing as folk then they're saying\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the path the president and the future all happening at once the ...\nProblem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are a spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of enhanced to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over my\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because he still does ... yeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert\nI think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses\nAnd bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know\nRomney was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people\nWho were going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in part\nIt's almost like Marie idioms on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare it to the Meridian of energy the flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and wouldn't that electricity manifest and ... in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy\nAround western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these ball of white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJosh ...

go ahead\n[noise] right so I I just got off work at eleven thirty ... and I was in the ... and the Katie Hoff or log in\nAnd I'm cleaning it on ... it's called the day room you know where the site people come they do their activities and all of a sudden I say this will nine year old boy I Would say\nMaybe ten eloquently I cooked steamed directly straight you know just that ... perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to\nReally show theirselves or and he wasn't supposed to be there was ...\nI don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell\nOr maybe two or three people they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh\nOr what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHow do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf Illinois in ... where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere most places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you drag your socks on the carpet and touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating a luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nYou go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you\nFind that there are these\nVery strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that reminds you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks in\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest and bolts ghost lowering the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural ... with us a couple of months ago with Richard Sayre and talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nNot on Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now [laughter]\nI Love it is kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books\nSo I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple go stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two where these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in the world war two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there is there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought a the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm\nHistory serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details\nSo I think those are two reasons why the the stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield ah that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had a friend who just went to the little big corn\nOh we're accustomed to less than was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was haunted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly\nAnd they just still hang around what what's going on there\n... there there are a lot of theories about\nWhy battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these\nUm almost in the event almost in beds itself in\nTime and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ... now on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that you know\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole\nSkeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't ... stories\nEspecially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff immediately ... ah recognize these uniforms is German uniforms and later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there\nAnd they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dens battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany\nFor a an airfield during World War two we are with them I Believe I'm\nA somewhat a flight mechanics for the for the ... or or yeah so definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern\nI get from like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber\nTo a pretty peculiar in and there have been other what they call ghost plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that you yeah what you want to do a different time warp or something right in\nThe reason I looked into the these are a ghost points stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for the morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were\nStarting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... you make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nAre the handles hundreds or
