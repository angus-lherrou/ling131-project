there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction miles\nYou're talking about uh the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately yeah and of course you know a subsequent generations Tyler do grow into a world where I've never known any different you know I'm right\nThey have is a night you know before the Internet age will remember that um that was not that sort of a worldwide surveillance that we have now and um\nYou know I think that's one of the unfortunate things for future generations it's gonna be a child a normal thing full of them and and probably accepted as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways been in effect they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things so that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what he lived alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually they facial publication guy he's the first to November but people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which May Day classified through the faith in the information act in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that wave yes it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWind up present paper with the guy to showing how falls that they put together now I start the book actually with the contract a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to pay for for the would go so to speak but um\nGovernment agencies do uh put together falls on paper planes have had I mean ... for example just about all of the contact Hayes of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George found hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on the one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm In ... by the FBI but yes like ... ... ...\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government government's very different two hours and bordering on ...\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George fans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape papal now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when John full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange life in the sky and then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these way of dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger didn't show save\nExperiments now what's particularly striking is that I found a file in the British national archive and it revolved around him and I run a wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the moaning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to below ...\nAnd they the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they said they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing is that they\nThey ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal air force I sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the ... talks about how the they ... they promised and security services interviewed Ronald wild man of by this encounter with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of\nSounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction low in today's world that Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO calmed down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together but has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking\nSort of with the music meant well there were there were a interesting colorful\nSort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realized that the government is\nReally does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they conclude the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going round people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that that sold him huge fake is gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and a damn ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about\nHow the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments um the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn ... um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination tangle\nUm but in showing that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many people associate with cafeteria to ice shows\nI'll tell you what they were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you know it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experience is unusual states have consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so [noise] yeah\nIt is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of how my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know there's something new a new direction by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how it sort of antibiotics scientific ideas and let\n'em have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and even after like ... and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of ... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remained strong or you may increase\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess would be called spiritual beliefs they pretty high numbers in America I'm believing and goes to believe in spirit\nTo believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and trying to think well where where people getting these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter or dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time to recharge it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um\nI Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\nSome for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm also a\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world and I find I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they buy incorporating an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nWould change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for my dad used to get the recognition they deserve their role influencing pop culture and public

a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing at his place\nToo many people have come to believe that life doesn't amount to much there are several people who are\nProfiled in the book who struggle with is the uh apparent contradiction between spirituality and science I'm ready to get into a couple of the examples and how they got through it here in just a

is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who have struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he and his wife is is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality hit an incumbent interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes to Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he he embraces map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nScientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to\nThink about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see see I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a\nKind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen or does that happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's ... how do you how does that fit into this\nThat you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter sex um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer a wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about time flipped from and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise]\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what climate is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that blocked prior we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defending future's all those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene or he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices um info on\n'em so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLifted itself up above our three dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension that dreaming stuff he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and ... and I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about the science is a showman remote viewers\nOut some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away six listen to the break [noise]\n\nNow you can get show updates and connect with other ... fans would you joined the ...

them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us in pull us up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as being that come down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and I'm an avid book a ... so\nYeah people are definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher realms or or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as I was kind of the higher dimensional object but then on top entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal leaps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also\nHave scientists in the book as well and from skeptics so I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of these events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments in fighter and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences and so on\nAnd and that

details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice you'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that

I may not be I mean\nThat relates to big foot on the bottom level snowman for example one of the more intriguing theories is that they say of the Himalayas the Aaron\nI'm of China and possibly big thoughts may be a survivor relics of a giant type that didn't exist or write about two hundred thousand years ago called John ... because I mean they'd actually roam around India\nTo backs on China's so they're all there is a good chance that what we're seeing with those animals could be surviving pockets\nOf drug ... now we don't know granted\nIf big votes um you know falls into that category because we don't really know how ... you know did he was like a gorilla ordered it walk upright like us you know that would give us the answers but we don't have enough skeletal\nMaterial to my that sort of determination but to you know I think the the idea of extinctions that might actually not be extinct could actually uh applied to a number of these so called trip to says that cold\nAnd then you get into some real weird ones and ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures though yeah maybe ... that were reported long ago are now being recorded as ETs or aliens and it\nUm and like the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several\nReports of people saying the fans have black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black ducks fan and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then what literally gum the next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things oh you know ... not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of\nDogs but once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirit of that dogs would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain to the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there well now you write\nIn fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there\nAre these large black cats roaming around the U. K. which simply defy explanation because they share a number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every now for that many reports to exist\nYou know that must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is if by a flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomenon thinks that's the case\nYou know what we're going

remember reporting lizard man as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding in seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland far Iceland\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for paranormal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they'll be coming out his window areas where it seems every fit in each brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had same this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods a at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... it in that respect than there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of the name and spoke to the local police so I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like the dog man and a defined to black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nAnd and share rates and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say I mean if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have on says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the movie\nWhich I don't believe it day by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you call that gold bats watch and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people are like one and this was back\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington\nAnd I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm your man I'm Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of Harry as well [noise] excuse me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut the sort of the ... all the hair and go combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of the place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nWell I've got to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing five books now I'm On this phenomena foreign the men in black and one of the women and black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say I'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins why why why I'm I'm people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them before they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that by full and sick\nAfterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd there are cases when many black women and black of turned up in homes right after paper in using wager boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know they should have real phenomena but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X. files you know you put those two issues to get back that's how I Would sort of describe based but many black mistreat it's far beyond you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans in helicopters or that some of 'em are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nI'm passionate about the market and I like to keep it simple my methods are changing thousands of lives and I'm confident it can change yours\nBut let the proof do the

paycheck proof dot com that's paycheck proof dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back we're talking with Dick Redfern um you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around and sort of the the the inspiration for this new book of yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou're talking about the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately in of course you know for subsequent generations Tyler do grow into a world where I've never known any different you know I'm In\nFavor of a certain age you know before the Internet age will remember that um that was not that sort of um worldwide surveillance that we have now and um\nYou know I think that's one of the unfortunate things for future generations it's gonna be helping normal thing for them and and probably accept it as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they don't want to be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nKinds of ways been in effect they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all could carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would put time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what Iliad alien abductions are all about that that idea would seemed preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication guide to the first to November but people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which again the classified through the ... in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that wave yes it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWind up present paper with the guy to showing how falls would they put together now I'll start the book actually with the contract a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak but um\nGovernment agencies do are put together falls on paper planes have had I mean ... for example just about all of the contact Hayes of the Nineteen fifties like Joe ... castle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on the one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm able to you by the FBI but yes like ... and say Israeli and but they told the FBI that they may have had\nA government government's very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... was about ... and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape April now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September ... he won a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case some backup but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when John full around his book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then\nIt was kind of get waited um they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive and it revolved around among my Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing is that they\nThey ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the ... it talks about how the they ... they promised and security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of by this encounter with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling intriguing aspect is that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world that Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together but has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact ... and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking\nSort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful\nHarmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then you realize that these guys telling you is crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally\nBut when you realize that the government use\nReally does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they conclude\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going round people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that that sold him huge figures are gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and a dump ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country\nAnd he was talking about\nHow the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments on the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open the file on a damn ... um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination tangle\nWhoever was doing base one to Greg and college and I know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the you up a field who you know are are not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous road to go down um but in shame batch I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many people associate them with capital ...\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] you know it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um\nYou know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you\nKnow we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\n\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah\nIt is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of problem my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one move in a new direction by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and habits are the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents isn't anything after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\nSummoning a around the western world but interesting spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America um believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say\nA participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional ... with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the option a really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so I've tried to think about and trying to think well where where people get in that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and and offensive and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with offensive on mystery and wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for new spiritual infection and I and I um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time to lay normally charge it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of\nWhy those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nI Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to have a\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with and\nThen you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nOr in this would be you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow a anybody to talk about the other dimension I made a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived ... sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts\nBut but the square character did have these wild ... and even at the visionary experience right where he thought that that was that there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\n... I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise]\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through trials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or we're talking with Christopher white about\nOther world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the break\n[noise]\nFind out where George Nouri speaking ... website scroll down to the bottom and click your just humid or\nEven\n[noise]\nWould change you know\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd you get the recognition they deserve their role influencing pop culture and public opinion and you decide which cash ...\nSaturday tree of life rabbi Jeffrey Maier said the community will rebuild\nOffering a new light\nOffering a ... a new generation that collectively people will come and say\nThat's how you're supposed to live your life\nTo men accused of committing the murders is due in federal court this afternoon prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty the Boston Red Sox win the world series feeding the Dodgers by one in game five in Los Angeles Boston first baseman Steve Pearce who to home runs he was named Ceres most valuable player\nWe're a bunch of a grinder and it's often you know the way we played a day out you know we backed out of each other in a vacuum when we we knew we were going to be he was\nOn Fox Sports after the game was\nBoston fourth championship in ...
