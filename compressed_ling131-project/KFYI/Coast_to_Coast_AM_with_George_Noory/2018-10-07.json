additional conditions or exclusion map came Sierras inspirational\nHi honored to be on your show I Love your show and highly addictive\nWhy did we can then you were in the war in the ...\nAnd ... with us but I don't understand is that well I Know there are consequences ... because I Know Richard ... lawyer at the time of really good guy by the name of Lin wood\nUh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job\nUh I Know it's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason we have public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally\nGo down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job winning out the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if we're if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down a road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nTime I've ever had I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney at um pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nYou know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this\nThey have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt\nAnd now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and where is just snowflake gonna vote\nEt cetera and it comes down to the three any Mitch McConnell had been a real warrior and pushing for actual chairman graphically not on the Internet and I think that in the crap\nYou're exactly right it can make it through a week ago if we would have had like ... or ... or China I think he's here that we might not ... ... and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nBut because they have political calculation didn't mind you had Joe Manchin looking at it gate or\nFive thirty percent margin that people want to see an confirmed by three margin that people have North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr high can't or mansion or diners cannot vote for the nominee don't ever get out of principle because their humor lapdog but they might get out of their own political interests to factory right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their constituents in West Virginia Florida\nNorth Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again\nAnd that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nGet real does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's the conscience of the conservative ham and if you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter]\nAre delusional you will never be the president of the\nAimed at style convenience security and train piece of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's right oh save

here never been on pills before\nBenjamin a Radford calling been or at least I'm going to call them been he signs as emails ban uh one of the world's few science based paranormal investigators he's done a firsthand research into all the different phenomena ... and this is cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well we'll have to ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA you know studying this kinda stuff psychics goes on and houses ... miracles that that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about is the miracles but also big foot like monsters and you know Loch Ness things like that UFOs reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving mysteries of the Santa Fe court house goes into thousand seven\nUh also it will have to ask you about the cheap cheap a cobra\nAnd twenty ten he he knows a whole lot about creepy clowns he calls them bad clowns I'll call them creepy clouds they are bad clowns and\nHe's the first of all to fully examine\nThe evil clown phenomenon and I was going to talk about that tonight within the there's so much to talk about with him but I think I Want to say that for something else or another day 'cause you can actually talk about creepy clowns and bad clowns ... three hundred sixty five days out of the year right\nSo uh we're going to get some we're going to get we're we're going to learn about the origins of Halloween and uh it it's just really cool to meet him because he's been all over and you know he's been all over television as well and he does like to keep it science based so let's bring him on here\nFor the first time ever on coast to coast welcome Ben to coast to coast am how are you a picture of me\nI I Love will is we need to trademark that that's great\nI Know right and she went over there and check out the domain hurry up and get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right all of it that's\nFun stuff so you're very similar to me he got deal TV background and the passion to know the truth and studying everything and try to pull it all together so when I\nYou know found you know I was like oh my gosh he's like you like this is great so have you been able to go all across the planet I mean you've been everywhere this is this is good\nWell there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there's a lot of money and fame grain bankrolled by some sort of X. files department but I'm not basically\nYou know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir do things like that but I'm but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly to answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like ... if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking\nInto ghosts again All right you know it's like they're like we're going to be the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool idea there's monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so\nThat that's that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa notes where uh you know I I happen to be there any way and so I turned into investigation one I can\nYou said that you would look at midnight and they would see their future husband reflection\nAnd all these little example was bobbing for Apple you know if we're not new apple bobbing in the particular holiday tradition that if you got a pie appealed an apple in one long

Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAbout two years ago and he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah and I said trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all\nAnd you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Would ever but\nI wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray or candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember that would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off and actually the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nIn ... or something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers that okay but he did it yes so then you can see all the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this yeah law something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nBeing and in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the witch trials be have you know they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right you'd actually have families coming together to make a kid's costume\n... and what you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and you know plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future um Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ... that's a good question you know I think that um you know the Halloween as mentioned I mean it's\nIt's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you were with each ... each you know a couple of generations it changes a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken it too far a in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like ours and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going\nGot to ... to\nThe house David your guy that has overcome a severe issue or whether\nLight the light bulb went on and I started to research on there to say ... I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough they made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing\nThe product war and not only works in one way it works as a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy that gives me right charity\nCare and I and my house just a better way carnivores build everything back into my body taken a while but you know ...

will hear on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented time we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the\nWill of saline theme of\nGoes tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it\nBut I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil\nWith some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted house you know reached out and grabs her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's if for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean a a mentioned before you know following was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause panic because of its roots with with with pagan ritual but\nYou know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't warship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they\nIf if you during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some corn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the fans paid here what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's but there's tradition of course when you look at accidents twenty two Eighteen\nYou know ... not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more obviously comes up every\nEvery year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighty with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there doing investigation and looking to go and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a weed you born or strictly prohibited anyone using ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the\nThe owners were so concerned that using a ... was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you find this don't use it and so you\nKnow typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and the\nAh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations at W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrowed mine either right away I Am doing those\nYou freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great under you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face would last for us for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nMember on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on the air now are\nSo well\nKnowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and they say ten of part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nAnd ... they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequently the water temperature drops wherever it is and they're ... they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it at ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eat to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do the sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part ... part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see are those who are going to location they because team of him and do you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal wrapped around we need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever reading as you get\nYour walking around with him after character magnetometer whatever it is what really is you get over that six hours that there can be normal variation that the one that's only happened once a week or something\nIs is Benjamin Radford that we're talking to and we're learning about how

the air with your story that I Love this it's an annual thing that we do it goes to show instead of coast to coast\nSo fun it's so fun WD more into the forgotten about that if you think oh I I'm kind of like you know it's late I'm not going to remember this I don't have anywhere write it down simply tomorrow I'll go back to our website and there's the information it's coast to coast H M dot com\nSound is Adia waves and and you know ... you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we were all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know the recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field is actors\nAnd the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation but but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person you're\nA who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science uh in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates\nMe because I think those are cool [laughter] I think looks are awesome and if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them\nBut I just don't see I don't see a good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why what what is it\nWell you know I'm I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the ghost hunters and believers are across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on in\nThe U.S some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and trees that is the three played other people think that goes for inner dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spears the debt that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions\nIs problematic for goes research right because\nGoes can't be both inner dimensional spirits and you know an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know ... the dead so so ... if you have a friend\nSuch a widely disparate range of explanations that the problems so I I don't know what goes on obviously they're not meant Scientifically Proven I think that\nMy my best guess if they're real would be basically Couric explanation that would be there for years the debt that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for giving us the information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up so we're

like the skin Walker ranch of the u._k. and also close by is like the Bermuda Triangle of the u._k. and not far from that ... the area the skin Walker ranch\nIs a an investigation where it's one of

werewolf\nThis is the world's oldest accounts aboard his claim to be where most no one has ever research these accounts more than ... Sinclair now we can talk to him about so many things but tonight we're going to talk about the we're ... we're going to talk about the least didn't wear wall\nSo Paul Sinclair Paul welcome to coast to coast how are you\nI'm good Ken Coney Island thank you very much for allowing me to come on here and shut a bit of information um you know when I first started researching for the truth proof story at least in in you know little snippets of information would\nGo through and I in all fairness I never expected myself\nDoing as much in the research about too because I'm I'm not here tonight to subscribe to the idea to like come through but I Do believe some thing exists something very real otherwise you know to be unreported income through\nOver a period of hundreds of is you know through the through the ages in fact I mean [laughter]\nAnd ancient piece of where the where the story originates from Coney which the flicks than stock which was probably\nThe most important archaeological site in Britain and one of the most important fights in the world you know some of your listeners may not have you been out of it but it's well worth researching stuck out is that in the middle east middle stone age and just give you a brief outline of the oh\nYeah absolutely it's it's it's a it's an archaeological site dating back to nine thousand bass sea\nMiddle stone age just after the ice age people central\nAnd these people were just on together that they actually settled on flicks them stuck you know the lake he's gone now we've gone from ... to be honest with the cows run across stuck it in some places you can feel the ground reverberate because he's\nSo much to\nThe people I mean this is the evidence of how ever built it by the least that within the U. K. and what was interesting in the research it turns out that the archeologists also found\nRead their school in like a head dress with holes in Fort eyes and and\nUnder is documentation on the line that you'll find that says this we we must also not forget Coney that you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent in the u._k. and bad so\nYou know they were not necessarily to an entirely talking about too where will this these stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the line and you then you go into the research you discovered the flakes than was once called ...\nWhich is interesting and I it's now ... old ... on old maps\nThose areas of flicks then depicted as well fund\nAnd just a few ... somebody changed the name ... to make it like\nLike maybe the\nSeems safer something or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that's like ooh there's a reason why that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the world for you know in any case it is true with proper research there that can be sort of back to pre if anyone else wanted to look into it\nYou know there's a there's a small village just a few miles away called home ... and if you break down the name ... and then go back in history and look we'll do some sort of research and housing hound mom bay it is they used to be called farms that the hound mom\nAll these sorts of incredible connections\nTo the wolf and to the dog there was a an hour that stood on some old maps called bomb dog house we realize once again that this does not throw as into the realms of the ... then when I started collecting these stories when I went and spoke to first hand witnesses\nGoing back to the Nineteen forties I mean

I mean it's an interesting story he said it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that\nSomething was ripping the prey out to be snazzy with my roommates net to catch the rubbish and the has and the other game small game\nAnd his words with ice is proper so to Britain ... born and bred and he's with pretty ... to ... as\nI said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you said there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or they ... as you look you know that was the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime than the lodge hedge homes and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall\nAnd he ... he sort of turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said he thought he was a U hauls it meant halls so HBO the blessing 'cause I thought well you also just\nSuck ... believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small pony or you you know your horse he said and the interesting thing was he left over the edge\nAnd just one that he said wait expects a horse to lend to move forward because the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet\nSudden something not to be nice to look at that he said and he was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen is that he's glad the before the runaway he said but he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it to the stood up into the bean over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said you know he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... that was and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain tilling cooler you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you vote terriers\nAnd not what he ... he says well he said I went on to the edge to them to try and get sentenced Dave is just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing

research into all the different phenomena ... and this was cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well we'll have to ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kind of stuff psychics goes on and houses ... miracles that that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about this miracles but also Bigfoot lake monsters and you know Loch Ness things like that UFOs reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving the mysteries of the Santa Fe court house goes in two thousand seven\nUh also will have to ask them about the cheap cheap a cobra\nAnd twenty can he he knows a whole lot about creepy clown she calls them bad clowns I'll call them creepy clouds they are bad clowns and\nHe's the first the bull so fully examined the evil clown phenomena and I was going to talk about that tonight within the there's so much to talk about with him but I think I Want to say that for something else or another day 'cause you can actually talk about\nCreepy clowns and bad clowns ... you know three hundred sixty five days out of the year right\nSo uh we're going to get some are going to get we're we're going to learn about the origins of Halloween and uh it it's just really cool to meet him because he's

[laughter] snack that right love it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to ... he got deal TV background and the passion you know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it altogether so when I\nYou know found you know I was like oh my gosh he's like he's like I mean this is great so now have you been able to go all across the planet I mean you've been everywhere this is good\nWell there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there is a not a lot of money in\nGrain bankrolled by some sort of X. files department but I'm not exactly\nYou know I I worked for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and new things like that but I'm but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking focal point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like ... if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at goes again\nAll right you know they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool I hear there's a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so\nThat that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there any way and so I turned into investigation when I can\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed with the ... of your future husband so

Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you know 'cause\nI I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it as fun I see it as a I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think of all whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins in\nIn a very fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out

sell as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it\nReally does have um an interesting history very rich in history um it's really scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that we are the fun ones the little peanut characters that's the only sign when he had great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nAbout two years ago and he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\nYeah not to trust you Zach Zach\nWe I was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they x-ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it\nMakes me I wanted for her but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go and train your\nCandy I mean really do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist\nOften are actually at the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nIn ... or something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you know yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so that he can steal stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are ... for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this yeah law something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it primarily for money [laughter] 'cause it always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned\nIt was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily districts with the British Isles and then it came over with the with the first and second we use of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have them when they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\nIn hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy though her you'd\nActually have families coming together to make a gift costume ... and\nWhat you find is that the the first um the in the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this was when you started getting adults who were you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the\nDrag yeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know do something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future on Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a on a good question you know I think that um you know ...\n... ... as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and\nAnd you were with each ... each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nYou need anything from a simple home repairs to a major ... you need to know about home advisor needs a totally free service they instantly can actually win top local service browse\n... is a very easy way contractor and for me it's the only way\nYou can have either for everything your house cleaning ... electricians plumbers handyman\nWe've had nothing to every single time just to let some type of work you need done and home advisors ... technology instantly fines pros in your area you can read customer reviews of the pros even use their ... guide to find out what hundreds of other repairing improvement project costs\nIn your area I think everybody in my back I tell everybody in their home advisors they total solution to any type of work you would ever want to do around\nYour house and best of all it's completely free go to buy their dot com or download free\nGot ... ... ... ...\nThe house David your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nA light the light bulb went on and I started to research on the same reasons why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing\nThe product war and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy it gives me right charity\nCare or how to better way carnivores build everything back into my body taken a while but you know on his back there and I ...

A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\nCounty Willis here on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all lost\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um\nGoes goes kind of stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGoes tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab their crops somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's if for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual but\nYou know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the payment paid hear what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is coming to Eighteen\nYou know ... not suffer which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a weed you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting\nI mean the the owners were so concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you sign this don't use it and so you know typically the\nConcern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that's when because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... motion that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or goal will become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\nParents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know the parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid levine that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations at W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next\nSay you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when they came to Christmas [laughter] just the way allies write that down there a\nMarathon borrowed my idols right away I assume doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stopped because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came in and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the real around the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face with lots of USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that cell or say hey you guys are going on the air now so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and they say ten of part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nThat is they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequently the water temperature drops whatever it is and they're ... they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it it's ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claim they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are easy to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part ... part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's team of them and do you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with him after character magnetometer whatever it is we don't really get over that six hours that there can be normal variation that you want to do this you know only happens once a week or something\nThis is Benjamin Radford that we're talking to and we're learning about uh how he is describing investigating guess his theories his thoughts his book that we've got more of that coming up stay with us from coast to coast am celebrating will is we\nWant to know what\nSurgery will get past this or we always do a Virginia says to put together this a constitution knew what they were doing and uh we've got plenty of low points in our history and I think this is nowhere near the lowest points with experience\nKevin O's nomination was marked by allegations of sexual misconduct as part of the upper ...
