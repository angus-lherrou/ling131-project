what'd you this point appears to be likely\nAnd the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty I mean when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe if the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the United States Senate under Chuck Schumer think about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life because CNN\nAnd the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening to Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the

last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of publish papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers or with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing mole and you're right I'm I'm I'm a listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a worse the civically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses\nThat are associated with these round fractions tend to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that are exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these rose starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that costs number Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so in other words it's associate with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round facts the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and there'll be have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this and that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly but we just it's kind of a the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give up guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier\nThat is a pretty important and this is from eddy yeah and and he says there's a there's a new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion and the use of the lion at go back a tabby\nThe ... everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things are Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley happy not an accident\nThough with his references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely ... it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a ... I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry did yours\nGo back ...

you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short green quick joke about their armored tower just at the end\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly fanatic um and the evidence from that comes from ...\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt or probably from Bhutto\nAnd move towards a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with the with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked a raft\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa maybe you don't ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south and that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds to ... the Greeks adapting uh the etymology a chemistry coming from cabinet right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned it stinks oh my oh we we think that was me eat before uh before Africa game I think it was we were I think it was the lioness and their name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or Joe\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or get tonight my new save da de his paper is right

as we have the supply town and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties some remote viewing him to an intuition and actually reconstruct\nTemples repair the temples half that's been discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter I'm a new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked like the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know just the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nAnd more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh so he'll watch uh my ... many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years in yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there now with you\nRegarding talked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous in as the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study of Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so I'm the one hand it sounds like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah I was was ah still the director

a while now let's go to the first time caller line it's gonna Isaac in Toronto Isaac ...\nPi Manohar you know like Thanks This is a great show I've always just trying to ... to ... to one shouldn't go

uh\n[noise] [noise] oh sorry about it a low\nOkay so I think oh well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is uh the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\n... to ... to ... ... to ... the meaning of the pro which it ... the push language\nKush language which is of course ... ... to ... years ago yeah ... ... or ... or ... the you know we're talking about a quiet of three ... for ... years ago\nIt's been ... older than any other language you can put them in the fall of pulling it show ... which was\nOf people who is this big law it's a cush people still you know which ... which are from the push which do you think like oh it was a little late it was a little people well the pilot or\nThey ... they will know height or somewhere in the oil\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't write some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are saying that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I ... I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were ... going back\nTo a man as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they\nWere referred to as kings yeah right right like ... and men is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same\nA menace ... may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another ah\nAh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\n[noise] yeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different title\nUm and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse in the armor and hors ...\nSo uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after I came you know the designation a net to invent which is basically referring to operate or Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name ah you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like ... he is the first time I was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies or just go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on coast\n[noise] hello hello J. lo J.\nHow you guys doing I don't know how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um Egypt and I'm On my mom's side and I'm growing up as a kid I Would always hear\nMy grandma to sit at least they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the um the great pyramid has secrets to this to tunnels here of their you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their ah grandparents say the\nOne that always stuck with me that I really want it to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt um I really am glad that you're on the show a ... I really wanted to ask you for your um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is there an opening or any access\nBehind the ... year old on top of their head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw\nIn the back somewhere like that that has access to an insight chamber of this ... of the things that I'm holds or something very dear to humanity that we are uh [noise]\nWe're not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWell gee you're in luck because [laughter] man who's been researching ... paper about it so I'm going to it now my new before we get to what's underneath the on the left of parental love from palm\nUh there has been photographs of the top of this being tried in the ground up or what appears to be a half\nYour whole life and I have also read a lot of research about uh the right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year so let's talk about uh the head of this being spurs and possible entrances\nYes so there is that there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a ... there was a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Robert de ... was telling me about this I think ah you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by\nA a chronic a person that was chronicling the quote was a crucial and he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I Need I have to mention shop you know so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the is on the ... basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that discount was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that is that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying that could be theological and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know your review to paper or but she still thinks it's possible that there were logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of course who\nIt's it's it's hot spaces inside research is in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... all we have is built

check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the directions\nTraits meaning\nBut it's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing near one would be size in orientation or to true north and maybe a something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments\nAre lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures\nThroughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be chamber\nOr something and the at the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak it was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not up to her media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very\nTop I I think so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big the chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet\n... and hide I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nYeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new ones can show most\nBoth chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph gotcha bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it you mean by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that uh who Donnan buyer investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nThis online banks for closing on us they even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't want the nightmare\nShe's

Egypt and our guest tonight my new safe side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers\nOver on his website Chiapas pyramids a dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now my new before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening\nLittle rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seemed to have amnesia\n... and ... it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened\nIn Egypt after Cleopatra and we had that ah example of it but it was going on ... for a year she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this uh last week on my other show fade to black which is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years on this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time and more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because a ... a crime and cook a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of this\nUh these are earlier people and uh the only thing that survive or how about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one child as a you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has a major and that you see the statue of liberty

been a excavating a day find actually workers that have a they broke a bone and it was limited\nUm so they were performing sort of you know surgeries are on on these workers when they injure themselves which goes to show\nThat there were not being abused or they were probably voluntary workers and uh\nThey were being well fed and there will be taken care of so um yes the lifespan was definitely shorter than ours but there are if you look at if you go to Cairo Museum you see statues of people there were definitely the older than thirty or forty look at him he would have statue you know the person that I think designed the great pyramid\nUm he probably had diabetes from the looks of it and he was kind of heavy set you know he probably had a little deeper into legs\nBut to me he looks maybe fifties maybe even sixties\nYou know so it's kind of depends\nOne last call let's go to Mike in St Peters Missouri last call of the night Mike welcome\nOh hi always wondering a pyramid itself that we see is that goal that older they're like no other mile underground you know that just like the tip of the iceberg\nThere you go my new is the ... well aside from the descending passage way to the lower chamber is any of that pyramid underground\nOr as ... I'm Sorry I was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so um I you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lot civilizations starting something in ... uh and then the old kingdom\nAre Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that rock\nThat's not human stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in this three locations and they were aligned to you know the belt stars for Ryan a dating to zip peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom a Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks\nMuch older and when you walk into the red pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber there's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top\nSo it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's also\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight Iran coast yeah I loved\nIt thank you so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's next for you\nWhat are your ... one of your listeners exactly the right question about the connection between Quebec early tippy end or in Egypt and that's that's what's next\nThere was virtually no information anywhere on the temples on piracy on ... I guess\nYou would think that the great pyramid which is dominated the vision of every Egyptian for thousands of years right\nThe same as it does with us today by the way it it just dominates the skyline right there off the Nile you would think that there wouldn't be\nA topic of conversation that has carved into the walls the temples every burial chamber in the valley of the ... the walls of luck sir cardiac and flew it is not today\nThere are thousands and thousands of books written about the great pyramid you've got documentaries and they are everywhere the earliest explores all\nDrew it they wrote about it but the Egyptians didn't\nObviously obviously we don't have an instruction manual so it's true purpose is up for grabs we honestly have no idea why who or when it was built I look at it this way\nFive thousand years from now if some archeologists dug up the USB thumb drive that had the history of us on it music art literature\nWould they know how to use it would they even know what it is maybe I don't know but but I Would guess probably not\nBut today the great pyramid is starting to give up some of its secrets last year a new chamber was discovered above the grand gallery I've talked about a lot here on coast of my other show\nThree or four voids have also been found two months ago a paper was published about a focus to E.

[noise] [noise]\n\nWell come back to the coast to coast am I going to church or get to my mind who saves the day and we're talking about his paper that it was published last week and again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six has tried three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers ... with a cut away showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing bowl and you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of pixels twenty three some of these peaks a worst civically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were round number fractious up twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty\nAnd I'm a and those are also listed\nAnd it turns out that those courses\nThat are associated with these round fractious to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have it seems to be a coronation uh thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number ... of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be basis just the same up there and I think at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yeah you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there is some\nSupposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example a course number Twenty one which is a it it that does which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words it's a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are ... there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly yeah\nYou are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give up off guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier\nThat is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back to lead tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the line and see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land a ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things are Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yeah which makes go back leads happy not an accident\nWell within its references of course uh with the lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak what authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top down from the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nEl Al ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry ...\nGo back great Cathy\nYou liked that my news you liked that area [laughter] okay I\nAm a war I always love hearing is that all that you may have roared do you place great for me they gave it up by now\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from ...\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots sly\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt or ... probably from Bhutto\nAnd brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with a mia with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa maybe you don't west to hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds\nThe Greeks adopting a biology a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned it stinks so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before

Kush which which is of course ... to ... years ago or ... or ... or the you know we're talking about a quite of three ... for ... years ago\n... older than any other language you can put in the fall of calling it so ... which was\nOf people who is just big well it's a cush people still it'll ridge back which of from the coach which is do you think like oh it was a little late it was people well the pilot or\nThey should be you know I Will be some way or the wall\nI I'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call\nA minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are things that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old kingdom I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it were looking for new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bomb we're ... we're going back to um meant as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings yeah\nRight right like in armor and men is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be\nSome are saying that the the same\nA menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different kings they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another ah I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that\nThe Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and that the Egyptians that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king\nPaul I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different title\nUm and in the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse in the armor and hors ...\nSo the so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a came you know the designation a missile in bed which is basically referring to operate in Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later ah I I just looked it up and I was like twelve hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies let's go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on coast [noise]\nHello hello J. lo J. how you guys doing hello how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually I'm Egyptian dissent on mom's side [noise] and um growing up as a kid I Would always hear\nMy grandmother ... tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the um the great pyramid has secrets to this to tunnels here oh there you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say\nThe one that always stuck with me that I really wanted to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt\nUm I really am glad that you're on the show a ...
