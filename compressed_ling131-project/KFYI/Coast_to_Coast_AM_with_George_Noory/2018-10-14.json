created\nCalled out of body exploration intensive and at the ... renowned and ... Institute in Virginia and William cells as a\nSuicide Hitler therapist and he guide you through these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience they love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such a system such that I ... out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer in this would be impossible but\nI had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate\nOut of body experience so I explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first\nFully conscious out of body experience and it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a\nBeliever but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your tire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is now you had your out of body experience with sales induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise or that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nAnd was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where'd you go what did you experience how did you know that this was the Centers for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night\nAnd the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out oh no I was nonsensical\nI I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah\nWell it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained answers for yourself ... ... that said I think is the most important\nThing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't get me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system mhm\nI always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that were in\nIt doesn't stop it couldn't have stopped here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here in which all of the systems information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any sense\n[laughter] absolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nAnd\nAnd that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah all human there has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not ... it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can that I can express\nYeah it is it absolutely is\nSo now when you you have these experiences and union of their meal because especially they feel real you aren't you blame them because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what another dimension is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died\nA I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing but\nThat's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes I there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes need teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invasion only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in a checked unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um\nWhat is that in the fold holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nMm mhm so to assist in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA a\nTragic incident national tragic incident where Massachusetts toll free number one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven narrow\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of the regional banks where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way badge and you're having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone\n... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a it's an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions in different names and different cultures and up to the Institute\nWe we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can\n... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable which no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because really allow the person to have their own experience with the knowledge that I Want to find out a little bit more about\nWhat other cultures or does this and what it's called another culture or going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and

during doing workshops\nWow in this it didn't you had already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um\nI was familiar with it but most out of body experience and just to be clear or are spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain parade alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe than than you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science hasn't told us that so\nMany people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over or their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people aren't going to be travels he gained ... brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research and matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery\nWere twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about\nHow to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly\nHow to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about finding in these what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the mind\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device I'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most\nBut my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to ... because and my guest is William ... and he's talking\nAbout ... Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research and then ...\nSays native or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the ... e training at bin ... vision ya and he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with the the ease Cleveland was wondering if you could explain this to our audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um but I've been\nStudying this and practicing for forty a ... just to go on my website astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nUh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched\nThat was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone and that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your clothes diluted\nAt night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical\nBody\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that's the dance on it because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think his muscles in or are you saying that now the ... say\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experience or have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate\nAnd you can observe this actually\nDuring an out of body experience and what does it look like the image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream the cancer\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ...\nTemporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nDidn't ... biological ... machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it didn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess or play ...\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awaken to this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance\nI had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back in the seventies and I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning\nAnd I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my\nLet's just say one of my sons was with me at the time and um my point is that when a Austin will get information given to us\nWe open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOf what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything like a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all\nBeen programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real\nAnd look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this big and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\n... it is

recount cancer and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest just a sec says something to do with it\nJail it's ridiculous and you realize it's you know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the\nCore issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day and I knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being ... no ... none of that would occur\nMhm because we would know better\nIf we really truly

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if your fear based and you take\nHer fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences that's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell your creative powerful being ... and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into it incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got us in their cycle and took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize

... two legends dot com and I love the beginning of it says welcome to the blue moon hunted history tours Ruben probably scaring the public since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the ... out of it it's lovely record\nI was thinking about the commercials say can you really say piano or is it is that there's is there any way to go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do our you know constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we are normal\nWell this this I've been seeing go since I was ... an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening and so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding\nAnd after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend ...\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits\nOut of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so\nThe two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community\nNow we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and leave we call it ... feast because every year\nWe try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history\nSo even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to thyroid cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nSo what do you mean seeing it you've you've\nI see it and I actually feel it\nOn the frame like humans to my examples that\nI can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually send things [noise]\nUm I'm In path I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of the term but I hadn't very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos gonna win the football team I Can't protect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional storyteller from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nAnd manatees Springs Colorado any lives hunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head hon\nIt wine and cheese parties did you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love the story this was way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\n... extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans\nAnd said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house or what have you well after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist\nYou know and it's very severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about it just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike wow I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was\nEthic my goodness you know things fall out literally everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the\nGhost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of the manatee springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my hope this will shake in my hand and never find true north I kid you not\nThe the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in the sacred places the trees actually grow kinda sideways and it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up and ... um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies\nUm Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managed to spring with like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense the ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they had birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal in their brain and it ... the he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of these magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and in like ... the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest

she is not only a professional storage other as we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you what we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nKnow I'm\nI think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nSnow yes all of this worked out beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing during the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said\nHer job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team because this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nAnd you know this was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes you seem to be the you know like the public is for these dose of the\nMain thing is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goes but like other little girls that bounces the ball isn't she do I'm like no\nLeave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nAbsolutely not if they are they're just kicking you and your tricks or it's here\nThey are in prison here by their own their own their own minds they're they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nDo you notice that their peak time\nOh yes [laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ...\nThat that goes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for those if you want to see them with your eye is at the in between when the sun is just setting it in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting and if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right San ... an artist and oil painter lends itself to the shadow is that makes sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nI call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we had a youthful because of the way that bounces off the rack and that led to the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now hunted or did you met with non ... and the gas I think goes follow you\nRight they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath ... life they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend has well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of the trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this town is very hunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah you too I mean I heard that sometimes it just happened to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh yeah oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic trick them no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other\nWestern towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and absolutely as\nTo part rain there oh yeah that you know the family hotel right there on that a native them it's very sacred Native American land ... they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even as to part with ... with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up light up with the red energy\nI find that very interesting you need all the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains very sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine as you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of a war of the pikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that

oh\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and we're talking about Colorado legends in lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore spiritual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um I speak I think it was called T. T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native youth she used to call it\nBut they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why would rather called that connect it to the mother okay yeah it's connected\nTo the mother and think about the native is the way that they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth mhm [noise] and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of I hate and cripple creek as I understand it during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more equal than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm pretty sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient alien and they talked about that that we had a lot of UFO citing silver pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of ... of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs\nI found that most of the sighting happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers took flight over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it was clear daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards it other than it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloon was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone exactly exactly\nOr even weather balloons wouldn't have behaved the way that the beast it\nMhm

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it just for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after a series of days went by\nA one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently it's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is it now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nWas my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that said I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can\nYou can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the sort of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience at first and and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that were in\nIt doesn't stop it couldn't have stopped here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here in which all of the pistons informations as human beings why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any sense\n[laughter] absolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human there has to be it wouldn't just be one that did not want him anything\nNo of course not ... it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can that I can express\nYeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because especially they feel real you know he was playing the because usually not language to really clearly defined what another dimension is is there a universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died\nA I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed and all communication is very elegant it's by solved\nAnd there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by soft and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel\nIs the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes need you teach them and really tell us what to look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise] yes\nIt is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia I'm\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally when I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation booth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nMm mhm so to a system in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA a\nTragic incident national tragic incident where Massachusetts toll free number one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those facts where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way by junior having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions and different names and different cultures\nBut nothing that I went to ... we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can\nDo that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience and all that I Want to find out a little bit more about\nOne of the culture a justice and what it's called another culture or going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can get it on your own [noise] and it will like apple against William bum and I am a cigar and listening to coast to coast and\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... dot com\nAllowing\nNa na ... while we were getting\nGrand a year and a half as many you know we can only have\n... ... total effect\nBecause they get a diet levels and I didn't want to call it so we had enough information now I Want to go so rapidly over the next twenty four\nHours President Trump addressing pool reporters before heading to a Kentucky Campaign rally both President Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell at that Kentucky Campaign rally for GOP congressman Andy car last night because I used a moment to applaud the presidents judicial selection process\nThat record Mr President setting of our way of Wilkie farming mid range the court system\nCenter McCall thanked his party for the confirmation of several federal judges\nThis is Fox News\n\n[noise] my room and show it's more than just said you didn't get to talk to my one day on TALK to anyone else pat I'm\nExactly the way he would fix it for his mom I'm On every Sunday former seen sort of buy in my dog stadium never wrong\nThe prime save money and call Donnie and Donnie is that\nGo to be sunny plumber dot com by hiring me oh\nThis is what I Would like you to be Fleetwood Mac lives going on\nThe road when I was looking forward to the most is getting into the Toulouse the most time communicating with\nNa\nNa\n\n\nIs coast to coast am now here's your just does lead cigar\nWelcome ... ... am or what is that you know that I also have a show on the same network that George ... is\nOn on the guy in network if you love watching him on beyond belief you can watch my show there it is called inspiration on guy with a thick are and if you check that out inspirations on guy out which is Ga IRA\nHe gave me my ninth seats in there and we have a brand new shows I think yesterday actually going to be what if my upcoming gas on inspiration to definitely check that out information on guy a dot com I Will be right back with William both men and I think you could see cars and\nBoy it's going to be a fun twenty Nineteen especially if you're a fan of the live feed her experience everybody producer Tom here and we're in the midst of planning our twenty Nineteen life stage shows and we're kicking it off with a show in March twenty thirty beautiful Everett, Washington\nFor tickets and information you can go to the coast to coast damn website in the oven section where you can call four to five to five\nEight six seven six six from there will head on\nLimber Ohio in Fort Lauderdale Florida so please keep checking back with the coast to coast am website show details will be found in the event section go now to coast to coast am dot com that's coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nMessage and to raise ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business\nDegree that further your career in case you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders and what if you could earn that\nDegree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more checks path to seven nine six four or five that's P.

V. I. T.\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to ... because and my guest is William ... and he's talking\nAbout ... Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research and then really\nSedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the ... e training at bin ... and yeah and you come up with a common let me put it in nominal associated with the the things he explains some of this or audience\nYes I'm\nJust to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um\nBut I've been studying this in practice in it for forty or just to go on my website astro info dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way\nAnd it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally\nTo the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset of Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your closed eyelids at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a\nYou're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is\nI find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that's I see the ... on it because that happened if I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles in or you saying that now the ... you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floating I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLosing ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they are twitching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream the can or they may be running in their non\nPhysical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ...\nTemporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years we\nDidn't have any biological ... machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into and it'll be and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's\nA master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification\nAnd I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier and World War two and I also found out that my\nLet's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get to download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because new ones\nTelling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that that self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything like a specialty uh religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of first out of body experience have you seen ... years old that people ... recount their cancer and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but it declines during the early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest just affects us something to do with
