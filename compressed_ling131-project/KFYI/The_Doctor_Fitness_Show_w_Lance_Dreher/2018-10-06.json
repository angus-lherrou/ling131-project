all the time we have for today thanks again to our sponsor Dr Newton's natural you can visit them online anytime a doctor news dot com for all of your supplement need and be sure to join us again next week for another great show I'm Chris may have a great day everybody\nWe buy those valleys talk station is used dogs five fifty why Phoenix Jay y o da de do Phoenix\n[noise]\nAll nighter on the Senate floor I'm ham who south Fox News\nToday painful day for millions of women all across the country Senate\nDemocrat ... brand a short time ago as senators make the case for and against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hours before an unexpected confirmation vote\nTask and we're gonna talk instead about you're giving\nThe opposite of greedy I think a very clean not an washed\nAnd I'm very deserving spouse okay and so we're gonna talk about how to ah protect your spouse in the event of your dad how to create a trust for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust just like the thing you stick in your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property and so we're going to go over that but jak can you play it\n[noise] I Know I\nWould say\n... am\nI Am\n[noise] and\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nSo but this week as I said we're deviating we're going to talk about your love it and most valued spouse okay so we're going to talk about a Q tip trust so\nWhat is accused of trust will basically\nYour if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your stayed for a state tax purposes and all that you're half of the state is what would normally go into the Q tip trust or some portion thereof okay now the Q tip trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of this trust or set up for their benefit\nSo what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decides where the money's invested your spouse decides on distributions from the trust so there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse\nThat's number one there is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's called hams H. E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean\nI mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support they can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle they\nCan't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter] okay [laughter] so they have to they have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money you can name a different trustee to help with that\nAlso if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children and you want your\nTo be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the cue to trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new ... husband or wife that that is in the picture can have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called de Q tip trusts qualified tour mental interest property a cue tips easier to say\nAny way hum if you'd like to talk

time six to three two two five eight one five seven next eight people\nAnd said I look at his other articles and from week to week I bring this stuff up\nYou know about ... article from the daily mail they mentioned they're Twenty years Twenty years before I suffer a developing diabetes they have warning signs you may ask okay what is the warning sign\nWhat's the warning sign you know Cleveland Clinic a long time ago back in early to thousands made the comment\n\nThat if your blood sugars over Ninety milligrams per desk leader they classify as pre diabetic\nI guarantee you most of my listeners out there their blood sugar is over Ninety\n\nOkay so they're saying from this news article Twenty years in advance and I'm a put something else out there if your triglycerides are more than double your HDL cholesterol guys\nYou also fall into that category so if you got an ACL cholesterol let's say forty right mind Seventy six by the way\nHe uses forty and your triglycerides are Ninety it's within the normal range but you've got something going on\nWe also know us those triglycerides go up to more of the LDL that's they called the bad cholesterol becomes damaged\nOkay it means that you might have something cardiovascular cardiovascular wise going or or the possibility somewhere down the road that happening because they're saying if you're blushing his own over Ninety increases your risk of developing heart disease by over three hundred percent if your blood sugar was over Ninety\n\nOkay but if you have a blood test done there saying anything above a hundred was over Ninety\nI remember when they used to say if your blood sugar was under one twenty was good now they've got it down to one hundred they're getting closer\nResearch says under Ninety if they can if they can tell you Twenty years in advance that you you you have a good chance of developing diabetes why can't you make a lifestyle change\nBefore you develop diabetes or other issues you know when we have health problems when we have you know cardio vascular issues and we developed diabetes we have joint issues that relate to being overweight that's not something that happens overnight\n\nThat's something that happens over years and all of a sudden it shows up you\nOh my God I didn't realize what have you been doing for so long\n\nYou know obesity is rampant in America seven out of ten people are overweight or obese higher than anything\nYet we have an increased number of people ... joint problems for ladies out there where you would need shoes and guys you too for every pound you're overweight is four pounds of pressure on the knees deceiving double ... on the back\nAnd yet people walking around it looks like they're pregnant inner sixty years old guys and gals\nThe extra weight in front you ever see what the ... looks like it develops to sway it's like you're carrying a big old person in front of you to the ... ways to try to treat that weight in front so what does that do it put stress on your back\nWe're not meant to have a big belly particularly one that looks like you're pregnant\nAnd when you're carrying that kind of weight around in your gut is a good chance that you you have cardiovascular problems because years that they've they've done research between the hip waste ratio and they said that's a bigger determining factor than just overweight\n\nBig waste mall if you're in trouble reading your own and sixty pounds or a hundred and three hundred sixty pounds\nThat's sugar fat and planning which carbohydrate overweight and yet I'm sitting there in front of me on the computer of right in front of me here at KFYI that says this is what's recommended for diabetics\nIf you eat two thousand calories a day she consumes about two hundred fifty grams of complex carbohydrates per day this is a good start starting place for people with diabetes is they have roughly forty five sixty grams of cops per\nMail in Fifteen to thirty for smacks\nYou realize how much that is sixty cops for a meal forty five this sixty I'm I'm I'm really active guy and I'm ... I'm fit they'll tell you that Lance looks fit\nI'm not ready for Mr Universe competition but I look fit and I'm strong in ladies and gentlemen I've got perfect blood profile you know a steel Seventy six triglycerides of thirty two blood sugar about eighty\nYeah and I'm fifty three years old and I I eat sixty grand in a day not in a meal and I'm not a diabetic\nSo to recommend this kind of said you know that's to me I'm not going to go this far but you know to me that would be as malpractice\nIf you're even that in practice just to put that out there for people to read that okay when a diabetic and you're telling me eat sixty ... forty five sixty grams per meal Fifteen to thirty grams per snack\n\nWhen when you look this number of people in this country that are pre diabetic eighty percent of men and women over the age of fifty five have that problem if they this much they're going to be a diabetic", "show_name": "The Doctor Fitness Show w Lance Dreher", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "06"}
