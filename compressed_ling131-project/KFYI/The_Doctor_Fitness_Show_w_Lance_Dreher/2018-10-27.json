see for yourself how well this works so again the number to call is one eight hundred\nTwo one two\nAnd so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you play it I Know I\nWould say you know\nBlog and may be\nFive\n[noise]\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay\nSo as I mentioned the gift tax exemption a is a Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS\n[noise] [laughter] ah almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon\nYour desk and it goes to whoever um and they want it attacks that so they created the estate tax but the rest is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they died as no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we are going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that\nBut they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars\nPer person that you can give to and as a married couple you can give thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd then by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as the estate tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child\nThen that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore it doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college I'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo ostensibly pay for the tuition\nGuess what Scott was doing he wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know this this Staten mono thank God and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember bury the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up and time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway as I mentioned\nWe are affirming that uh we uh we especially we

oak trees are still in the same place so let's see last year that's what I like consistency when I was not like I'm going any wherever the next couple of hundred\nYears I Know I Love it a turtle turtle is not here yet man he's late every morning you'd think it would have learned by now to leave the night before meetings okay squirrels anybody seen miss\nThe forest tested repairing just for you visit a forest near you today to learn more about cool things to do in the forest visited discovered the forest dot org brought to you by the U.S Forest Service and the ad council\nFrom Michigan I work an extra part time job serving lunch at school but I still can't afford food on our cable\nWhole spine it's kind of like a I'm a football fan so it's kinda like football right so you have ... defense and special teams so in order for the team to win each component of that team has to perform well if one part of the team doesn't perform well and you don't have a favorable outcome\nSo we look at the I'm going back to the lumbar spine\nFor one the spine is renewable the spine it regenerate itself\nThe funny thing is no one has more than a disk that has fourteen months old so these disks are constantly repairing and replacing themselves\nWhat what did I just say disc can heal themselves yes they can however we go back to crazy town where they are given and said for back pain what and said do\nThey destroy cartilage they destroyed discs they blocked pathways necessary for the body to heal up correctly so maybe some of the medical profession may say well no discs don't heal cartilage can't repair itself well because you're giving them drugs that block\nThe disc from healing so therefore you're never going to see a disc Keeler regenerate 'cause you're blocking it from healing so go back to\nThe body being smart and not doing anything stupid the disc can repair and regenerate themselves however it it's not an overnight fix fix desks don't have a direct blood supply\nThing they require movement to stay healthy\nSo what happens with that disk injuries you have lack of movement at that particular segment that can cause that disc to injure\nSo however these discs they're very very strong so you basically have eighty interconnected rings of ligaments that surround this thing in the middle called the new to this poll pulses so if you were to touch set in a healthy spine it would feel like crab meat\nAnd you can think about intertwined Kevlar vest around it protecting that nuclear pulses it's very very strong\nAlso when you look at this idea of the spine which should be curved why is a curved will see a spring the spine acts like a spring so if we have\nAbnormal alignment abnormal curvature of the spine that puts an extreme amount of pressure on those disks and they can't handle it sudden they rupture you get tearing of those and the other fibers that discuss injured and you're in a lot of pain and it's a rough couple of weeks\nSo some of the best options for lower back pain or how to prevent them is where we just talking about is movement we need to keep moving we're not we don't\nA lot of us don't live can grew with our genetics and Lance talks a lot about exercise and how important that is go back to looking at that that skeleton maybe in your front yard for Halloween\nAs you just have those five little bones that are isolated down there with a lot of ligaments connect in there you have a lot of muscles and that is what we call your core but your core just doesn't simply\nNot simply limited to the lower back it actually extends all the way up into the ... part of the year glue so your butt so all of those areas are super important to keep in that area stable and keeping it moving correctly so if we don't have movement then we have injuries\nNow so we are going to throw on some drugs every now and then 'cause we're having a little bit of pain you know what's the big deal we can just go to the store the corner market and get some and said to to deal with this pain\nWhen you are destroying that to issue a little bit at a time and preventing it from getting killed up correctly so the great thing about drugs is they actually work really good\nThey work so good that they just walk the pain\nAnd we don't know we have it so what do we do we go out and we're going to hurt ourselves some more and block it some more and keep that cycle going on all of a sudden all the drugs aren't working so well anymore\nBecause he's completely destroyed that area I had a patient come in and a couple a couple of weeks ago this poor lady Twenty years she's been dealing with this lower back pain Twenty years so we'll go back to crazy world and what are they doing they're given her Oxley code on so given her some heroin to help with that pain\nI'm that's working but not not quite getting rid of it so let's do a couple steroid injections keep destroying the tissue\nAnd then we'll throw in some Gavin petting in there and so she's on all these drugs she's hooked anoxic coat on and um this whole time she doesn't realize that her spine is just completely getting destroyed so she's been dealing with this cycle for Twenty years and says steroids heroin Roxy coat on\nAnd that's a tough patient to work with we can help her a lot but we can't reverse all that damage has been cause for all those years by just putting band aids over it and then giving chemicals that further destroy the problem\nSo what we did was we we took an X ray and the fun thing about what when you go to a chiropractor\nYou have lower back pain but we're not just going to look at the lower back 'cause remember the spine it's one big articulate you know a part of our body so if you look at the neck for instance\nIf the neck is the head is forward what's gonna happen there so the the head weighs about twelve to Fifteen pounds that's going to put a lot of stress on the back on the spine the shoulders are going to roll forward and the lower back\nHas to work extra hard to hold you up correctly so we also address or cervical spine to to help bring her head back\nOver her shoulder so that decreases the stress on the lower back that's causing this perpetual injury that she that she has so we also don't just look at the lower back we have to look at the palace is inherently you have a lower back issue\nAlso going to have an unstable pelvis to so by getting her ... lined up correctly getting the neck back to where it should be looking at the overall structure of this\nA whole person she got up off the table and she gave me a big hugs oh my gosh I have not felt this good in Twenty years now is just over one adjustment and a lotta times patients will feel this amazing a rash of energy their body's going to start to feel better\nBut it doesn't stop there because if we're really going to heal the body it's going to take time these discs they can heal themselves however we have to kind of get all that credit outta here get those drugs out of here start getting her detox from some of this\nAnd allow the body to start doing it seemed correctly again which is it's a self healer\nSo it does take time to get the body to heal getting someone out of pain that's the easy part but sometimes it shouldn't and that sometimes it shouldn't stop there the patient should continue\nTo do the exercises keep mobile keep active and allow that just to heal itself and that's where I think a lot of 'em are insurance companies unfortunately do really fell short\nOn the amount of visits that they allow a chiropractor 'cause they just kind of see it at this pain model which yeah we'll get the patient out of pain relatively quickly however if you want to let the body heal\nAnd so we can do to help prevent lower back injuries is for one let's not set a lot and get with Lance Lance is wonderful with with I him and I we work with a lot of patients together and the idea is my my goal is to get them functioning and moving and then\nHis goal is to keep them moving and keep them a healthy weight\nHealthy muscle mass and once you have these injuries and the prevents them from re occurring if you're going to take care of it and exercise and\nKeep mobile and also um you can things considered nutrition as well um we talked about maggots are tea is a great product to help with the\nThe muscles titan is that it's just that chronic muscle titan is um you can also do things like glucose ... MSN because what do we talk about the beginning is that these disks are still alive\nHowever we don't we don't get the required nutrition and that's what a supplement is for so if you think about if someone were to put a whole chicken in front of me were actually designed to eat that whole chicken we should eat the cartilage the tendons the bones but we don't we just kind of cut off the the meat\nIf you think about shrimp what do we do we take off\nThe show we take off the tail we eat the meat so we actually should be eating the whole shrimp so we don't eat these are the nutrition products that we need to actually um give our disc the nutrition they need to heal and then coupled with that is\nWe talked about and salads and how dangerous they are and how they destroyed tissue\nBut yet they routinely prescribe for these injuries and so that's just going to prolong your injury and prevent it from actually healing up so what are some natural things that you can do to help with inflammation well there's things things called systemic enzymes\nAnd enzymes um they work like pac man in a way if you guys are played pacman that kind of go out there and eat up inflammation but it's it's natural ... plant based arrive\nEnzymes so there's things like by the way ah there's two Merrick\nThere's ... I'm ginger all these natural enzymes that have taken systemically\nThey actually help eat up inflammation and the cool thing is they don't destroy tissue like insides and steroids do that's making your problem worse\nSo give me some open lines six so two to six o five three Ninety four we're gonna be cut into a break and we'll be back in a few minutes [noise]\nAll right good afternoon this is Dr Michel ... here and we're talking about a final\nDysfunction final problems neck pain headache lower back pain we do have some open lines sick so two to six o five three Ninety four [noise] again my name is Dr ... Michel and I am the owner and I'm soul practitioner\nAt Mitchell chiropractic actually what we'll do is up from now until four thirty the next ten callers\nWe can offer a complementary consultation examination and will actually do X rays if needed and typically X rays are a good idea to help fully a diagnose the whole problem so our clinic number six to three eight seven eight eight to zero zero and I believe Liz will be the one answering the phone\nSo a six to three eight Seventy eight to zero zero for the next ten colors will do complimentary examination consultation X rays unfortunately this does not apply to a Medicare we can't offer special deer deals to Medicare patients however we do work with Medicare so we can still get you're taking care of\nAgain six to three eight seven eight eight to zero zero so going back to lower back pain and problems there's a lot of um treatment options out there um in our clinic we provide care because human beings get care treatment is something that uh you do to raw sewage\nOverall um so we can look at things like spinal surgeries are fusion is um if you were to ask a spinal surge in what is their success rate for spinal fusion they would say Ninety eight percent\nSo Ninety eight percent so what happens if someone has a a disc injury or they go on for spinal surgery they knock 'em out put screws in fake discs in and they wake them up and\nNinety eight percent of them have the disks the fake disk and the screws on the right spot so it was successful surgery done Ninety eight percent success however\nWhat are they looking at afterward then that's where the statistics go down quite a bit so Ninety eight percent of them were more than likely done correctly however pain reduction is not\nAlways obtained in those cases so for the most part maybe about thirty percent so that would be Seventy percent of spinal surgeries are a failure\nAnd then look at the other statistics on what percentage of these patients are still on drugs or pain killers after the surgery and that decreases even more because if it was successful the person should be able to function they should be out of pain and they shouldn't be able to not rely on taking drugs in order to stay pain free\nThat's where I think you know chiropractic care we are the largest healthcare providers that do not use drugs we don't utilize surgery either\nWe basically\nHelp the body structure so that's what we do with an adjustment as you have a thing called the ... and so that's the bones missile line and then it puts pressure on a nerve put pressure on a nerve that hurts and that's what we do with the chiropractic adjustment\nAnd it's very gentle it's it's safe um I have patients my youngest patient right now is two weeks old like well why he's seen a two week old baby will that for a little baby has colic I'm calling the child can be\nVery uncomfortable to be living with that person since they cry a lot so I'm ... still don't really know but maybe the patient or the baby has back pain\nOr the baby could have headache the baby could have acid reflux so it can't tell you what's going on so\nWe can't do a whole lot of diagnostic tests on a two week old baby so what we do is we checked the spine we adjust very gently so when you just a baby and you ought to use aren't babies out there but you probably have grandchildren\n[noise] when you adjusting a baby it's kind of like if you're checking to see if say a tomato is right and you just kinda gently push on that tomato that's about how much force as being applied when you're just thinking in ... and so it's very gentle\nAnd then I have patience wealth into their eighties so not every adjustment is going to be the same for every individual and so they're all very unique I'm safe\nAnd gentle and the cool thing is in um our board the board of chiropractic examiner's in Arizona were not allowed to say that we fix anything um because we really don't what we do is we we correct\nThe subway station so we get the bone moving correctly that's taking pressure off the disks taking pressure off the nerves and then what does the fixing is it is our body\nSo the body is the self healer itself so if we have a self healing machine which is our body and its impeded to heal itself\nThat's for a chiropractor really comes in to help allow the body to heal itself\nAnd so when we left off we were talking some about some uh support and joins support and it's not just limited to the spine or anytime you're taking some of these supplements they're not just gonna they're not smart they don't just noted okay we have an ... for disc injury we're just going to send all her the supplement to that area\nSo these supplements that go systemic so they're going to take care of all the joints of the body so when we look at lower back pain even though it's the most common thing that people get so we also have um knees that are below the lower back so lower backing cause\nKnee pain as well um I think we have Bob Bob in levine good afternoon\nHow are you doing today doing good Bob how are you\nThere I got a question for you um I've always worn out
