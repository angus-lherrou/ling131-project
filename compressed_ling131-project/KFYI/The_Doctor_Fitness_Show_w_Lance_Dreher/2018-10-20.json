retiring is there anything\nThey want to follow in your wallowing\nIn champagne this is money matters with Kendall rape and of course I Am your host can rewrite\n[noise] Becky\nJak I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about what our blood and most valued clients\nAnd we know work with over a thousand families into it and they found\nBeyond absolutely and we work with clients and forty three states\nAnd all of the ideas we talk about on the show these are the same ideas we talk about what our beloved and those valued clients as I mentioned Forbes named our financial advisory firm money matters one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states\nAnd without our clients we'd be nowhere so thank you\nAnd those if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff that if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon is important and uh so we we talk about the estate planning which we are going to do here and just a moment\nBut we also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes are diversification for one case we talk about the whole the whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is a part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean\nOr Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter] there you go\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing is sticking your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property but do we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trust that is designed to benefit your spouse\nSo if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that ... can you play it\nI Know I'm going\nTo\nSay you know\n\nGod\n[noise] and\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the field of our show this week um\nHas been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters and as I mentioned a little bit ago ... we will we not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly\nIt's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have financial security but it's also their families and one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so\nWe created in our firm will be called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today but\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is an estate planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\nIt's not you don't give love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back\nOr doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love then somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but\nIt comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will come to you so our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a burn as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we had to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so a state planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death\nYou leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite accused of trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip and the trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the Q tip trust\nOkay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you get something for you to think about so to show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show on\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing

'cause people thinks it think it takes so long to change your blood chemistry but I mean this is pretty amazing I mean they're not huge significant changes\nBut you kind of the you know it just with exercise and diet what can happen so at the end of July is a one she was a five point five now he's at five point three\nCholesterol was it two hundred and now he's at one eighty four H. deal which is a good class on the body within fifty one now he's at fifty five good\nLDL was the one twenty four you the one sixteen now a this was a big one here the ... let's try to ... now he's at eight five and

diet we see a ... a dramatic drop\nIn their blood sugar okay just changing their diner waste not changing a whole lot\nSo to say about you know you're going to lose weight and or no that's not true it's helpful but it's what you're consuming and what you do with the people over at your place at the\nFitness Institute over their arrowhead and I do is we help them with their eating eating habits by making them accountable to our diets your diet\nOK and making them accountable to the exercise because when they come and do your center is not just come in and doing whatever they they they're on a specific routine that you put together for them or I put together for our people\nOkay that's around their needs and their issues based on what they've got going on physically\nAnd can you not leaving as you like me work with a lot of people are a little bit older\nYes yes and you know Glenn thing have six than uh but my other testimonial is Betty Who began with a two and a half months ago and get this land or even she came to us as because she's eighty two years old and was having a hard time just getting out of her chair\n... you know and and so people need to understand you can gain strength at any age ... she's eighty two years old she had been working out with us now for about three months two and a half months\nA year increase your strength by over fifty percent of and she was sixteen pounds is great\nAnd you know people think that in your eighties you can't lose weight you can absolutely still the weight and your aid and you can gain strength and your age and I think that's that's one of my favorite testimonials right there because you know so many people give up and they say I Can't do it I'm getting\nToo old um or or exercise help you know because most people after the age of fifty has some type of osteoarthritis\nRight they've got some bill right right\nYeah and so it just moving the body and doing corrective exercise helps with posture it helps you breathe better and like I said before you can gain strength at any age\nSo what are you offering there where you located and give the phone number out\nWhere you're at Seventy third avenue and it just
