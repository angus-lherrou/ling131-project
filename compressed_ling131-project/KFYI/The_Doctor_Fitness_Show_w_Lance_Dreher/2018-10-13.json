E. N. S.\nAnd you know hams is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind\nTo they're greedy and washed undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if they are real estate or something like that so talk to you or a financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's

forty year old man walked in there to get his high school diploma I wasn't sure if I could do it\nFor my listeners out there because I Want to get you motivated to do the same things that I've done over the years for my own health let me give you a little bit of background on that\nBefore I got disseminated valley fever and he said when you were changing topics on on that let me tell you how I got to my philosophy a low carb eating before I got\nDisseminated valley fever in mostly you out there no ... no one valley fever is because this is the valley fever capital of the world okay the valley of the sun all the dust coming out of the desert during the what the hell boobs monsoons and stuff like this people breathe is the spores in and they get sick from it\nIn my case I got the worst kind of valley fever you can get disseminate it\nWhat it did it moved out of my lungs move in my body and it ... it first appeared in my CERN Okla Vicki are joining with accountable and joins is certain um at the base of the neck with a lump that formed\nAnd it took doctors for years and three surgeries to find out what kept growing back in my neck\nAnd when they diagnose it and they said uh you have valley fever you have disseminated valley fever and when he told me that the percentage is so low of people that got this is very rare one or two percent in their mind was the worst kind you can get in that\nYou know most likely you're going to die from it this is exactly what the doctor said\nInfectious disease doctor told me about an Eighteen year old female who they had just diagnose a few weeks before that I was at the same type of valley fever who died from it shortly after she was diagnosed I knew of and Mr America from the Nineteen seventies who died from it and here they tell me I've got the worst kind possible it most likely I'm going to die from it\nSo I'm thinking to myself I Can't I have two young kids at the time for now\nLeft that doctor's office basically think in my life silver but then I thought to myself you know God wouldn't tell me this wouldn't do this to me I've got too much to do too much to give for my time to be so short\nAnd I thought you know I Can't give this up and so I kept I thought to myself what if I'd been doing\nOkay that could possibly be wrong I thought I was on a perfect perfect diet perfect health food store diet I didn't eat anything processed very very seldom had red meat mostly chicken vegetables lots of starches\nWhole grains okay we'll oatmeal I potatoes I had a heart high carbohydrate diet and I thought you know what this is the perfect that what can I be doing wrong\nWell I went back and then my books started reading and researching and then start to understand the disease that I had to disseminate valley fever just as a mold which is in the fungus family okay and what these things eat to stay alive are sugars\nAnd their sugar can come from the bread I was eating whole grain the oatmeal lot of fruit okay and uh the potatoes\nBecause I was literally a petri dish feeding my infection I thought well you know what I Need to change so if they put me on these powerful anti fungal drugs OK and at that time my cholesterol HDL ... the good stuff was tan tan\nExtremely low\nSo I did my homework so you know I'm a ... I'm going to change my diet I was probably consuming three hundred and fifty maybe foreigner grams of carbohydrates the day okay say cut way back way back okay and\nMy doctor's recommendation I had to go in every six months for blood test to see what's what's called my taxi tighter ... measurement to see how active your immune system is against us in section was\nRight and so it took me six to seven years eating like this to get to the point\nWhere I didn't need to take medication anymore and then finally when I went off to when my doctor found I was off the medication and it was two years ago and he says Lance you drugs are working really well your Titus coming back stable non detectable says medications working really gets to the doctor I haven't been on the drugs for two years in\nA blue gasket you says you know if you don't want me to treat you I can you know you can send you somewhere else as a no no no no no I Need someone to keep an eye on my section just in case something happens okay they can take care of it\nAnd then he asked me what I did and I told my low carbohydrate and the way I've exercised and he said you know he calmed down and said you know what that makes a lot of sense because when people that eat some sections we put them on a low carb diet\nHe said he had a gentleman who was diagnosed HIV this is the truth now who went on the same diet was able to get off medication and I'm not telling you again that's ... through may have these infections that get I'm not telling you that I'm just saying what he said in my experience\nWell I've been off these medications for about you know you're looking at close to Twenty years now and I've been the same thing with other people okay\nWho had the same type of disseminated valley fever and get them off medications as well as long as they see on the diet so my motivating factor was eat like this so I I noticed that my crush improved dramatically I've got a still in the upper seventies and sixty three years of age in every person I work with on this kind of dietary approach\nOf low carbohydrate got exactly the same results when they follow the program so I'm a work in progress and so when I get my numbers out which I'm going to do after the break okay you too can ... the the the same exact health\nAs you get older boomers is I have by following the advice okay in changing your diet to re

group insulin levels went down by twenty seven percent in low carb route but increased slightly in ... in the low fat group overall the low carb diet\nHas significantly more beneficial effects on weight in biomarkers and this group of severely obese individuals that's just a few\n\nPeople I work with\nOver the years the longer we see them follow this approach\nThe chance of them getting of medications significantly goes up dramatically we've gotten people off of insulin okay by putting change in their ... I Wonder we you know let you notice I didn't take them off insulin Santa be after seeing all that you get I didn't do to their doctor did\nIn my direction they got a hold of their physician then directed them what to do to get off the insulin as they reduced their carbohydrates because they will not need that insulin or as much of it at that point because there were what are they doing they're taking in less carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates increase blood sugar blood sugar goes up the need for insulin goes up well these individuals type two I'm referring to now\nAre not Islam deficient their insulin resistance there is a difference\nWhen your infant deficient you're not making ends on or very little of it that's a type one\nThey'll always be an insulin\nType two they're put on their ... their blood sugar stays elevate it because what what\nThey're not following a diet they're not counting the carbohydrates over consuming the carbohydrates and both the muscle cells and the organs and the fat cells had become resistant to that hormones ability to store energy in them so what happens\nSomething happens that has happened to the extra ... carbohydrates the sugar it backs up in the blood\nSo the body over response by putting more insulin nothing can happen with it except for converted into triglycerides and they continue to get heavier so of course the management technique at that point is that take their patients and put the money I was on because of blood sugars are really high\nSo what does that do the extra insulin that they're using to basically managed their disease makes them gain even more weight it prevents weight loss so when you change your diet and you bring the carbohydrate levels lower\nThan the need for instance goes down because you're producing it already you don't need as much but again you need to make sure you missed it or with your doctor because you do not want to be taking all this insulin when you're driving your car your blood sugars
