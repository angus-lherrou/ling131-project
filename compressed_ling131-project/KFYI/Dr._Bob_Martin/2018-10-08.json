know look I got a question\nUp the red up in a paper a correlation between uh taking ibuprofen and stuff like that and all very cancer when [noise]\nNo I don't know if there's a truth to that\nBut it does have a correlation what about man well\nIt's it's long term use when you're talking about ibuprofen\nThe drug ibuprofen and it's an Advil and various other things I've read not only about what you're talking about the ovarian and women but also a ratcheting up again we're talking about long term used here in which these drugs were never designed to be used on a long term basis five to seven days of the very most in a run\nUh I've also read about lung cancer being associated with a ibuprofen and also I think a brain cancer so\nUh you know when you're dealing with drugs they're there for a reason they help people to improve quality of life but the most important the bigger things on the ibuprofen if you read if you look it up is irregular heartbeat\nPeople take this because he got low back pain or they've got to shoulder pain or ... and they take ibuprofen thing and well it's over the counter must be safe right\nThese same pain killers can also raised a person's risk of heart attack that'll get you before the cancer will and we're talking again about\nIbuprofen these common drugs and you know wouldn't remember years ago when they went from ... at eight hundred mix a down to the two hundred servings now in the ... in the drug stores and a Advil and other drugs there's a lot of these drugs that contain it so I I think what you're referring to his long\nTerm use and you shouldn't be on these drugs long term use\nUh they're dangerous ... province just one bigger aspirin it believe you bleed out if you take them enough you'll your kidneys will stop working your liver it has to be metabolize somewhere and again this is a highly effective anti inflammatory but used judiciously that's the goal\nBut people don't use them judiciously they figure if a little as good a lot better let's keep throwing them back I have I've had people come into my office is over the years especially people in the workforce usually a male\nWho gets hurt on the job they hurt maybe their their nectar back there need their hip or something and they are literally living on ibuprofen because the company yes man the empty doctor who is telling them oh there's nothing wrong with you go back to work try ibuprofen\nRather than referring them out to the appropriate type of care so they can actually get the problem resolved\nMeanwhile they've been eating ibuprofen like a candy at huge amounts we do a blood test on them and their credit levels are off the map they're about ready to have kidney failure and go on dialysis but the empty yes man at the company doesn't give a you know what about them all his job is to put them back to work\nRegardless so uh\nYou got to be knowing that there are options to ibuprofen I'd be province of harmful drug and block certain pain pathways but

I think it could even be understated forty percent of all Americans eat fast food every day and people who are wealthy or affluent are more likely to eat junk food\nAdults between the ages of twenty and thirty nine are the most likely to consume fast foods\nWith about forty five percent eating and on a ... is surprisingly who came in higher where the higher income households\nThey were at one point three times more likely to eat fast foods on a given day than people from lower income homes men were more likely to report eating fast food at lunch and women were more likely to eat\nIt as a snack with more than one third of American adults being obese experts\nSay they're setting themselves up for conditions such as heart disease type two diabetes cancer and many other preventable diseases by consuming\nFast foods on a regular basis well this is all about not getting the nutrition you need and exposing yourself to the toxins out or in these fast foods it's so simple it's outrageous though\nAnd of course that's why a qualified as the health outrage the week All right let's go right back to your telephone calls and questions next up is uh Debbie she's going from Palm Desert California Welcome to the show Debbie hello\nHi Doc Martin quick question again ah regarding on when you're fifty or sixty years old I won't be taking alone don't aspirin a day early well\nI realize that you know the drug companies that aspirin makers have\nBasically brainwash people into believing that it's not true though\nIn fact daily aspirin was found to be useless offers no benefit but exposes so many people to unwanted health problems damage you must not have been listening a couple of weeks ago because I address this head on a couple of weeks ago and you go and listen to it in a pod cast but I'll I'll repeat some of it\nThere was a study of about what Nineteen thousand people I think I recall and a researcher uh there was looking at this\nBasically said that the benefits do not out weigh the risks and put people at serious bleeding conditions and potentially life threatening rain hammer just called ... stroke\nAnd further on top of that people who took aspirin I remembered daily\nWere more likely to die overall as aspirin appeared to raise the risk of succumbing to cancer so why would anybody want to take aspirin on a daily basis just because they've heard that an aspirin a day keeps the doctor away or a baby aspirin it doesn't matter you bleed with every single bit of aspirin you take\nYou were born with an aspirin deficiency while you were born with\nIs the lack of education to know that you need to stay hydrated you need to exercise eat well and keep your blood send out by doing healthy things so it doesn't become so thick so you have to take blood thinning agents like aspirin and ... and all these other rat poisoning that are out there and all the new does your flavors of it\nSo now I'm I'm not telling you not to take it as a prerogative you have to sign up but I'm telling you that that's what the science says even in spite of all the brainwashing that people have had on that topic", "show_name": "Dr. Bob Martin", "month": "10", "state": "AZ", "day": "08", "station": "KFYI", "city": "Phoenix"}
