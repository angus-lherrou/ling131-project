look forward to it they've sort of condition themselves so it's all about\nOur response distress were not taught how to deal with that were growing up we just overreact to it mostly and then wonder

stroke Congress in Montreal recently talked about it\nAnd some of you may never inhaled again but we'll see a ... I was talking about ... medical center listen to these facts is this is absolutely amazing most cancer patients have been led to believe that they're only chance of survival is chemotherapy\nThis may be one of the biggest health frauds in human history listen to this according to polls taken by researchers at the prestigious Mick kill Cancer Center in Montreal Quebec, Canada Seventy five percent of medical doctors would reef\nThe health outrage of the week and the health mystery of the week now at the risk of\nRising a certain percentage of my listeners I must report the breaking news on marijuana but before I Do I Want to let you know that I've never smoked marijuana directly\nInhaled it or exhaled it directly I'm not interested in it I've seen too many people become Lakers\nHave no motivation or just I I just don't think it's it's a good thing now do I believe that marijuana has some level of advocacy with\nPeople who have health problems like maybe epileptic eggs or people who have end stage cancer disease or somebody who's a you know having some other extraordinary problem for which medical drugs don't work or are\nNot indicated and the answer is yes I've seen medicinal marijuana help a lot of people there's no denying that\nBut for recreational use\nA it's a total and complete disaster in my mind\nAnd all yeah I have smoked marijuana in the past but it's always been slip stream secondhand marijuana where a while I was attending a concert\nAnd even some of it in an open air concert and there's the skunk you know wafting my direction the stunt a skunk smoke\nI Can't stand the smell it's bad news so I'm biased but let me report the news to you in a very unbiased way smoking marijuana may boost your stroke risk\n[noise] uh okay so by Fifteen Percent\nCompounds in marijuana may cause blood vessels in the brain to narrow who would want that I Want mine to be wide open not narrowed\nSmoking marijuana may boost the risk of having a stroke researchers are suggesting researchers analyzed hospitalizations of more than two million talkers\nOr two million marijuana users between the ages of Eighteen and eighty four I guess that would cover Willie Nelson between the years two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen\nRates of stroke among non marijuana users didn't change however rates among recreational marijuana users jumped by Fifteen Percent that's recreational I guess that would be like maybe weekend talkers\nStoner which usually leads to you know daily uh use which usually leads to about\nEvery other our use I've seen it over and over and over there's never enough marijuana eventually for serious\nA marijuana users\nSo think about those users of marijuana beyond recreational use what risk are they putting themselves at if their\nToken up every hour or two or three times a day\nThe researchers conducted on adults and marijuana users in the compounds in marijuana in their studies are showing that the blood vessels in the brain are narrowing and when you have a narrow\nBlood vessels in the brain it could trigger the most common form of stroke called esteem mix stroke\nThat's what the scientists are leaving and of course now we know that marijuana can be taken for medicinal reasons in thirty us states\nAll over the place and more and more states are now legalizing it for medicinal reasons Oklahoma was the most recent one\nAnd over four years the rate of all strokes among marijuana users in this study rose Fifteen Percent who wouldn't want to increase their risk of stroke I don't get it now there's been conflicting information in the past\nAh they've talked about in studies about how smoking marijuana actually reduce the stroke and helps people who have had a stroke recover faster\nAnd you know I can only wonder after reading this study if that was sponsored by and it was sort of like eight bought and paid for by the Canada's growers USA\nI don't know I I you know that's why I pointed out that\nYou know it's a serious condition stroke is a hundred and forty people die of stroke every year it's like the fourth leading cause of death in the United states first as medical miss care\nSecond is heart disease\nThird has cancer and then we have stroke we won't want to anybody in their right mind would not want to increase their risk I Would believe of\nTaking the chances of having a stroke just by getting high I smoking marijuana so there you have it\nAnd I'm positive the store owners are going to be ... coming out of the weeds sending me the nasty emails I it auto I've been smoking marijuana since I was too and I'm great I can jump over high building buildings with a single bound I get it I've heard it all\nAnd I've treated more than my fair a number of marijuana users and again I\nI'm not against it for medicinal reasons when there's nothing else that will work but usually there's that's not the reason people are doing it it's for the sole purpose is of becoming and staying stone\nWhich ah eventually in most people not all will cause that person to circle the drain in some part or more parts of their lives\nAnd they want I've seen it [noise] uh they're very few\nPeople in my opinion who will excel and do what they want in life while they're strung out and stone\nIs just part of it just makes sense but again that's in my own viewpoint\nYou

the program Philip hello [noise]\n[noise] good [noise] I uh\nI can barely hear you I don't know what happened right when you start talking company but anyway I got a good one\nSixty and uh oh help me well there are suffering from hormone swearing or about Fifteen Years and it's continuing to work\nAnd where and your parents you know she hormone Kareem were great uh you know a year at a time but you know ... everyone here we are are\nAre getting close to retirement\nOr longer and work and I've been advised to maybe get a card and everything but I was wondering if you had any advice on a medication for that [laughter] if you\nWant to get her help you know pretty at us right now\nI'm Sorry sorry to hear that you guys are suffering in this regard of ... an awfully nice to call on her behalf to uh I'm not against talk therapy for depression I Believe in that I also believe that a lot of people who have depression have other areas that they should look into\nNot just you know analyzing hormones which is very important when there's something going on in that area and needs to be fixed and I'm Glad you're under nature pad the care stick with that but\nYou also have to consider there are many things to add to that like for example the diet what are you eating and who's analyzing that are you on a whole foods diet reducing sugar and caffeine and alcohol those things will absolutely derail someone's efforts\nTo shake away from depression\nSo that would be where I Would begin because study after study after study proves that people who imbalanced their body chemistry by using too much refined sugar in the diet junk food\nToo much caffeine alcohol and other adults rated foods eventually go down hard those same people need to be exercising on a regular basis in getting regular sunlight just those will often extricate the feelings of depression\nNow I liked the fact that you're on your under the care and you're getting hormonal care I Hope that the rest of this side of the equation is being managed as well\nBecause if there are those deficiencies ... whether it be in a certain narrow transmitted Sarah tone and their doping mean or something else you can actually get a blood test to measure this\nThese quantitatively a and readjust your levels naturally through supplementation and the problem gets saw but it's usually a combination of things is\nOr that you know golden magic bullet pill potion or Potter you looking for one is especially when it comes to depression because depression can be very complicated but stay doing what you're doing and start asking questions don't hesitate to seek out the talk therapy\nWith a moist towel wrapped around it for Fifteen to twenty minutes each hour to try to get some of the swelling down in that

that handles difficult low back cases\nAnd he or she will be able to assess if this is a scientific problem caused by a very liberal missile Lyman in your lower back L for el five or\nSomething related to the pair a form of muscle in your products area which can also entrapped decided nerves so those are the things that need to happen in my opinion\nAnd that'll give you the fastest path to the relief that you seek and deserve and I'm so glad you called in to the program because I mean this is you know this pain will get you down over time and you need to be extricate it from it\nAnd I think you're on the right path and it's good that you resisted the the drugs because they don't do anything whether it's a\nA you know a shingles pain or a Saturday and these these drugs do nothing to solve the problem they just poison your body one pill at a time and you were you were wise enough which most people aren't the look up the side effects\nAnd wise enough to say no to that because you

those different\nPharmaceutical nostrum so that they hand out now passed research has shown that people with disrupted sleep have trouble regulating their emotions and this is what it does it beat you down night after night after night and people try alcohol they try all kinds of things that never works\nNow the team that is talking about this triple risk is from Yale School of medicine in Connecticut and as they say it's it's it does not they don't know why the syndrome causes people to think about suicide\nBut says the findings show the doctors need to closely monitored their patience with the condition to catch any signs of suicidal tendencies and then of course drunks come out oh we'll give you a drug once you have a depression caused by\nThe uh wrestle ... restless leg syndrome will just give you an antidepressant\nOr sleeping pills which just adds to the problem it's a band aid chemical band aid approach which makes the problem worse\nAnd of course the reason why people think of suicide when they have restless leg syndrome is because when you deprive somebody of sleep long getting up and use stressed them long enough and they don't see any escape from it\nThey're going to think about suicide eventually ending it ending their pain it would be better not being alive and that's tragic\nRestless leg syndrome\nIs a condition that causes the suffered constantly need to move their legs because of an uncomfortable sensation often described as a creeping or crawling or fidgeting or ...\nOr the legs jumping around or the muscles in these little twitch is that's what restless legs syndrome is about\nAnd the reason it happens is the body becomes imbalance when you write that imbalance the problem goes away and there is no drug that I'm aware of that does anything for this problem besides make it worse\nThere is no surgery for this symptoms are most often severe at night when a person is sitting in lying in bed meaning that the patient they're unable to sleep well at night that leads to the thoughts of the depression and suicide eventually\nAnd drugs like muscle relaxing and sleeping pills to relieve the symptoms they are absolutely not going to do anything they are going to make the problem worse\nAnd so what I have noticed in my own experience as a doctor for forty plus years with people with restless leg syndrome\nThey respond well to finding out what the problem is and you see that a lot of restless leg syndrome patients they have iron deficiency anemia\nSo they need to have their iron measured their total lion binding capacity total iron they should have their ferrets and measured in any one of those can help direct\nClinician as to what deficiency that person has and then recommend make recommendations and it'll solve the problem

restless leg syndrome getting the person off of caffeine\nDrinking more water getting them to exercise making sure that you don't have a structural problems going on in their lower back where the nerves are being irritated to their legs that would be the chiropractor doors domain\nSo there's lots of things you can do to help a person with restless leg syndrome the latest information is about doping me and how some people who have doping mean deficiency which is a narrow chemistry can also generate these or restless leg syndrome symptoms\n\nAnd for that there is a supplement called dope ... four hundred dope of four hundred from velvet beans seeds by a company by the name of America's finest incorporated they sell and distribute this dope off four hundred which elevates the doping mean levels\nWhich not only helps the person was restless leg syndrome and helps with depression it helps to generate human growth hormone helps people sleep\nSo that might be a consideration if you
