{"year": "2018", "station": "KFYI", "show_name": "Dr. Bob Martin", "month": "10", "state": "AZ", "day": "27", "content": "And keep contributing and it it's always surprising to me how many people ask me the question [noise] hey I'm contributing my four one K. but I'd like to contribute to my eye or a child or an Irish John I Want to put her way an additional sixty five hundred dollars and then I looked at their W too and see the you know they only put\nSix thousand or a thousand dollars into an end of the ... right right well the quickest way for them to remedy that is\nGo ahead and start putting another sixty five hundred dollars into your for one to ... or if you can more yeah whatever you're you're you can budget I'm yeah I'm In and that is\nThe first thing but if you're fully contributing to your four one K. ... four thousand five hundred dollars you're over fifty years old\nThen it becomes a little more difficult because it depending on what your income level isn't probably if your income level is high enough to be that big of a contribution\nYou very well may be if you're a purchase went on a plan many times you can contribute to an IRA right under the because of your income because we're in ... right I'm so in that situation\nAgain you you can certainly do what's called a backdoor off ... ... contribution what that means as you make a ... traditional Irish contribution um so it doesn't reduce your taxable income right and you turn around and you can work that non ... contribution to a raw fire right right\nBut now there are rules that apply to that restrictions of course if you got additional IRAs out there there's there's a lot of this is not just a simple thing not assembled cases by some cases it could be\nBut um you know for those out there who have IRAs if you've got are substantial IRA as well as your four one K. and things can get a little bit more complicated but working with a good CPA folks and a good financial planner you can get these uh additional contributions done little extra work but it can be done\nA little extra work and if you don't have much in your and other traditional Irish ... it's a great strategy rising to consider it's not necessarily something to do\nRight exactly right such as you want to understand it before you make that decision uh and that's by talking to the right people All right so appreciate that email getting folks if you have questions anything financially you could send those email questions to me at dear John at\nThe word on wealth that calm but tell you sometimes have to take my glasses off three down you're not wearing glasses have contacts and actually I don't know so you don't wear contacts are glasses Idaho bull who else why won't give it a few more years anyway\nThat's what I've been hearing for years [laughter]\nThey're starting to go that make you feel better yeah that makes me feel much better fires fine print can be tough yes\nUh again folks that me this email questions to John at the word I'm up that come out there and so let's just kind of generally talk here we're coming up to the year end really were were you know we're almost now I Will we are in the fourth quarter and we've got 'em all sorts of uh corporations right now are reporting earnings out there\nAnd it's been a an additional a bit of volatility out there are there is always opportunity for folks out there if they're working closely with their advisor or during periods of volatility possibly either to take some profits off the table\nOr depending on your length of time that you have to invest\nOr maybe even buying more uh uh some of the holdings that you have to take advantage of these little steps if you've got the cash available\nAnd that's a difficult thing for a lot of people are because markets going down and and it it's almost like if you're in Vegas and they're banning and you're losing and losing and losing and you'd go well I gotta win comment about more right\nUh but it's a little different in the stock market right because uh you're investing for the long term whereas in Vegas you're going for the quick hit here just rent trying to make the quick you\nKnow profit and hopefully leave the table if if you do hit it big\nAh which most people do right there is some underlying value supposedly in equities are [laughter] exactly right but what my point was Darren is is for those out there maybe who\nUm do you do get a little nervous or did get a little nervous during this period of volatility there are options for them because most often times your portfolio may have some winners and you may have some losers within the portfolio\nSo if you're thinking about making some type of a change or we balance of the portfolio you might be able to take advantage of some of the winners\nAnd also offset some of those gains by selling some of the losers\nRight right and a lot of situations we talked about as good as your end starts getting closer and closer harvesting your losses right and what we mean by that is just you can offset capital loss was against the capital gains righto if you do have a lot of games and your portfolio if you have a even if you think you've got some mutual funds that are going to throw off\nSome capital gains ride distributions um it's it's not a bad time to start thinking about re allocating your portfolio and offsetting taking some of the ... the waffles off the table and maybe re allocating that portfolio\nKind of counterintuitive when you think about it down when you're saying take some of harvest some of the law says because most people want to harvest the gains they want to see the wrap it in a lock and again remember folks if you've got some holdings at you you you have in your portfolio that you really love and you've got some gains in those\nUh yeah you can sell them and you can you can lock in the game but there is a rule out there that says you can't go right away and buy back into that that holding and just to take advantage of those gains and and uh you know\nAs a short or long term game right\nThat right yeah well and so what you can do you watch sales are are a big deal right you can you know sell a stock it all off and then buy back down and so there are some rules that you have to worry about 'em you know what what I see a lot of clients doing is managing through their portfolio\nLooking at the gains that they've got a lot of losses they sell those positions\nRight so and and not just a simple way to do it while you're not going to go right back in ... next week but it thirty days as it is that the the it's the ... yeah the wash laws are All right so folks if you did do something like that you could thirty days later if you liked that position you want to buy back in again you feel it's the right time now you can't\nSo that's a strategy that oftentimes people can use\n'em should you use it I don't know we need to certainly sit down and talk about that for most people\nRight in and gains don't have to wash washes only deal with laws are washed feels only deal with laws laws not with gained that's hard\nTo say that is hard to say there's there's music there staring cigarettes cigarettes cheap pattern hydro thanks so much for being with us and I asked her how to adjust our folks are going to get in touch with Darren or any of the gas we have on the show you can
