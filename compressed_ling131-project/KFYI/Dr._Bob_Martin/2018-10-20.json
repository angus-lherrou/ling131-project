{"station": "KFYI", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dr. Bob Martin", "month": "10", "state": "AZ", "day": "20", "content": "Being of course when you start adding additional sources of income such a Social Security or maybe any pension income that you may be entitled to you know that could certainly change\nOr move the needle from attacks basis so we just want to sit down and look at all those moving parts and decide collectively which and maybe it will be a combination of both stripes uh but you know looking at those those types of accounts and looking at and talking with the CPAs that are the folks work with to make sure we're we're\nAsking all those questions in deciding which is going to be the best avenue to go down\nYou know mark or something called you know I mean there's all sorts of names you to put to it but bracket to creep as it might be in other words uh currently the tax code has a number of different brackets tax brackets\nAnd depending on your income you fall within range in a bracket right so it's very possible that depending on where you're taking money from the um the tax\nA status of that money may create you to creep into the next tax brackets therefore paying a much higher rate of taxes so we want to understand that and if you had the availability to pull money from\nA non taxable account or to an account that would be taxed at a lower rate maybe a capital gains rate rather than an ordinary income tax rates that might make the difference\nOf saving thousands of dollars a year in taxes\nAnd and as you know I Do a lot of planning with veterans litter yes you know in their seventies and eighties and a lot of times I deal with those that are still married\nAnd a lot of times when one is in in a care situation and the other one is just living independent healthy\nUm a lot of times we can do some planning around that where we can use right the expense of let's say the the the spouse in this case was in an assisted living type of arrangement I'm In large part a lot of that expense can be a tax deduction\nAgainst income and so in many cases it's more advantageous to pull money is from a retirement account or has a lot of ... a lot of that money could be coming out\nI Know what the CPAs blessing of course a that money could\nBe coming out relatively tax free right so we look at all those options and see if we can't find ways to maximize those distribution here's a story that just occurred to with another Klein of mine has done are were you in every year folks you know we usually do a at a minimum a annual review with the client depending on what their financial situation is but we\nWe pulled the client and then we're talking this week and of course in this particular case the individual turned Seventy this year and will be Seventy and a half as of December [noise] now that means of course that this individual needs to take a what's called the required minimum distribution from their retirement accounts\nSo what we did is we did a quick analysis of the value of the portfolio and what that minimum required amount would be a and we understood what we had to take\nAnd we also understood that for for this year mark there's that little caviar for the first year that you would have a required distribution which is that you can take that require distribution in the year following\nThe actual uh require distribution is require right so in this case if that individual had to take the distribution in two thousand sixteen because it's the first one meaning just turned seven and a half they can push that out next year\nHowever um we want to understand the game with attacks ramifications are going to be of this because I was talking to this individual still working age Seventy fantastic\n[noise] still contributing to four one K. a healthy being able to do all that and then and I asked the questions are you planning on retiring what what's going on with your financial life what are you thinking here\nAnd he was saying maybe I might retire next year I said okay well if you're gonna retire next year that means you're going to give up that hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income that you're earning isn't that true and he said well yes I said well what if we waited to take that require distribution till next year\nBecause if you're not going to have that hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income will maybe we'll take that R and D that distribution and we're going to lower your tax a tax rate on that\nUh so that really made a big impact because his distribution was going to be about Fifteen thousand dollars\nSo the difference of maybe a Fifteen Percent tax bracket versus a twenty five percent tax bracket markets thousands of dollars and all that if he took it and this year he probably just put it in the bank 'cause he wouldn't need it they need it he was he had exactly right he didn't need the money\nBut of course we were required to take it even though we don't need it now remember that folks that's critical and and here's a situation where he has a four O. one K. he still working still contributing to it\nAnd mark as you and I know if if you still working in a participant in four one K. plenty even if you're Seventy and a half or Seventy two or Seventy five or eighty five if you're still participating in that plan you do not need to take required minimum distributions from the plant and again that was something he was not aware of\nUh so we were able to discuss that as well knowing that that was not going to need to be part of the calculation for the required minimum distribution\nYeah one of the things I like to a conversation about clients is it I mean you probably have a similar thing a lot of our clients are taking that money out of their retirement accounts like IRAs and all four one K. is in such only because I have to ... and they go well gosh I'm doing it because I'm they'll all be penalized otherwise I like to have those conversations where we can you know if we're\nGonna have to do it anyway reallocate yeah maybe we don't take those monies and leverage that into something else where it's going to be more impactful\nTax wise in the future or maybe part of a legacy plan to maybe do some sort of planning with maybe use of life insurance if you're healthy enough to make sure we can leave the tax free benefit dollars to the next generation of fire tea or whomever yeah\nUm and that's a real a interesting conversation for a lot of folks out there so we love I Love having that conversation would be now you're talking to mark because right we're taking time after tax dollars now and we're able to place those are in or I should say before tax dollars when you contributed those\nNow became taxable when you took the distribution but now re allocating those assets into a plan that ultimately would be tax free for your beneficiaries whether that your spouse\nOr whether that's your children your grandchildren are as you mentioned maybe a a charity of your choice\nOr so boy all sorts of options for folks but again\nUntil you sit down with an educated and experienced financial advisor folks a lot of those things may not ever come to light for you so I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to sit down and talk with us here at our from Grand Canyon planning happy to do that

percent more drug ads or going into your\nEyes and into your brain than in two thousand twelve\nAnd of course the costs associated with the purchase of pharmaceuticals continue to rise I mean people are complaining about the cost\nOf drugs prescription drugs\nThat they are bankrupting people and they are and the cost keeps going up and up there was a promise that we would rein in those costs they continue to go up and up why is why are they going up\nWhen you can go to an order these things and other countries for a lot less [laughter] and I've heard all the arguments oh no they're not pure wrong a pharmaceutical companies blame increasing drug prices on the high cost of research and development it's so much\nBut yet that's the big lie\nYou gotta realize this is not about a ... research

consumed copious amounts of junk food growing up ah you know it just it ... the eating well it was just not a focus in our family a brushing our teeth was not a focus\nEverybody adventures I mean it was it was a sad situation when I look in the review of me I Love my family but it's just that was not the consciousness\nAnd you know I'm trying to impart something very different or I did for all my children they are all grown up now but that's what a knowledge does for you\nAll right so children pastor parents for junk food reason discovered this was out at the University of Liverpool and it makes perfect sense to me in this day and age\nChildren who spend more than half an hour on line a day are almost twice as likely to pass through their parents and grandparents for junk food that's what a new study out suggests\nThose who spend more than three hours a day on computers tablets and smartphones were more than four times as likely to spend their pocket money on junk food\nAs those with limited screen time\nThese youngsters are almost eighty percent more likely to be overweight or obese according to research conducted by researchers at the University of Liverpool and cancer policy Research Center\nExperts say the findings add to growing evidence that junk food marketing is helping to fuel rising levels of childhood obesity and are obese child is very likely to become an obese adult and when that happens you increase your risk of a multiple\nAmount of cancers a heart disease stroke high blood pressure diabetes\nAnd a whole long list of other diseases that are associated with being overweight\n[noise] this is putting these children at far higher risk of Thirteen types of cancer in later life including breast ball in a ... cancer so\nImage on this just for a moment focus on this for a minute unless you're driving a car close your eyes your you know you think you're doing your grandkids and your shoulder and a favor by giving them junk food whether it's at the drive up window or in the form of candy and other junk food\nEach time you do that and this is not designed to be a guilt trip I'm reading the news don't shoot the messenger each time you do that and if you and once in a while I don't think it's a big deal but when it's done on a regular basis\nIt far and away increases the risk of Thirteen different forms of cancer later in life and that's the last thing a parent or grandparent would ever want to do to their children or grandchildren\nChildren who spent more than a half hour on line today are almost twice as likely to pass through their parents for junk food that's what the study says\nAnd uh you know so the the take away their is yeah they're going to be wanting something because they're going to see it and they're going to be marketed that you offer up through the one thing that we were able\nTo help corral that is you put a grapes in the a freezer and you freeze grapes your freeze black grapes you freeze the green grapes you freeze the um the red grapes and you give it to them when they're frozen\nIt's like eating frozen little balls of popsicles you're going to trick them that's okay though it's for all the right reasons and they are going to get the nutrients they need out of the grapes\nLots of nutrients and they're not going to get the refined sugar and the junk that these companies that sell the junk food
