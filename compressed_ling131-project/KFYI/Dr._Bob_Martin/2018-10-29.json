dot com [laughter] All right\nNext hour we're going to start off the conversation about flu shots so very controversial study has hit the news wire 'em and according to a study published in clinical infectious diseases\nNot only did influenza vaccine not provide any additional protection against the flu virus or in so many years for somebody ...\nSo here's the latest information on flu shots or the influence vaccine this is not me saying this is a prestigious medical journal publishing it flu shots cause eight five hundred and fifty percent increase in the risk of developing a respiratory infection\nWhen it makes sense and just think about this from it wouldn't make sense to undergo a vaccine for cancer if it meant exposing yourself to other forms of cancer by five hundred and fifty percent well of course not\nReducing the risk of contracting one illness only to heighten the risk of multiple others are simply illogical\nAnd yet that is exactly what the flu vaccine does now personally I've never had a flu shot I won't ever have a flu shot but it's your prerogative and your right to choose whether to have one and if you choose to have one um I'll support that if you choose not to all support it\nYour choice of your body now researchers in Hong Kong have conducted each true vaccinated verses unvaccinated study on the influenza vaccine this is probably the one uh one of the few\nIf not the only true study conducted in recent times where a real placebo was actually used in compared to the influenza vaccine\nThe results are quite remarkable people receiving the flu vaccine the influenza vaccine suffered from other respiratory infections at a rate of five hundred and fifty percent more than those people who didn't get anything they got the placebo they got the dummy shot\nThe author absurdity a vaccination science has revealed in this study ladies and gentlemen it claims a flu vaccine results in less disease risk because it causes antibodies to develop\nIn spite of not reducing the likelihood of contracting the disease\nAnd also resulting in a five hundred and fifty times that increase incidence of similar diseases you just gotta look at the science and not be a a sheep all in your head just because your doctors telling you to do this or your friends are telling you to do this or a loved one is telling you to do this\nDo the due diligence that I have and others happened you know what I ... if you know what I Know you do what I Do\nThe seasonal try being let flu vaccine is according to clinical infectious disease this is a study published in clinical infectious diseases this is a medical journal they say five and a half times more incidents of respiratory infections that's five hundred and fifty percent by the way\nThe study is particularly noteworthy because it is a double blind placebo controlled trial and the researchers used sailing solution a genuinely inactive placebo\nAs a stand in for the try valence\nFlu vaccine those are three combined of of you know prevailing sort of soda or organisms microbes most vaccine trials utilize active placebos which are substances that including ... used in the vaccines making the studies meaningless though\nThis fact is almost never revealed in the right up so you kind of hold it back so people don't know about\nOne of the lead researchers out of the say and I quote there is no statistical significance difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between recipients of this tribe valence influenza inactivated vaccine or a placebo\nAnd this researcher goes on to say the flu vaccine provides no benefit not me saying hey I'm biased I get it I Am completely biased against flu vaccines because I've read way too much I think about it well not way too much just enough to decide on ever have one\nNow is take a look at another a respiratory illness that people were more likely to contract as a result of being vaccinated for influence or the flu rhinovirus is the common cold\nSo it isn't any big deal most people get over the common cold however if you develop something called ... virus or echo virus they are quite different both of them are known to cause meningitis paralysis hepatitis and even heart disorders and guess what if\nYou took last year's influenza vaccine or flu vaccine you are more susceptible this year to a weakened immune system and the next year if you take one you're going to be weak there too\nBut there's plenty of options\nYou got an option I mean we can sit here and talk about problems but it would be terrible for me not to give the options the options are the same as they always were\nStay away from sick people ah don't you know touch things and bring things up to your nasal cavity your eyes and your mouth and your ears because that's how the germs are spreading germs can spread somebody sneezes the sneeze and the germs can flow\nAt a Ninety miles per hour speed and could go as much as thirty feet in distance so run when somebody sneezes if you're around somebody is\nAnd to prevent besides you know hand washing your hands and all the other stuff getting plenty of sleep staying high during all of the things that everybody knows by now you should be taking vitamin D during the holiday season\nSomewhere around two to five thousand international units per day vitamin D you should also take additional vitamin C\nThere's a supplement that ah they've talked about last year uh ABC News medical corresponded Jennifer asked and\nSaid hey the flu vaccine last year was a bus but here's what you could do safely and naturally and she recommended one of the things you recommend it was oregano we talk about a regular on his radio show future farms oregano was Rosemary\nIf you take that those
