Hope that you did thousands and thousands of people uh responded and read these post and if you weren't around let me just tell you in brief what they were about number one\nWe learn this last week a major article came out about opioids related to insurance companies\nPossibly being responsible in part to the fueling of the opioid crisis not remember last year\nIt's been documented that around Seventy two thousand people died as a result of opioid overdose or some type of reaction adverse reaction to opioids pain killing drugs\nSeventy two thousand and the problem just seems to not go way it's been building over the years\nA largely in part as a result of four or five people who end up on a other street drugs associated with their first dose of opioids\nBegan in a doctor's office MDs prescribing an over prescribing them and hospitals but this was about insurance companies indirectly\nIn ever in wherever they can\nAnd not covering and not accepting the theory that other things can be done to help many of these people but not all\nWith pain that they're having with safe and effective treatments such as acupuncture and chiropractic and botanical when homeopathic medicine mind Body Medicine in other ways other mode allergies that are safe non drug treatments in the plight against\nHelping people\nIn pain the insurance companies don't cover these things they dissuade people from them and they drive 'em right into the evil pet of\nUnnecessary opioid\nPrescription drugs and then I lead that into a commentary related to three very important things that need to occur to help stem the opioid crisis epidemic of deaths in the u._s.\nWhich was in large part started by doctors\nAnd we've heard comments from Chris Christie former Governor Chris Christie on this ad nauseam we've done a lot on the show any way to get an opportunity to read that you can all you have to do is become my Facebook friend and I'd be auditor for you to do that\nAnd it's all available through my website a Dr Bob dot com go over to Dr Bob dot com deal CPR Bob dot com and scroll down to Facebook become a friend there was another article also on they're related to\nRefined sugars making children violent and more likely to abuse alcohol or smoke cigarettes and energy drinks being one of the worst offenders\nAnd a very interesting and controversial\nA topic about how if you feed children on a regular basis nothing but junk food in the form of candy and ice creams they are more likely\nTo be violent more likely to become abusive to alcohol and become alcoholics more likely\nTo smoke cigarettes and other drugs just by the exposure early and often to eating sugar or how many bags of Halloween jumped sugar will you purchase and dispense this year\nWas the question that I posed on that site now that talked a lot of people off because they were in that mode because Halloween is just around the corner\nIn fact one one of the people that responded to it that took umbrage with the concept of children eating tons of sugar and junk food and being more likely to be violent and abusive of alcohol and tobacco\nOne of the uh responders and I'd I value it and I certainly encourage the responses and I won't give her full name her name is Jana she responded by saying\nSay something goes wrong which it usually doesn't I I can count on one hand the hundreds of them that I have supervised the only thing that really wrong as somebody gets a little older the stomach but it's it's a highly safe thing especially when you compare\nIt to the anesthesia that is involved with gall

this televised story and how and why we can actually drive our own uh the Longevity Project\nWell here's the idea of\nMost Americans take a multivitamin and certainly a a supplement your users it's it's a very high in eighty Ninety percent of some of the studies now the idea was this we know and we've known over the last twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen Years as we track the\nResearch coming out on particular nutrients any auction in spite of nutrients and how they impact the straight delayed the telomeres and so we we felt that my ... my my colleague Professor Jean Berko from the Huntington university to help scientists the concept was look\nPeople are already taking a multivitamin so let's create a multivitamin that's really choice for a century because the concept really hasn't changed with the multivitamin over the last eight years eighty plus you\nGet new ingredients or what have you but the concepts the fame it's like a filling the the the the the the gaps a wellness kind of product this televised is not that we're we're into a whole new area of nutrition ... so we can use nutrients and\nNatural ingredients to impact your chromosomes telomeres DNA\nSo what we did was we we searched out the absolute best ingredients with the best research in human clinical research on lately telomeres so we came up with fourteen ingredients and combinations of ingredients that way than your telomeres\nPack them into a multivitamin into three pills a day three small pills a day\nAnd so the idea is swap that old school multivitamin this product will deliver it impact on your health and longevity that not only know what the multivitamin has or Ken but any other product that talked about is you know I've been in the electric cars\nGames since Nineteen eighty two and I worked with their peers and said to show up in the office or this is a phenomenal ... life extension which launched this whole thing and we've been looking at and and and I've been attracted to many

children should not be given these decongestants because there there's no proof they work\nAnd yet you have doctors bragging about the healing art of medicine always right never wrong nobody else nothing else works\nThey simply have had no prove they've never had prove that they work yet they went ahead with it\nIt's unsafe that's what experts without saying\nAnd think of the millions of people who have been subjected to this poison in these decongestants on the children who have been maimed or have died from them that's what we call the science of modern medicine FDA approved\nResearchers argued drug use to relieve blocked noses should never be given to children under the age of six years of age and only given rarely and with caution to children twelve years and under\nChildren should instead be told that their symptoms will get better over time in other words the chain sure of time do nothing be safe\nYet that's not how it's happened for many families who have been touched by this ill advised recommendation it's been going on for decades and millions of people most\nColds are caused by viruses which can't be treated\nA but cared really by themselves in

sure you're getting plenty of rescue stay hydrated you take nutritional supplements jello pacing the healing process give it the raw materials that needs to\nGather enough energy for the immune system to work as best you can work\nAnd if decongestant drugs don't work on children the question becomes do they really work on adults like you should you be taking the same drugs these decongestants these nasal uh drugs to open you up\nHow can they not work on children and yet they claimed to be working on adults I question that\nWhat is known about nasal decongestant drugs for blocked nasal passages and stuffed up noses is they may cause\nAnd here are just some of the side effects of this class of drugs high blood pressure drowsiness seizures anxiety dizziness tremors stomach problems insomnia headaches rebound Oh yes here it is rebound\nWhen you take these drugs what is rebound well rebound you guessed it is that the same class of drugs which are earmarked for congestion causes\nDrum roll please causes stuffy nose and blocked noses so that's one of the side effects that you can expect from taking decongestants you get congested\nWow that's what I call science children suffer around six to eight colds per year the researchers said while adults around two to four\nOne of the easiest ways to catch a cold is true someone sneezing on you droplets produced by a sneeze can travel at Ninety
