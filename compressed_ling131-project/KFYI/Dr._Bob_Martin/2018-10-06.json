{"year": "2018", "station": "KFYI", "show_name": "Dr. Bob Martin", "month": "10", "state": "AZ", "day": "06", "content": "It was as if you put a new bathroom in or if you put an addition on your house guest what your property taxes are going up folks right because the value of the property went up there is going to be a up you're going to pay for that\nAnd so there's this affidavit of real property that you execute as well and that's basically you're you're now that's going to be recorded there's a lot of things that go into a sale but if you do a quick to slide under the under the you know kinda door sale to mom or dad or to sister brother son or daughter\nSometimes a lot of these pieces don't properly get done right and you don't necessarily have a clear title either in many cases damned people do what's called the quick claim deep\nUh and oftentimes a quick claim that basically it there could be loans on the property there could be um cloud done the title but I'm quick climate to you I don't have the problem anymore now you take you inherit the problem right so you might get a property for less than what you perceive their true market value is but there could be some other headaches that come with that so\nUsually it makes sense for you to use the title company even in a situation when it's a closely related party they are selling it to the ... a lot cleaner yeah\nIt's kinda like buying a used car right or use curry Europe there you're buying advances right you know what I'm saying entire and you've got to be careful on those\nYeah so again so when we come to this point of okay I sold it for less than they are into a related party now all of a sudden I Can't take that deduction I Can't take a ... you still have to report\nIt on your tax return so you're going to show with the title company even though the whole issue a a ten Ninety nine a sort of government knows what you sold it for ... if you don't report anything you've got a problem because on the Ira doesn't understand what the basis was to begin with right\nBut the problem is you can't record again so again in that situation your tax return actually shows two hundred thousand dollars of cost sold it for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a chosen fifty thousand dollar loss\nBut you got to make sure that you identify it as a reward later party seal so the last us not you know through to return\nRight and now and the other side of the coin there and you've got the person who bought it\nAnd now the person who bought it for fifty thousand dollars say less than what the market value as\nA ... immediately they've got a fifty thousand dollar appreciable gain there\nAnd if they're going to be using it for personal residents I guess there's a benefit versus if they're going to be using it for an investment property there could be some potential additional tax obligations that the buyer may have in the future as well because it costs basis sell though is that correct that's correct so again folks\nBefore you do something like this just like anything when you have a financial transaction make sure you talk to a professional you should probably be talking to your CPA about this you should be talking to your\nReal estate professional or maybe a title company as I mentioned how do you transfer this property and there are some legal issues when it comes to this is well you don't want to touch base with a a a real estate attorney as well just to make sure that\nYour idea maybe sounded maybe find it may be perfectly fine but just understand all of the ramifications of what you're trying to accomplish and make sure that you're not going to have any surprises\nYou know a year from now two years from now three years from now if the Irish comes knocking on your\nDoor because they're looking at a tax return from three years ago\nA and they're saying well wait a minute you owe us you know Seventeen thousand dollar share right over the number is\n... and you can also have some some challenges there might be some better ways of doing it from an estate planning right on point yeah rather than selling it or gifting it over to the parents so exactly right or a lot of issues to look at but just be careful yeah just be careful but you're right there are some ways to do it to a state planning as well\nDarren I'm just real quickly got a short period of time left in the segment\nAny other thoughts on maybe a business owner is out there because this is a big one business owners have some\nUh a little extra flexibility when it comes to deductions versus just the general population who work for a company and on their home and that's it right they don't have necessarily additional deductions and write offs or what what do you have said maybe that's one little thing out there that may be business owners are missing oftentimes at UC\nWell there's actually two that come to my mind right off the number one\nIs we're in the fourth quarter ... if you don't have a retirement plan someplace start thinking about I'm ... I'm because most of them you have until the end of the year to put those in place right I'm a number two with the new tax law um you can write off for a majority of your costs with not all of them on the purchase of\nOf assets ripe and equipment mhm and that's that's a substantial amount now right ... definitely something to consider folks again if you're looking uh for some consultation when it comes to your tax planning whether it's financial or for your business or it's a individual down ...\nAs you can get down to information from our website at Grand canyon planning dot com or any of the guess we have on the show and thanks for being with us as always for having them John ... this is the word on wealth always here with you each and every a weekend\nJust talking some financial talking

out of time\nUh and my uh people that are that follow me there ... they ... engaged big time to the point of thousands and thousands engaged in a lot of comments some of which were pretty harsh somewhere very funny\nWhat am I talking about caffeine and sugar or barley and hops\nWell it has to do with a very serious topic of the cabinet or a vote which is coming up very shortly here and by the way if that vote rapes during the show until twelve noon\nWe will go to a live you don't have to go anywhere stay right where you are you don't have to have one ear on the television this morning in one ear\nOn the radio so that you don't miss anything we will go live to the cabinet or a vote the hearings or if it breaks during my segment right up until twelve noon today back to what I'm Talking about with caffeine in sugar versus barley and\nHops did you notice and this is the very first thing I noticed like I said my wife\nWhen a doctor Blasey Ford was testified in front of the panel I said\nLook at that Coca Cola cans sitting on that table have you ever seen that before usually there's water bottles but there's never anything commercial there if you can recall ... and their sits a can of\nFizzy colored sugar water with caffeine in it I mean what was that worse to the Coca Cola company that was like a hundred million dollar prop sitting there it was\nAnd I was so surprised that it wasn't noticed by other forms of media but it caught my attention because it was grotesque that's why\nI mean it was just saying drink coke I mean that's what it is that's why you have perhaps that's where you have commercials we see those props they're paid for big time big Janeiro occurs when you see a can of anything in any movie\nOr any car or anything else everything's bought and paid for and I'm sitting there wondering\nTo myself who allowed that Coca Cola can to come into that chamber and be placed right in plain view in front of the entire world was that works I mean could you even place a value\nOn that but that's beside the point ah [noise] and then uh we heard [laughter] that beer is good I drink beer I like beer I have beer and all that\nNow I'm not trying to and it's really a kind of touchy for a lot of people to even go into this subject and people will yeah I mean I over the years during usually presidential campaigns will discuss the health habits the diet in some of the behaviors associated with\nA presidents and presidential campaigns from eating jelly beans to peanuts to pork rinds and know broccoli I mean just right down the line and when I Do and when it's related to\nOr something associated with health and I try to tie it into people go crazy on it they believe that\nOr I started talking about uh the fact that somebody drinking a Diet Coke all day long Eighteen cans of it\nOr or maybe they fainted because they have some seizure disorder I mean whenever it happens people immediately say okay so you're a Democrat or Republican I Know it I'm done with you and therefore I purposely try to shy away from that I I Try to avoid it\nSo that we don't lose about half of our audience bought it doesn't always work out that way and sometimes\nAh my bad and in this case I just couldn't resist it when I saw that coke cat on that table in front of Dr Ford that was\nIt just it just took me over the top and then when I heard about a beer or it's just that was that was it I saw it in there it is there's the ballots there's ... there's the union the yang there's the speed and there's a downer which do you choose step right up\nOf course referring to where people are with respect to believing Dr Ford or judge Kavanaugh oh\nWe viewed that Coca Cola cat on that table and I also have pictures of her drinking it go to my website you'll see it\nUh and of course a doctor a judge Brett Kavanaugh as well it's there and man what a ... action my Facebook people had to that and the comments were outrageous I mean amazing comments too so\nI guess uh what I'm trying to tell you as you missed out on that if you're a not a Facebook friend of mine a and also there was something very interesting to\nMost Googled health problems in your state a new study\nUh by a this big health plan has revealed the symptoms that are searched in Google Dr Google of course in every state\nAnd there's a big graph of it right there on my Facebook page and it says how many people for example in a given state a Google stress or nasal congestion or sweaty palms or irritability your stomach aches or I BS irritable bowel syndrome or sleeplessness et cetera et cetera\nAnd each state had symptoms that we're over the top I Want you to check it out it's all there and of course previews of what we're going to be talking about on this radio show

coming up\nThat's going to be getting into a topic that we all need to listen very carefully about and we'll get to the topics were going to be discussing today both here on Saturday and our nation wide show which begins right back here tomorrow afternoon starting at five o'clock and we hope you are with us to hear that because\nWe have a lot to talk about in fact one of those topics is hugs and how hugs Ari protection against physical and mental illness and after the vote I think some people are going to need some Huck Finn some people want to get ...\nOn a victory dance we'll get to that

arthritis and ...\nYou see you name it they see it and they get tremendous results even after medic of typical standard medicine even though they believe in it and understand that uh have failed ... medical center check out their patience telling their story of treatment\nIll their illness and the recovery on their website it's sun ridge medical dot\nCom son ridge medical dot com or\nThat's what I'm all about my weekends are like ... year Monday and Tuesday on a Saturday and Sunday but I enjoy it I'm here by choice I Love it I Love helping sick people get Whelan well people stay that way right now that let's get to why you're here today a doctor houses look\nLet's begin with a you know I discovered because you called me some time ago and said look\nI'm On another mission Dr Bob I ah I realized that America is completely addicted hooked on\nObsessed with and in fact with every swallow\nThey may be doing something that they regret especially if they stop it and the headaches come and the nervousness into jittery and has come under sleeplessness is they're all these things that happen when people try to override their tiredness first thing in the morning and they throw back some type of a you know energy drink\nOr or a cup of coffee or whatever it may be and that's where we lead to the subject of my till moon go what the heck is I don't mind go let's begin their doctor do\nYou go it is my two months ago and the parent ... which is a key you know it depends on what part of the world you're from kids the body's ability to take energy and and have it float through info out as opposed to becoming block\nSo that's what my keys dance for a month ago is actually a name that we came up with out of frustration\nA almost a year ago and we have now reached the stage where we're going to actually be changing that name here very quickly um but it was just a way of trying to distinguish ourselves and and be something different than what is out there because as you just hit the nail on the head\nUm this country is addicted to sugar and one thing that you left out that just came out this last week as well is that taking these artificial sweeteners destroy the intestinal Flora and the guts\nThat's also another serious serious complication that can grow in size and eventually lead to these conditions known as you're about clones a sluggish elimination at the very least which leads to just a whole lot of different problems across the board um everybody knows about these so called mid afternoon slump in energy between the hours of two and six\nAnd that's simple when you go and do these artificial energy drinks are in the morning time or whenever whatever goes up artificially is going to come crashing down in the afternoon and that's what I have now dedicated a twenty four seven to trying to bring to market to let people understand that there is in fact\nA different way to get energy without having to have any develop dating effects and that is my mom go my I don't mind go is not an energy drink\nIt is mitochondrial support and what is ... everybody may I ask my ... is the energy producing portion of every cell in your body\nAnd the toxicity that we're living in right now in this environment is causing our mitochondria to not be able to be maintained giving the body and ability to maintain and and create energy\nAnd so as a consequence of when we came out with this formula the state back with similar to what was in my practice and that everybody who takes an ounce of this in the morning whether you're young or old\nUm experiences a gentle and I emphasize the word gentle Lipton energy via mitochondrial support along with a noticeable enhanced focus and a sense of wellbeing that can last all day\nAnd you know you tell people this may go wait that sounds too good to be true and yet will do it just take your around and watch a lot of the shows that we've been doing people are walking around they said well we'll have around now and if it does what you say will be back\nAnd we are very very fortunate to have that happen people go and walk around and then they come back and say wow that stuff is pretty amazing let's get some more of it\nAll right so you just unpack a lot of stuff folks there's only one person that talks faster than me that started cleaning house you can tell so both of us are to you know quadruple AAA and even though we're right now actually trying to slow or sells now it's just hard to when your mitochondria are packed full of fight 'til chemicals not to other things that are undesirable\nYou know you brought up an important point Dr ... and looking at is\nThe average American foreign away the biggest percentage of Americans start out there day\nIn a liquid assault with a stress a response chemical that they're drinking down that they don't realize it's unleashing the same response as though if somebody in a dark alley was chasing them with a knife that wanted to do harm on them\nThat's the response that they would have their body would produce copious amounts of stress hormones coming out of their adrenal glands to get their muscles activated to activate glucose and all these other chemical process seas so that they would run fast and get away from harm\nYet we're doing the exact same thing first thing in the morning when you drink a glass of any kind of an artificial as you pointed out energy drink\nThat's laced with a central nervous stimulant called caffeine or they take in their latte or where whatever their coffee in the morning\nThey are doing the exact thing that would happen in an alley a dark alley where somebody's chasing you trying to do harm to you the same response is occurring and it's occurring very quick\nAnd ladies and gentlemen whatever goes up fast must come down fast doctor who I was in blue just alluded to it and the problem with that is once in a while you can get away with that I mean you know okay so you're ... you know you're out on the highway you're driving across the country\nAnd you're you're saying okay I Need to get to a from point a to be in the next Eighteen hours and I need to stay awake\nAnd I don't want to hurt myself or others so I'm going to take some caffeine I'm going to take some uppers and some direction I get that\nBut to do it every day to go to work or to function or read the newspaper\nYou're going to run down that alley away from that a person is trying to hurt you by doing that to your physiology there are consequences to that it's slow it's insidious but it happens\nWe're going to talk about more of that when we come back from this break and give you options which is the most important thing how can you feel better function better perform better and have nots me odd energy but actually real energy that you drive real foods\nWill get to that and the pay off with Dr Glenn houses and flip when we come back from this break stage you and you're listening to the doctor Bob margin show on news
