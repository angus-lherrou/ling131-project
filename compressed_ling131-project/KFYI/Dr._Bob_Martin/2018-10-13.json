{"station": "KFYI", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dr. Bob Martin", "month": "10", "state": "AZ", "day": "13", "content": "Maybe at sixty two are sixty three about three years one of the things you might want to consider doing in most companies will allow you to do this it depending on the plan is contribute to a health savings account if you can contribute to a health savings account Chris for the next two three four years you might be able to build up enough in that health savings account\nTo cover the cost of the premiums for years up until the age of sixty five so it could be a a solution to this if you could plan a little ahead\nAnd the health savings accounts it's a fantastic vehicle right\nAnd it gives you a lot of opportunities to save for your health on a tax free basis right because you get through the doctor mhm and then I don't want to play ... from whereas it with my CPA a that it's it's tax deductible right and the nice thing is that it's meant for health care costs\nTo me and then if I Believe after the age of sixty five without health savings account could only be used just for health before that right after eight sixty five you can use it for anything\nRight who could actually draw down even ... yeah of course there's going to attacks of all the way it works like an IRA voter myself right so if you're\nGetting to deduct it from your income even if you're contributing to an IRA if you're a buck fifty\nYou could put sixty five hundred dollars into that IRA or if you're contributing to your ... year going to be able to also contribute to a health savings account and reduce\nYour tax liability by doing so and as you mentioned Chris if you're using that money for health issues for health care costs than it's tax free you're able to use it but if you do decide at some point in the future to use it as some type of supplement to retirement or income\nYes you'll have to pay taxes on it just like an IRA so but that's okay I mean if you haven't used it for healthcare tax at some point in time we know that you know so very good All right Chris as far as preparation for the change I Want to talk about preparation for change of employment and this is something I see often were folks come in to us\nBecause they're changing their job and they want to know what their options are ... when it comes to their retirement accounts that they have\nAnd usually it's someone maybe who's fifty fifty five years old now they've been working with the company now for maybe ten Fifteen Years\nAnd all of a sudden there's a change maybe the the company that they're with is downsizing maybe they're changing a focus on something and the team that they were working with is no longer going to be needed and what winds up happening is they\nGet rest right Mm reduction in force\nAnd they get some type of a package possibly but the thought is okay now that I have this what do I do from here we may have a four O. one K. we may have some stock options and we may have some other type of pension plan that's part of this what do we do Chris how does it all has it all work out at that point\nI think we absolutely before you make any decisions on anything I Would certainly asking an offer that opportunity to give us a call\nAnd let's sit down and let's take a review well what are your job options out there are you looking for another job and maybe it's Chris John derive a possibility of retiring right now\nWe have to take a look at those things certainly where below that fifty nine and a half we don't want to necessarily go tapping into those IRAs there are ways to do it right where we don't pay penalties it's certainly a conversation that we can have\nOf how do we stretch you to getting Social Security\nBut we're going to take a look at your four O. one K. app pensions at cash mhm as well as health care and how are you going to maintain health insurance premiums et cetera so I I Would strongly suggested the first thing you do is give us a buzz right come on and bring everything and that shoe box John and let's review\nAnd and see how our plan has changed from you returned sixty two to maybe now at fifty seven or whatever anybody\nAnd and the other thing the other question is is that okay if you've got the employee stock option plan the set plan okay what ... how are you vested in that ... what's the tax liability of of something like that how about the pension is there an opportunity to lump sum out on that pension where they're going to give you the availability of take the lump sum and role that over into an IRA\nThen of course you've got that four O. one K. you had the four o one K which you've been contributing to an oftentimes because what we do find is not only do you have that four one K. but when you come in for the review we find oh there was a prior for a long way to or there's an IRA ... more there is another type of an account out there\nThat all of a sudden we start to look at well how can we consolidate these accounts and make sure that they're all working in our favor to help us now that we have this issue that we're facing of potentially an early retirement or maybe is there that opportunity to get out there and still gain other fair employment and that's probably\nA in many cases what there is crass\nUnfortunately though we're short on time right now we've got to get Lou bite and flew by again All right Chris lots of one of our advisors here at the front of Grand Canyon plenty appreciate it as always ...\nHey folks if you want to get in touch with us

though we are broadcasting live in a row today from beautiful Kailua Kona, Hawaii\nAttending the fortieth anniversary of the Hawaiian I'm a contest\nThe contest that we are invited to each year here the Iron Man contest\nAnd the reason that we get invited here a once a year is to help render care and health advice to one of the leading competitors in the women's professional competition\nAnd we had been taken care of her all week and we're hoping that she does very well she's expected to do very well we've been working with her nutritionally we've been giving are all kinds of other forms of care what she needed badly these athletes are incredible\nWhen you think about what they do they get in the water they swim for two point four miles in the ocean then they ... they get out of the\nOcean and they'd jump on their bicycles their ... their incredible bikes some of them by the way or [laughter] they cost thousands of dollars six thousand to twenty thousand dollars these bikes I mean they\nWere talking about bikes that costs as much as cars it's amazing to me and they bike for a hundred and twelve miles without stopping and and they don't stop between any of these events they go right out of the ocean after swimming as hard as they can\nFor two point four miles they'd jump right on their bikes and the bicycle for a hundred and twelve miles\nThey get off their bikes and then they run as fast as they can for another twenty six point two two miles\nAnd here in the beautiful state of Hawaii there are about twenty five hundred competitors from eighty two countries here being represented\nAnd we are very privileged to be invited here each year and in particular to take care of this top female athlete and now we've been taking care of her all week uh both uh counseling her and giving her advice on her nutritional needs\nShe had a bunch of structural problems which have been levy aided as a result of the care that we gave her she had some problems with a certain glands that or should she should not have\nProblems with because if you do you're not going to win a race and we're just hopeful because I uh I spoke with her or I didn't speak with him about attacks and her husband this morning\nAnd she's feeling good and we're watching her through the race today she's already in the water\nAbout halfway through the swim swimming portion of it and they'll keep me up there but we're not here for that we're here for you today on the radio\nOr because it matters it matters to you and we've got a lot to talk about\nBoth today here on the radio show and then tomorrow we're back on the air right back here starting at five PM tomorrow afternoon as we go nationwide\nAll asked starting at five PM so I Hope you're back with us because we have a special guest plan for a tomorrow's show that I think you're going to be very interested in learning about\nAnd I want you to also stick around if you have children or grandchildren sooner or later they're going to get a buggy knows sooner or later they're going to get congested they're not going to be able to breathe or going to be coughing and snorting and sniffing and you're going to see how I got to get that new ... and I got to get them decongestant\nAnd you think about it and you think okay so I and I take him to the pediatrician or I've just take myself to the drugstore and get them a decongestant because I Want my child to breathe because if they're not breathing I'm worried about it and if they're not breathing and coughing and starting all night long it's going to keep me up some of the ... decongestants and you do that\nAnd you put them at great grave risk the headline we are going to be talking about today don't give children dangerous decongestant drugs or medicines that's what is now being recommended\nBy leading medical health professionals\nAfter decades decades of recommending this stuff it just amazes me how are these things come about and how\nAre these decongestant drugs have many dangerous adverse side effects but yet that was the science of then it's not now how does this change will get into that today here on the show\nNow Dr Boris shorts is in addition to being a colleague of mine and the healing arts he's also a friend of mine\nAnd a doctor Boris a shorts and I go back many many years when he was helping me with the events within the valley the sun that we used to do on a real regular basis\nAnd we went out and did a lot of screenings will now Dr Boris Schwartz is being highly sought after by males from all over the United states who have difficulty with erect out as function\nA you know some other stronger drug oxycontin kowtow and all that but then you set off a whole cascade of other problems so the person that they have to deal with and grapple with\nSo my suggestions you consider a looking into a doctor who can manage this from a cause that have standpoint in other words go after the cause\nFind out what that is and then try to work backwards at fixing whatever that is and if you've got something like this in my opinion the doctors over ... medical center are well equipped\nTo handle this they see these kinds of problems all the time and that's who I Would go to on a professional level meanwhile to man is the inflammatory process I recommend future farm liquid turmeric\nFuture farm liquid turmeric that is as potent as any drug it blocks about six to eight different inflammatory pathways and in his cage deals that need to take a stronger dose per directions because of the extent of his pain\nSo look for

as good as she can be so that she can ... performed her her best\nAnd we wish her well 'cause the contest is going on right now as we speak All right so here it is about decongestants think about how many gallons and how many pills potions and powders had been dumped down\nA children's throats and into their body putting them at great risk these decongestants the doctors have been prescribing because that was science then and it's not now\nAnd the the call to action is don't give children decongestants experts warn block noses stuffy nose drugs don't work\nAnd may be harmful to children especially those that are under twelve and these are the same doctors that claimed that they have all the walk on scientific information that it's safe an FDA approved all these decades they've been recommending decongestants to our children and grandchildren decades' worth and now they don't work\nWhat in the age\nI mean it's it's amazing young children should shouldn't be giving these deep and given these ... a decongestant drugs because there's no proof that they work\nI mean how after all these decades unbelievable not only that they're not safe yeah the employees have been recommending decongestants for use by children for decades well so much for science the science of modern medicine how I'll ladies and gentlemen\nResearchers argue drugs used to ...\nKnocked or stuffy noses should never be given the children under six and only in rare and under caution to children under twelve\nChildren should instead be told their symptoms will get better on their own most colds which these are caused by the stuffy nose in the block knows and the congestion are caused by viruses which can't be treated let me repeat can't be treated\nBut eventually care of themselves and if decongestant drugs don't work on children do they really work on adults\nWhat is known about nasal decongestant drugs for blocked or stuffy noses is they may cause high blood pressure here are some of the potential side effects of these drugs the doctors have been recommending for decades through your children and your grandchildren and you've trusted them\nOr they cause high blood pressure they cause drowsiness they cause seizures they cause anxiety dizziness tremors stomach problems insomnia headaches rebounded you guessed it congestion so they're very drugs had been recommended by the suppose in\nGate keepers of the healthcare system the scientists you know the ones that only\nProvide scientific proof I Love it a those are the ones that have been giving these drugs and these very class a drugs cause rebounded you guessed it congestion which means when you get these drugs enough\nThey will cause the very problem that you're getting the drugs for\nWhat is that a good just and it's true it's not me saying that's what the experts are now finding on this children suffer around six to eight colds per year\nWhile adults about two to for a year\nAnd one of the easiest ways to catch a cold is true of course somebody sneezing on you\nThe droplets that her wafting through the air\nProduced by a sneeze can travel up to Ninety miles per hour and can reach people within thirty thirty\nThirty feet so if somebody sneezes and they're like ten feet away from you be careful you were going to get a shower of nothing that viral droplets unless you're running the other [laughter] ... it's sad it's true but protect yourself\nBy avoiding sick people obviously also do things to make your immune system stronger and better able to protect you from these viral infection like get enough sleep stay hydrated exercise eat well keep your positive mental attitude going on\nAnd take nutritional supplements to help maintain your immune function like vitamin C. vitamin D oregano oil with Rosemary by future far\nAt a food based complete multivitamin like see that with Ninety two different nutrients I just talked about earlier\nYou can also use humidifiers during the fall and winter season because the air gets dry in the nasal cavities get a dried out in the hydrated and that lets viruses get in there because they crack open\nAnd you can also use natural decongestants Sam's containing eucalyptus you can use hot bath steam sauna is for elevating what we call heat shock proteins meeting that's why\nYou see in Germany in Sweden and Finland these European countries where they'll on a regular basis I mean every every house literally has a sauna why\nBecause they have less colds and less infections because they go out in the heat their bodies up that's why we have fevers\nThat's why we have temperature rises in the body because we hate the body up by liberating these proteins called heat shock proteins which elevate the body's immune it's a immunity and leave us less susceptible to these infections\nAnd this research is out of the University of queens in Australia\nA and the University of dent in Belgium\nExposing the problems with these decongestant drugs in the most recent edition of the British medical journal and yet this has been going on in suppose in\nYou know us scientific medicine dumping these drugs down putting our children at peril\nWith these decongestant drops I've never believed in him I have six children and they've never had one decongestant drug in their entire lives they didn't need it we knew natural ways to take care of them and you can learn about this stuff it's all for the learning process\nAnd you can find out about it just like I did is powerful stuff\n[noise] All right now the doctors at sunrise medical center there's the proud sponsors of the doctor by march and show because they get results when other forms of care fail to help seriously sick people [noise]\nNow I realize that a lot of people you know they say well you know I really like my doctor I have\nFaith in my doctor and some people are just flat out brainwashed by the pharmaceutical companies believing that the only path to healing is taking a toxic drug which the average drug has over Seventy different adverse side effect potential [noise]\nA Mike before you actually stop all eyes formulations nail explain it to and maybe there's a staggering formulation that you can do like one week you can see\nThe next where you take your eyes for me the next week you use can see you know what to say something like that rather than a one exclusively or
