twenty five years according to the College Board and now prices were flat they didn't rise seven percent which means of college was going to cost you twenty five grand\nIt's now twenty five grand one hundred as opposed to seven percent increase of thousands of dollars so this is really very exciting news and demonstrating slow but sure\nThat college is becoming more affordable I Believe are going

she works in the kitchen\nAnd while her job in the kitchen typically pays in Boston less than twenty seven thousand dollars a year\nShe earns fifty thousand a year why she making so much money as a kitchen employee\nAt Harvard University because Harvard has a policy that requires service workers to be paid the same pay and benefits as other university employees so she gets a much higher salary

Steven Yes sir\nI have a question about being arrested on mobile called a couple of days ago that told me that I ... my name [laughter] and then returned all within twenty four hours local law enforcement wouldn't be around it yeah\nYeah I'm I'm actually I'm of course not uh although I like returning those phone calls\nOr they're just they're just\nThey're just fun to return now normally a yeah of course it's a scam and no they can't do it and they are in violation of the law and here is the problem you call the authorities and whoever a is a\nUh whoever handles sad that it would probably be\nThe FCC I guess who is in charge of that and why they put in a complaint and then they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a a robocall it was well robo call them a sense of the dialing but I got a live person who I said I I'm with the IRS\nAnd do we have a a ... a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really\nUh yes and we'll take a will take out a check over the phone I Will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take a I tunes card or apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple carts apple to or I chose\nAnyway [laughter] excuse me so what I did is\nI said really a IRS leaning goes absolutely a go once you give me the number of the lean because what are you talking about it I said there's no such thing as an I arrest document that you're holding onto it doesn't have to file number on it so why don't you give me the final number\nOh we're not allowed to do that really\nAnd so I just had a ball with this guy and of course hung up on him and I hate the fact that he called me the bottom line whenever anybody ever makes that kind of a a a threat you just hang up on him I mean he's going to replace\nWide I appreciate your time okay\nRight yeah it's just what robocalls would I just read that fully half of the calls that you weren't going to get are now going to be robo calls that are now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them and it's this whole thing about how I hate people in the hate me\nAnd so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day and I were talking about robocalls I I mean it was I was stunned 'cause I I you know\nYou can easily tell what a robocall is if you even begin to look at it and thinking you're in your mind because normally where you think is is is going is this a robocall once you even asked that question you understand that it is so I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\nIs Mr handle and this is a call\nMr handle and no one was on the other end except some computer armature handle my name is whatever for collection agency and then our hero clunkers you go and the woman says oh excuse me I just dropped my head piece sorry about that uh oh here we go I have my hippies back on again it was a robocall\nThey got me they got me I did not know for the next ten Fifteen seconds until I said hello hello and they now have programs where you know she was me I didn't hear you\nAnd then I started screaming you stupid rich and I'm\nIn by the way that was the least sibling I was calling\nA ... of course they don't have a program to answer that I put it was great fun out robocalls but no the bottom line is if you ... the IRS never makes the phone call\nCollections agencies will and you simply say you stop it you do we do this by mail you're done talking to me they'll call you again and you've heard me say a million times used the magic word harassment\nAlso you can say I've been a which I Love is I'm recording this phone call\nI just want to let you know you staying on the phone call using on the phone with me you're allowing me to record the phone call click\nUnless it is a legitimate collection agency where they're following all the rules say

feet just wanted to tell you that OK okay\nOr in any way later that night her she got extreme pain into\nThe big toe [noise] and I'm\nIn the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work

week\nAgain she missed like six seven days or are we seeing the special if it got worse\nBut at the removed home now and she couldn't go to work again so she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one credit for [laughter] ...\nWell yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up and read a missing two weeks of work or because of a bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's\nNothing there and so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims he's going to hear a small claims a a um ... effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a meta where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the odd person the other side of that if I'm being sued and I run the nails will a shopping today wasn't me that the infection someplace else\nSo I it's one of those and also what

go what did she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so uh she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can\nGuarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has\nA probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down\nA and breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance so that was a thing but yeah when I Would do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and what do you wanna do you want me to to you and see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right\nYeah no I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California\nI shouldn't they carry
