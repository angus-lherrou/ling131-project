the truth about your future that's what it's all about exponential technologies and how they're impacting every aspect of our daily lives\nHere some of the latest and greatest announcements that have recently come out in the field of quantum computing this is the entire next generation of computing Google Microsoft and tell them IBM they're all investing in this or over Seventy prototypes\nAlready the U.S house of representatives just passed a bill the national quantum initiative act\nTo accelerate education research and development they say that the quantum computing can lead to new pathways that will cure cancer explore the universe develop an imagined new materials and solve complexities of our own human biological systems it's really kind of amazing when you think about what's coming

major\nAnd they also have to provide their date of birth and their professional interest and the coffee shop collect the data\nAnd sells it to corporate sponsors who will then reach out to the students through logos and apps and digital ads and screens in the stores in on mobile devices and another are you willing to give away your personal data\nIn exchange for free stuff\nThat's the premise of this coffee shop and it's raising a lot of eyebrows among those in the privacy war\n[noise] meanwhile in the field of medicine at Chicago's start up is now three D printed a human cardiac patch it's a major milestone leading to bio printing fully functioning organs you take a patient's own blood cells you reprogram them into stem cells you'd make the stem cells into a three D. bioengineering\nAnd human heart becomes viable for transplantation\nIs the first time a cardiac patch was bio printed three D. with multiple ... the human heart is made of\nMeanwhile researchers at the University of Oxford department of clinical neurosciences has created the first robotic system that operates on a human ... a robot doing surgery on you or I\nMay insert the robot in to the pupil ... an incision less than one millimeter inside the surgeon than operates the robot via a joystick it eliminates the worry that the surgeons hands might shake or accidentally move or whatever\nThe robot has already been used to conduct two routine procedure is removing a run brain from the retina\nAnd dissolving hemorrhage is under a retina and in both cases the results were better than what human doctors could do\nAt Johns Hopkins scientists have developed an electronic skin that can fit over a prosthetic hand that allows the user to feel sensation including pain\nThrough a prosthetic skin pretty amazing the FDA has now approved of in a system that will assess whether a patient has a disease that might lead to a vision loss it's eighty seven percent accurate and it's the first

three times better than twenty twenty\nHow would you like to have binoculars in your eyes\nOr being able to look as if you're using a microscope that's what has already been created with a by on a contact lens\nThese kinds of innovations and more are going to radically improved quality of life for pretty much everybody on the planet once they reach mainstream production\nSome other a fascinating changes going on in the field of exponential technologies at MIT they've created a wearable interface that knows what you're thinking without you having to say anything out loud it's a white plastic strip and hooks over your ear goes below your jaw\nThe electrodes pick up a neuro muscular signals that are released when you think of a certain word sort of like saying it in your

disability just by thinking they're able to communicate\nIt's amazing what's going on in the field of medicine but it's not just the field of medicine where we're seeing some pretty amazing\nInnovations in the field of robotic scientists of MIT of made a robot that can teach itself to see and identify objects and how to manipulate them as well know robots been able to do this before this robot as capable of picking up an object it never seen before\nAnd without resorting to trial and error it knows what to do with the object that's how humans do it you pick up an object you've never seen before and you know how to pick it up without breaking it you know how to turn it so that you can examine this robots able to do the very same thing\nThis is just a few of the illustrations of what's going on in the field of exponential technologies and how they're going to radically improved and\nAlter every aspect of life that you can think about and that's why we
