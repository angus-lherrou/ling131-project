married couple\nI'm Rick Adelman this is the truth about money triple a plan wreck here's an amazing statistic from the United nations forty percent four zero forty percent nearly half of all births in the United states now occur outside of wedlock\nForty percent of all the babies born in America are born to moms who are not married to the dads by the way that number forty percent in Nineteen Seventy it was ten percent\nThis is a massive change in American society\nAnd I want to ask you about the implications on estate planning one of the legal rights and responsibilities what are you doing about properly naming errors because when you are married you have certain automatic rights under tax law and other federal statutes\nBut when there is no marriage certificate many of those rights\nDon't exist so you need to make sure if you were giving birth to a child to lose\nOther parent you are not married you need to make sure you're talking within the state attorney for the protection of yourself your partner and most importantly the child\nOr taking telephone calls here on the record on the show had not the Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nHi Rick I'm a I'm my question uh uh is actually a market mutual funds um my wife and I are retired we're in her sixties\nUh you know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous but\nUh uh uh just concerned about preserving by uh uh what I've accumulated and I started researching these so called barking neutral fund the four of you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say\nAnd I guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah yeah I appreciate the question about the whole\nName is ... ... of a sales pitch\nIt clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone who is afraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounced themselves as market troll ... one of them or if there's not supposed to mean and the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate\nA neutrality meaning that if the market goes down they're not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's the ... that the sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future\nSo rather than trying to choose a sales pitch that his so called market neutral what we would simply out for instead is diversification in other words\nDon't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there to give you some opportunity to keep pace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money and bonds and you have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nOr does make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money and lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs and foreign securities and government security is an oil and gas and real estate next potential technologies\nAnd on and on and on so that is what we have found to be the best approach or effectively phrase it another way it's not the best approach\nIt's the least worst approach\nUm because what we have really found it's kinda like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is the best way to invest so we choose the least worst which is not making big bats\nSo if you'll simply place a little bit of your money in a large array of investment opportunities you can help insulate yourself\nFrom losing a lot of money at any one time in any one asset class because you don't have all their money in any one after class so that makes sense for it\nThey said yeah totally makes sense and uh you know thank you for talking me out of it uh because uh it didn't make sense to me\nIn any time you come upon other similar kinds of questions just give us a call happy to help\nThanks so much you're very welcome that's Bob from Dana Point California here on the record all been show you can do it he didn't call us a triple a plan wrecked you're doing some analysis on Mitchell funds are you looking at investment opportunities we can be a really good sounding board to help you make sure you don't make a big mistake so let us take a look at your investments\nAnd in fact even better if you help us look at your investments before you buy them\nWe are now offering to provide you a free retirement review just go to Edelman financial dot com slash review I you know if you're trying to figure out the key answer to the one question that is dominant in the retirement planning issue is real simple\nDo I have enough money to retire will I in fact be able to retire in comfort just go to as I said Edelman financial dot com slash review or call us a triple eight plan wreck\nI'm Rick Edelman there's been a lot of conversation on this program and many other places about the fiduciary rule but the obligation of\nFinancial advisors to serve your best interest right now only registered investment advisors firms like Edelman financial are responsible are obligated to act as a fiduciary to our clients stockbrokers do not have this obligation insurance agents do not have this obligation\nWell hero comes along the New Jersey bureau of securities that the state regulator in New Jersey\nThey've now issue to notice that they're going to release the proposal that will in fact require everybody brokers as well as investment advisors to adhere to a fiduciary standard when providing investment recommendations to clients New Jersey's acting they said because federal regulators meaning the SEC\nHaven't done enough to raise the standards and so New Jersey's doing it by themselves does this mean we're going to suddenly the fifty states doing this individual of regulations\nI Hope not I hope we have one over all encompassing regulation at the federal level but in the meantime if you're in New Jersey you're ahead of the curve compared to everywhere else\nAs we close out the show this weekend I Want you to know that our our prayers are with everybody and Florida Georgia the Carolinas now Texas with the flooding there\nThe devastation of these natural disasters or heart wrenching and we really do

area it's so here's an amazing opportunity and I are\nStanding by their story I'm ... Fox News as officials from around the world continue to doubt that now that he's being told by Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalists ... inside the somebody constantly in Istanbul, Turkey Saudi Arabia's foreign minister is defending the kingdom\nHim from ever a practicing\nMedicine they toss them out of the state of Indiana is medical license and that's it you're done you're never going to practice medicine\nAlone [noise] well I Am retired Fifteen Years ago he Seventy nine years old what does he care yeah matter of fact ah he said that he did this about fifty times\nIn the Nineteen seventies Nineteen eighties and during his sentencing or in twenty Seventeen he said he was sorry I'm Sorry for the pain I have caused by his conviction and he was convicted of the crime but of course when I got thrown in jail\nHis conviction and lack of medical license will not change his professional status because he retired ten years ago and here's the good one ah he wasn't convicted of betraying his patients\nBecause the laws not specific enough he was\nA convicted of lying to investigators who are investigating it and he pled guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice and received a suspended sentence one year\nYeah pretty amazing story and incidentally as crazy as it sounds I Know about half a dozen cases throughout the years of doctors doing this\nAll right oh let's say go ahead and take a some a phone calls a Ronald we'll start with you I Ronald welcome Dan on law\nMaurice er and April I was at work and I felt when this on my right side\nThe next day I went to my doctor who immediately sent me to the hospital or on the hot water table walking Sarnoff ... I was made it into the hospital over the course for the next six days I had a CAT scan rearm our our MRIs and a spinal tap\nAt the six day those doctors cannot determine what what's wrong with me throughout those six days or can can your worst are basically paralyzed on the right side of my body after six days they just charged me not knowing what was going literary saying\nTake two Advil calm airport is so we went to get a second opinion the second doctor said he needed to see the ... from the first doctor was also a nurse narrow surgeon by the way so we went to go get those are more hours but I I felt like I was having a stroke my right side\nMore touring er my voice was armed my right side of a base or ... I went to a different hospital [noise]\nWithin two hours they were able to tell me that did not have a stroke that I had to bring a cancerous brain tumor\nThey immediately started during work I had a biopsy they told me was diagnosed with the question is if I could have gotten earlier that tumor what not to put pressure on my brain I Would not have been a Sable\nI'm OK okay I got it uh so let me throw some questions that you uh during the course of those six days had the doctors a discovery or that you had this brain tumor\nOh I'm Sorry\nI yeah I Know the doctors not discover it but that was so over six days to the brain tumor grow and\nCause pressure over six days the tumor grew Yes sir and how do you know\nThat ... I was able to walk into the hospital ... normally ... six days later that was put in such pressure on my brain dark and there was on my brain down mhm I could not walk I\nCould not pay and I was moving I'm assuming well my guess is a you left your ah neurosurgery ... surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't you didn't get board\nCertified um do you have a doctor that will say two things number one I had they taken out to the tumor six days before I you would never have had these problems and you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I'm calling you may not talk to my\n... won't be in in colleges it'll be a it'll be a general surgeon who's ... going to make that call and you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how about let's start with the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\nNot that I Know it's\nOkay so what you have is you hear your damages six days of soaring and six days of ... walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that work six days of that what do you say\nI was not able to work\nI mean you must do you miss six days at work I understand there's some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\nI honestly I'm no\nI yeah I don't either so I I think even though there could very well have been malpractice I eat then there may be an argument that there wasn't we looked and or a doctor could have easily miss that I that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said but you're making a lot of medical assumptions here\nThat ah you I don't have the legal right to make that you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions\nAnd it's going to get very wonky and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy and you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon\nWho's payoff will be six days\nOf you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work you see the problem\nRight but that's continued to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problems as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that what's cause the long term problems\nYeah okay and you know that for a fact his doctors have told you that\nYes I mean I'm Still going through chemotherapy\nI'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct All right so\nSix days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a judge jumping jacks she'd be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the tumor six days before\nOkay I Believe I well doctor\nAnd a ... where where was your residency in neurosurgery let's go through at because we have to put you on the stand and uh we have to uh absolutely a approved to the court that you have the certifications that you have the credentials as an expert so let's start with ... uh where did you go medical school\nOh Iowa okay how about
