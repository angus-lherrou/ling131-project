couponing Yes sir\nI'm trying to figure out how to get someone to live up to their their false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck All right I Would tell me what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that uh I bought from a dealership in two years in Italy they sent me a a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought their car or not\nAnd then when I went and good program on it and they appraise the car and we had about a hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition\nOr they will give you the deal and will give you a hundred percent but you got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my email specially especially that belief that this away rates as prepared Arbor you up to a hundred and ... percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this was what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original company deals to show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the ... the appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nFor their race or came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so they put they print it out to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said\nWell what about the hundred ten percent and like I I don't know nothing about that she brought the manager out I gave him the document and email and he goes OK well we'll give you a hundred percent because your card I mean you're a carpet show were initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time\nAnd he goes it will give you the deal that you need to buy one our cars and I and I go out to highlight it and I think I'd go but it says you'll buy my car in a matter of about yours or not and he says well and they they just stumbled on themselves\nWell I didn't get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask this\nUh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal and one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're much lying scum\nI bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a to a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand miles a year in my car sits on the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I Would just trying to get out of the week\nHuh okay uh and they offered a they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they're listening to you yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and here's here's\nWhere I figured out the debt because it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right no I got it okay all I have a a you can sell the car or to anybody else at or whatever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent okay\nWell the problem was with a hundred and ten percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the least at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know taking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so uh what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which is comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right\nOh okay ah but you [noise] wow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer that's the problem with the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... or the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it just small claims court\nI but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand a word of it so ah that works out doesn't\nHe ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty or a hundred and why to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy Hi\nTammy yes good morning do yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of four owners or on a property and I had them paying the property taxes for several years I have a recourse can I put a link\nThat property you already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you when you can do is sue the other ones for their pro radish share\nOkay\nThat's it how much and so in terms of taxes when you say several years all over the course of those years ah how much if you pay in taxes", "show_name": "The Financial Safari", "year":
