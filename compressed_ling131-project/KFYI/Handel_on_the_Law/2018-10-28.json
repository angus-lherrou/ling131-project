{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "And was anybody at a versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... yeah I don't think so\nHighmark\nYes I entered into a a showman contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars in payments for the next seven years I took the checks down to the bank and a crater new account\nSpecifically for those are the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through and then it was notified by the bank and set in the mail a return on a stock payment on the second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody is walking around with their head gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send them a letter out senator and breach of a\n... new\n... center to all the different\n... and ... how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or\nDays or weeks ago All right well ... couple of weeks ago is not enough time for all that they've had sixty days to respond I Know but they do and I just have a\nMore I just had one of those where it was a settlement that no we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance\nSo we settled at and they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company ... they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nOkay and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks marking ah if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's a question and then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost\nThrough OK but you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's world of insurance they're they grab you you're you're a second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment to the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh oh hey Gary welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot thirty nine home uh we when we bought a house um where was given a or excuse me a fancy and are that are\nLimited what we could do a lot of what we can do with our own\nAnd one of the stipulations of the CDC and are fed that\nEach of the homes have do we build on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer got to the city of Ventura uh the city approved the flooding of the law and now the developer is building to homes that are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what are recording\nThe record on now you are you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against them just because of the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the H away also can control\nAnd they can say no one more than one lied or one home per ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there and then in fact represent nothing but H always\n[noise] okay so you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's\nNo way in hell was especially if you're building additional home such big money for them All right max\nHi good morning for yes or buy insurance quite ... okay yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah sure never heard that one before ever max and much of that that's what\nWe want to ask me anyway anyway they shorted me based on the estimate based committed they shorted me eight or seven dollars yeah I called him a couple of times especially they told me to go around\nSaying that is anyway um anyway what I did I filed in small claims court treat other than maybe seven dollars and admittedly came with a check for five hundred\nThe verbiage on the check to check that negates voted for clay\nWondering if I could check because I Know in ... in court if I take that check yeah\nYeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would say is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely so the only way you can go and kick their bodies to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and file and small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's that's where I'm going to\nGo and good luck and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would kick it right up to superior court and so you're really not going to be in front of a a a judge a small claims judge which are usually not judge was\nOdd and daddy is and this happens all the time would be companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly however there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nAnd the plants here and not harm or if there was a technical why that prevented it from going up\nAnd because of the similarities all this with a packaging and the actual devices themselves they do believe they're all connected\nOr we don't know if it's a single person or group of people but they're all connected that way I Know experts have said that because the device has been knocked off there is a treasure trove of forensic clues that they can look at anything from DNA their fingerprints and that's obviously where the investigation is starting I\nMean they're even looking at video when the packages first made it into the postal system you know everything is tracked by video when it starts in the postal system so they're trying to like retroactively go back to see where it started and if there's any video of a person maybe dropping off or something\nIt's almost like they're trying to start from the end of the construction at the device then work their way back\nSo for now the package as either a rise are still being sent to Quantico the lab and Virginia and what they're going to try to do is traced this as it as that could include DNA or fibers found on the package as they are playing on the back of the\nDance or on the pay they'll begin this assembling these packages that tend to trace them back to their fender and so now they're going to train the whether it'd be kind of structure of the single pipe bomb whether they left them sort of\nThing that chart whether they let them sort of air any wiring and maybe that was sort of their traits that there are a lot of it that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle I had at that\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape beach I like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very new details about the ... the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of being lied explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays at the at the\nWas it an are examining nez and are going through the ants wiring and the battery aunts and overall material that age are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz as you've said is the return address for all of the ten devices\nRepresentative Maxine Waters Joe Biden Robert Deniro these are all high profile Democrats and critics of the president the administration how was the president been responding\nThat President has largely been hunting blame offices and self in his rhetoric and back onto the media so although at least I get rain Trump rally from his normal show on Wednesday night\nIt was absent from the lock her up chants while he was speaking or ... points back at the end of the ... and criticizing the media and the crowd the wild he did however at that rally\nCall for the needy at night the country he also tweeted on a Thursday again blaming the media for that he said that have very big part of the angered at least in our society it caused by basically\nFake news and that it's gotten so bad that it beyond description of what we see here is something very standard of the president a dance day it said that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be\nPretty careful that played impact and in the mid term that works you will embrace that the blame for that and putting it back to when it hits the at targets which is the media yeah\nIt's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes out the investigation is ongoing I Know details are going to be coming in and changing every day and the man hunt is on to see who or what group might have sent these out thank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter for access thanks for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[laughter] it's election\nSeason and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this here for political campaigns to reach voters\nIs not through these ads on social media it's not TV it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both taxing it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McKay but he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so use these robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial ... more people because it's a machine during that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls ... these are actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and they're becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people convince thousands of them and our\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left in the right proper like open sesame or hustled you know because that's me on the right hospital or to on the on the left to send these tax than it's essentially building a a platform to do that at scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we\nAll know that people can go and they can call and they have political candidates often a common space with other people of his supporters so it's not entirely on like that in terms of\nBeing another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rate of about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which is one of these providers to Ninety percent of tech method is I read within five minutes and I mean I think that is increasingly we know how impactful that could be given that we get\nSo much political email so much political mail in this election in every election now and there's so much messaging that any way to break through the voters is a big deal for him and\nThis is the daily died weekend edition we'll be right back with more about personalized political text messages and how to get them to stop it\nTime for broadcasters to get the recognition they deserve their role influencing pop culture and public opinion and you decide which broadcasts or the\n... year old enough that they don't weigh register online and only\nWrinkle text messages [laughter]\nRight I mean we're glued to our phones and you tend to open a text message you hear that little paying you tend to open it right away almost as you said within five minutes a lot of times we're kind of conditioned all ready to\nIgnore a robocall ignore a call that comes in from a suspicious number or an email you kind of already can see by the headline or something that it's spam or something like that but with these text messages you're really unclear about what it is so you have to open it\nBroadly speaking the tax message inbox is a lesson ad heavy spot for many\nPeople not everybody but I think generally speaking we see that the messaging after made really popular with people and and they have not been monetize in the same way as opposed to Facebook or Twitter where people are now more used to ads in the feed and messaging will probably be in the\nYeah and since it's a a person to person saying I mean obviously they're kind of sending them and massing all but campaigns are hoping for that interaction maybe it is something you're interested in you text back and you say hey where is that rally going to be or what's going on then it opens that line of communication and the campaign can interact directly with those voters\nAnd now obviously the huge benefit for voter contact another isn't as he said that they like this technology\nObviously a lot of people are angry though for myself I feel like I Can't trust my phone anymore you know if a suspicious phone calls coming in I don't know if I should answer it or not now with the ... ... email the same way now it's text messages us a lot of voters are angry about this because they feel like they\nDidn't sign up for these things how are these campaigns getting your phone numbers and then you know I I Know that there's been a few complaints and lawsuits filed already of\nCampaigns are are getting this from voter record for from the firms that binds motorcade I mean there's a long standing pretty significant market for a voter data that feeds into all of that the digital advertising that we see and\nAnd so a lot of records are there and there's always a lot of public information you're right that some consumers have not been super happy with this they filed a complaint with the Federal Communications commission said I Know there's some effort to get some clarity about what these messages are subject to restrict from either one of the FCC they haven't ruled on that yet\nOne of the ways they get your phone numbers and this was I mean how to be one of the most creative ways I guess there was a liberal billionaires name was Tom Steyer and he had a political\nActually grew they submitted a freedom of Information Act request to public colleges asking for their student directory and\nI think Eighteen schools complied with it then they went through all those directory as they got all the phone numbers that they could and then that's how they built out their own list and then they sent text messages to all those people so they're finding your numbers any way they can I think there were reports that the Trump Administration\nWas renting out numbers that they have to political campaigns though like thirty five dollars per one thousand address as things like that the big question how do we get these things to stop\nYou Ken ... should be able to tell that they're coming from an individual this up as a attended number and you should be able to text that stopped but it is that these be political parties and candidates are exempt from the do not call list which has also been large ineffectual anyway and a lot of ways and so that is not enough to get them to not exit\nRight I mean that's the problem that we have with robo calls and I get it the way they implement these things are different but we've all been in those situations where we say stop calling me put me on your do not call us and we still get those calls and this peer to peer taxing is largely unregulated right now the FCC isn't really doing much they're maybe they're trying to catch up\nBye bye from where my cap to balance the role of the\nI'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week I don't have to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise\n[laughter]\nFor the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the Central American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border to\nHelp stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant carbon we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked up on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think\nThe one difference we have here is we're now at the doorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats stand for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe seemed to these countries you know Honduras El Salvador Guatemala they're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there so you know some military guys they put up a roadblock ate at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they weren't going to be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting aid I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then into an Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and and and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere in four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't\nWant to do that on his own and these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give in Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the mid term do you know he's saying whenever you see these people come across in these criminals and unknown middle Easterners and everything to keep the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws\nSo he makes it about the midterms and everything and he provides a little covered by being forceful but\nIs there not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now and only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think it is an issue that is really important to Republican voters and it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks and less so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now whether\nAny of these proposals you know border wall slashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when Congress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them\nThey really struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation and the White House suppose the bills that had the most support so it's hard to imagine that after the midterms with Democrats likely to take back some ground in the house is not when it entirely that they'd come back to the table and work out a better deal\nWhat has been the reaction from the leaders of these countries Honduras Guatemala El Salvador I Know the Mexican the incoming Mexican president has suggested that the U.S Canada and Mexico work out some\nFunding development for poor areas of Central America in southern Mexico where are these companies trying to do to reduce this type of migration\nThe presidents of the the northern triangle countries were up in Washington DC not too long ago for a summit convened by the U.S and Mexico jointly\nTo talk about these very issues\nAnd you know for the most part they're open to cooperating on security issues but there are clearly limitations in some cases those are economic limitations of not having the funding to do it and that's I mentioned before with us funding is being cut towards these kind of projects and Central America right now and then in other cases it's political and it's because of\nPolitical instability in their home country I mean I'm Doris in particular is an example where I'm the president there Juan Orlando Hernandez is a strong us ally but one\nNarrow reelection and it doesn't really have much of a mandate to govern you definitely have different\nSituations in each country in different capacities as to how they're able to address this\nTen has an immigration reporter for Politico thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having a\n[laughter]\nAn interesting story that came across our radar this week was about youth hostels expanding in the United states\nBut they're shutting their old identities they don't want to be called hospitals anymore it's a shift in the fast growing hotel industry that's making its way away from its barebones past of traditional hospitals are adding more private rooms some with establish hotel brands are shrinking room sizes\nBut putting more focused on bars and food to target millennials and betting that young travelers are going to pay a higher price for the bar and food offerings well paying lower prices for the bad so I brought in my producer Miranda to talk about the one of the leaders in these hotel hostile hybrids\nThere's this Lyndon based hospitality group called generator and they just opened their first us property in Miami Beach last month this is the first time that this company has made their dorm room like accommodation outside Europe for the first time ever and they kinda get irritated if you'd call them yeah\nHostels 'cause they said that the hostile thing doesn't describe them that way\nThat they're Miami property has more private rooms than the dorm room setting like bunk beds that you were describing\nYeah they want to be placed in this space between a hostile and a cool boutique hotel\nYeah and they do look like a call ... help you go on their website they've really look beautiful and I was looking at some of the options because I was like OK let's pretend we're going to go to Miami I Want the premium room it's a little bit bigger it's got a giant king sized bed at least one to two people\nAnd it's only a hundred and twenty five dollars a night to state two minute walk on red each in Miami or are you kidding\nThis all geared towards younger travelers and it's big business the world tourism organization said that travelers age Fifteen to twenty nine accounted for an estimated twenty three percent of all international travellers and twenty Fifteen so nearly a quarter of travelers\nOur youth travelers and they spent over two hundred and eighty billion dollars\nTraveling and staying and all these accommodations so a lot of these brands are making an effort to offer these low cost rooms and even these dorm style rooms where you have a few bunk beds and people can kind of just staying there\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading these ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's or in in the hotel bathroom\nInto a pill bottle that she could then smuggle path park security while others will simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a ... that that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the rights particularly dark so no one sees\nThem other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who in two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle\nAnd ran across the grass flinging them she ran\nWild and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of the sit there and I just saw the you know so [laughter] so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn for a ashes doesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine\nHow many people do this and never get caught but you're right that in talking to ... thirty in the consensus that I arrived that would that have\nHappened about once a month but I've heard stories of it happening more frequently heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the park has says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public\nAbout the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so probably we point of\nPride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and something that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes\nSo it was something that they were really touched by and and actually quite eager to share with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nI Love the quote someone said that the hunter mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know the haunted mentioned right is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning in the next time I'm going to be they're going to be like trying to look for human ashes\nAnd of course number eight is very timely since it's called market risk [laughter] I didn't plan that ahead but boy is it tightly right I'm I'm kind of going in order and a number eight is market ... so what that means is that when you are a retired person or you are about to retire um that is\nOne of the biggest risks that you face in terms of your investments is that you get hit by a big downdraft in your investments and now you don't have as much as you at once had so are we going to talk about number eight market risk now also\nSince we are a a firm that specializes in retirement planning a one of the big topics that we talk about with clients are pretty much I Would say every time we visited seems like\nUm is Social Security so we're going to have some ... we had to have some questions or that or I Want to share with you and of course the answers to those questions about Social Security that I think might be on your mind so we're going to have the so skewed the security ...\nNow also in\nView of our philosophy so because we work with people who are mostly retired are retiring soon our philosophy of how to manage your money is preservation of principle comes first okay we want to grow your money certainly we want to give you the income all those things are important but first and foremost we want to make sure that we protect your principal\nBecause for you to be able to go out and enjoy the all the things that you want in your retirement if you get hit by a big bad bear and it takes down twenty thirty or fifty percent of your money you know that's going to change a lot for you\nSo I'm going to ask you the question the average bear market and this is according to Ned Davis research going back to the great depression the average bear market\nIs the loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent and Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you ... if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nAt age sixty or at age Seventy five which one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so\nSo we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great in though right\nAnd that's how most cells would just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally a that's you know that's the part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to\nPay a gift tax okay because the IRS\n[laughter] [noise] yeah those guys they want the tax gift\nAnd college in most cases is more is is is expensive and you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a a we think the boys\nAnd girls clubs as one as a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a\nSponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we want to raise money for that and last\nWeekend we had the gala at uh in in Plano in North Dallas and uh we raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven\nUm you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells a philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet\nUh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven and what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens\nIs that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may those two\nWhich we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out and uh those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't\nAnd the market to rebound quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we

now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that

the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that\nSo here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security uh journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase\nSo the question is it by enroll in Medicare at sixty five but I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits\nThe answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months at age eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply as can a person born\nIn Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed\nYou can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file essay form five Twenty one so so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed\nYou can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later All right\nSo that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nHas this
