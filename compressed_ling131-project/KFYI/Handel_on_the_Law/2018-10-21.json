{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Yeah I mean how much is a ticket I don't like older couple of dollars\nAre going to be a lot more and I you know what here you go to court I Would just pay it but ...\nYou may have an argument and you go in front of a judge Ito your honor here's what happened a B C and D and uh they said we should have filed the police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker on a license plate because once I put the sticker on the license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nThat microsecond every day\nYeah exactly I think it's I think paying it's a different these in defense a sure tell it to a judge 'cause the words that happens you have to pay for the ticket anyway or or\nI mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane defenses you've ever seen\nAnd and the fun one where ah the people come up and they say guilty with an explanation\nAs if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or not so whenever you see someone guilty with an explanation are pending on the judge or if the judge allows a person to explain just to get it off his or her chest the ... the judges eyes roll which is always kind of fun or the judge will say\nWho cares\nYou know explain it to your pet rock while or because I don't want to hear it so I Would go try it why not I think if you look at it I mean it's it's certainly as why don't you go what you're saying\nHi Stephen you're up welcome\nGood morning Yes sir bill I've got a question about employment ah I signed on with the company or back on the two thousand and part of my original chop off or was that I Would\nBe entitled to a bar of a minimum of ten thousand dollars per year ah they pay that bonus for both the first six or seven years and then not when the economy hit the skin and they're like in two thousand they ah they\nContinued not to pay me that bonus for a total of nine years I left the company last year and I'm Wondering if I have a case to go back and and take a little fun\nRight so here's the question right they breached the contract or by not\nPaying you a bonus of a minimum of ten thousand years or ten thousand dollars a year which incidentally uh there was nothing in the contract that said no matter whether they made money or not or the ... the economy\nI it's now you'll get your ten thousand right that's right\nAll right so they haven't paid you for nine years in particular reason you waited nine years to not get paid\nOh I spoke to him about it and they basically said well you know our economy here\n[laughter] ... no I understand that and that's and so that's the reason now I can understand that for four years when the economy tanked right I get that right but after four\nYears or you're still looking at five years of the economy doing much better\nAnd to the point where the economy has become a has gotten on fire I mean it has exploded for the last couple of three years and why have you didn't you go in there say hey guys I didn't because the economy was really crap during the recession but now that it's doing great and that everybody's making money\nHow about a check you didn't do that\nI did that bill and then but my ... was he bought my salary a little bit but he didn't pay any bonuses\nOkay so you accepted uh the salary bump and then go after the bonus\nAll right so now a let me give you a fun a a fun legal aspect and it's called a stop all\nWaiver and stop all that's yes T. O. P. P. E. L. stop all which is a fun way of I guess the Italians say stop to stop all it is a legal doctrine that says even if you do have a case\nIf you will ... not to go forward and argue your breach you accepted that\nAnd that's the argument they're going to make you have accepted the fact that they're not going to\nPay you a bonus now uh can you go back you're not gonna go back nine years I guarantee you that uh can you go back uh maybe but they're going to keep on arguing I Would saying hey you know what yeah we had a deal but we weren't dealing with it and he's obviously he's OK with it so um\nYou can talk to a lawyer how many the bonus side ten thousand dollars by the way you at least ten thousand dollars is very interesting uh but let's say the only be liable if there's liability for ten grand and that's over Ninety Ninety thousand dollars you know we're talking to a lawyer\nYeah yeah so I talked to a lawyer and we'll see how far how far it goes in hello and welcome\n[noise] yes ma'am\nPatty away and he was twelve years older than my belt and when we got married\nHad gone through a divorce and whatever whatever that most of the ... it was fine but truly here I put everything in her name and long story short we went to an attorney and the and the attorney thing they can area\nDid he tell you why\nMy husband know from an organization and it was the good old boy\nI don't know knowing that does make any sense of ...\nThat I think he was going to take my ... for everything and not leave your children and what he is\nDead [noise]\nOkay well that a long story short I have to wait no problem that we don't do what you wind up with it and I knew what I Want what their\nOkay that's after he died you said that any more he died you said that I'm a little confused here okay alright college I don't want to write so he took twenty five percent of the state and did what we want\nIn my family so I don't\nKnow how I killed or how did he leave it to your side of the family that I found out what instrument did he used to leave it\nI don't trust\nSo you do it and so there isn't irrevocably trust right in\nOkay All right okay All right\nSo uh what's your question about uh the irrevocably part of the trust\nThe loud family my family has nothing to do with me and what not to do with me and I wouldn't like twenty five and leaving\nBut the other theory on that is that tricky one that story out there because they don't want to admit that they have this study on what wired\n... foreign affairs correspondent for Politico thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me\nThere has been a ton of developments since that interview that we did with in the hall that kind of sets up with the whole story is about after that Turkish officials were leaking all sorts of stories to the media part of it was they said they had audio recordings of what happened inside the Saudi conflict\nThey said that Mr ... was dead within minutes and within two hours\nAll of the killers are gone there said there was a Fifteen person hit team that went in there Miranda tell us what some of these gruesome details or because\nIt plays like a spy movie all this secret shady stuff happening in these political constantly it's you know it it's crazy the secrecy that happens in there that they think that they can get away with this kind of stuff what are some of these details of how they say he died\nYeah and like you said there were Fifteen people waiting for him for hours to show up and they knew what they were going to do they have this all planned out from the beginning and like you said he was dead within minutes they separate his fingers and cut his head off\nAnd as they cut off his head and dismembered his body there was a doctor a forensic who had been brought along so that he could assist with the defection and the disposal of some of the body parts and he had some advice for them\nIncluding one was to listen to music as he put his own headphones on because that's what he like to do to try to ease the tension when quote doing such work\nThey said that he was dead within minutes but how quick and fast the torture was you know I'm assuming well and what were those minutes ... right exactly I'm assuming some of those minutes where it's been cutting fingers off or wants to cut off your head that's kind of messy and the end of it but yeah for the doctor\nTo want to be wearing these headphones and listening to music just so drawn up the craziness of what's going on in front of you is just ridiculous\nReports that the one of the members of the Fifteen person assassin team world in there with the bones are right that's going to make some a gross noises exactly don't want to hear\nThis is turning to just a mess on the diplomatic side\nThe United states is struggling with how to respond to this the world is crying out that Saudi Arabia and the crown princes directly involved in this new Trump Administration wants to tread very lightly they are an ally we do a lot of business with them they buy a lot of weapons from us in the billions of dollars\nAnd the president doesn't want to endanger that President Trump spoke to reporters and acknowledge that it certainly looks as though he's dead now what else did the president saying how what else is going on in the administration\nIn addition to his comments that quote certainly looks as though\nHer show jail is dead he threatened very severe consequences if the Saudis are found to have murdered him and before he spoke\nTreasury secretary Steve Mnuchin pulled out of a major upcoming Saturday investment conference Mike Pompeo has been over there interviewing people trying to figure out what's gone on and he even advised that the Saudis should be given a few more days to finish and make public they're credible investigation before\nThe U.S decides how or if they want to respond\nTo give them a few more days to think about how they want to cover this I'm ... I mean they're so a lot of evidence now they're releasing video surveillance of these fifteenth person hitting walking in to the constantly and walking out you know with a huge briefcase will get into some of those details in just a minute\nWe never saw ... walk you know and\nHe never walked out himself this investment conference that's happening there and a Steven Mnuchin pulling out there's all sorts of companies that have pulled out just saying we can't do business with you until we know what's happening nobody wants to do business with killers\nAnd this is a major blow to them because at this point with the crown prince coming into power very soon they're portraying him as a reformer he's very good friends with Jared Kushner he's trying to open up the country to a lot of new investment and this was just totally uh throwing a wrench into it my palm pales telling him\nYou need to have a credible investigation and a credible answer to all this or you're not going to be a credible king when your time comes\nAnd it's important that you bring up that Jared Kushner connection because he is one of those people who the top aide to President Trump he's been in President Trump's ear and we can kind of hear that conversation that they've had when President Trump spoke to the media on Thursday about what's going on with the investigation because\nTrump emphasized the billions of dollars and weapons to Saudi purchases from the U.S and all of the money that exchanges hands between countries\nYou're listening to the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar mirrors and when we come back we'll finish explaining the story of ... and we'll explain how Saudi Arabia plans on blaming an intelligence official for the killing\n[noise] much as ... way too early to\nHave you ever heard of a bank was water heater is exactly what it sounds like it's a water continue\nOur conversation about how Saudi Arabia plans to blame and intelligence official for the killing of Jamal ... [laughter]\nSo what are the rulers of Saudi Arabia considering where are they trying to place the blame on this\nThey want to blame one of the crown prince Mohammed top intelligence officers and the plan is to assign blame to major general Amman our theory he's a high ranking advisor to the crown prince and blaming this general would provide\nA reasonable explanation for the killing and try to deflect the blame from the prince because American intelligence agencies are very convinced\nTheir\nArms to team way but it's no game based on how you vote on your front throws the mores of the week\nAnd don't forget to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nI think one of the stories that's captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nAnd I think I called my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been insanely mouthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out and yeah and she would know that people to call the ... generation\nThat's funny I bet you're going to say something like hey now I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter]\nI I mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you shouldn't be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there's only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know good luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million a breeze for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and then I ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so and I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo Duterte ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer for us and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning big I spoke to a uh Jason curling he's an attorney based in union New York he's actually a self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners ... eleven\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protected them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money as such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars still a ton of money\nOne of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it was like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also pretty large so people to the question that I get most frequently is can I claimed my jackpot anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to end encouraged to file what's called the public records requests and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game\nSo we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on the statewide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the or an entity to claim the ... James carry his his name director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could delay your name coming out because the the trustworthy L. L. C. might get first building and there there is only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota\nOhio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere you're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately\nBefore you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skip town if you can write a letter announcing that turned out there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news the media started hunting down any pictures that they can of you or you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts have said close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple experts is yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but people that might want to start contacting you for money for charity and that's another issue is that you know a lot of charities that\nWill tend to reach out to jackpot winners they all digital meant but then there are a lot they're bogus that's what they think Carlin the lottery lawyer was telling me is you know you kind of have to keep it to yourself and more weight and more ways than just one not just a matter of not talking to people and telling them about it but\nYes scrub your social media if you can if you have your phone number out there to try to get it down just so that\nAgain like you said kind of to lay people doing that 'cause especially in New Jersey inevitably it it's probably going to happen and your name will be out there but at least maybe stave it off for a little bit\nRight and you know as far as like skipping town and all these all these steps the initial interest is there as soon as the name comes out so hopefully after the news cycle switches a little bit\nMaybe you can kind of get away with being so popular ... if if you take the proper steps what about the office pool because we do that here at work and thankfully the\nPerson who kind of runs the office pool for us is very transparent with everything she always takes pictures of all the tickets very clear with everyone we split everything no matter what the prizes but I Know that people run into that problem a lot trying to claim while I got this ticket or that was my money and different things like that\nThere's a few issues with that and that's actually one of the biggest pitfalls that the lottery lawyer mentioned to me is first of all a lottery tickets what's called the ...\nWhich is basically just a fancy term to say that the whole there is presumed to be the owner\nSo if you have a ticket that's the ... you know the winning lottery tickets and let's say you drop it in the street someone picks it up and science the back of it it's now their ticket whoever picks it up and signed that is their tickets so the issue that comes into play with office pools is that you know people chip in cash to buy these lottery tickets and then when one of the ticket holders ends up winning\nIt kind of ended up being a messy brawl figure out who's actually entitled to the prize money so the best way to prevent any kind of litigation or issue to begin with is to make copies of each of the ticket that were purchased and then send a specific ticket numbers to people in the office pool in an email thread\nThat way you have at least some kind of a paper trail right\nSo if we're there to be an luckily some kind of litigation\nA judge could look at that email and say well if it's right here in writing that this was your ticket and this was your ticket and so on and so forth so\nYeah it's so important to contact the right people when you come into large sums of money we've all heard about the lottery curse people getting tons of money flowing at all and you know in their life is worse off than before I'm In California I see people lining up all the time\nHitting the previous winner locations in trying to buy those tickets how's it going there in New Jersey\nIs definitely a little bit of a buzz if not to say a lot of buzz I Believe there was a winning lottery ticket I sold was in a specific convenience store and because of that a bunch of people were running back\nLike beer and the industry is pretty innovative won in some way so you know maybe if they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that too but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're missing when my beer and you know everybody's like interest in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories in the pod cast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween\nThat I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week was that a child vampire burial that was found in Italy ab cemetery there was this eerie discovery ... they found it was a skeleton of a ten year old that had\nA rock lodged in his mouth they buried this child is way because they were afraid it was going to come back to life and contain the spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university that Stanford\nWent on this gig in\nItaly and they found this\nChild cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic\nRoman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall like you can think about it like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside a limestone rocks\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said\nThey believed that child died\nAs malaria sixty miles north of round\nAnd they said that the way that they buried this catalyst they ... they ... already dead they opened an ounce for ... to the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the rock wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impressions right locally or they're calling it the vampire of little nano it's in this like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called the London properly they bend beanie\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in his burial site you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of or in\nThese trenches they're dirt coverage trenches there was a remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents toad bones bronze called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that thing where people and I I don't know how this would apply to children but it had violated society's rules and the name vampire ...\nAnd a lot of these archeology\nThis one researcher saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why it was popping up and things that they feared they thought might come back from the day that thought they were vampires that's why they\n[noise] I've come to the point where I realized that we have a responsibility to all these families that we work with\nAnd so one of the things that I thought about was you know you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do [laughter] that would be a bad thing right so one of the things that we decided to do was that we would have what we call vision one hundred\nAnd vision one hundred is that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong if not stronger as it is today\nSo how do you do that how do you build a company that's going to be here a hundred years from now serving our current clients their families down the line and all of those kinds of things and so to do that\nI studied a variety of companies that have been in business for a hundred years\nTo see how they did it because if you think about it the last hundred years have been you know fraught with all kinds of things you had world wars we've had a you know bad economic times we've had boom times technology's changed I mean everything it's like all kinds of stuff that happened but yet these companies endured and so what was it\nThat enabled them to endure\nAnd so I Want to take you this or this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and then you're investing life because we're a financial advisory firm so it'll\nIt sounds kind of a you know philosophical this week but I think we're going to bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as as uh from\nWhat we've decided is that we have to go so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy\nThat helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to accomplish so in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are that we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want them to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that and philosophically how that would apply to you is that\nWhen you retire we specialized work with people who are retired or retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just lost your money you're you're you're done financially or they have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life okay\nSo in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six of core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing\nAlways do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrifice honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nObfuscating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that what will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is\nIt will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if it's for example if you lied on your resume to get a job and you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on their resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't\nAnd it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty to to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever\nWe disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision\nAnd we never have to apologize for anything [noise]\nNow one of the things that uh\nI Am not going to apologize for is that we would like to have you if you are\nThe person that we specialize in working with as a client\nSon to do some selling here or if you are over

for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last\nNineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at every single one of them has had a character of its own and they've all been different and they've all been that and this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over a thousand families\nSo [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently uh barons named why you're faithful host one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row and uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of a of a business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business\nIs the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life and so I think that uh this week that this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with eight thousand families and if you think about how many people that is you know when you think of a family of grandparents do you have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren\nI mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that I Am just then grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now and if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taken care of and so well they're down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have\nTo build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last\nOver a hundred years and I think families so to apply this to you personally families that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients are obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble\nIf we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in the broader context and how you would apply to in your life you know I I my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song or you know ... I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay so now you got to keep keep doing that\nMaking a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters we want anybody that comes to ah talk to us that does not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have\nThat person understand that every single time don't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way\nYou take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so you don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe it is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not\nAnd what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net is our website money matters dot net\nAnd do you have three things that you can do their alright what one is you can get my market alert email\nAnd it's free goes out at least weekly and or you can subscribe to that also you can click on meat with an advisor and you can sit down with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be professional friendly knowledgeable and they will help you to build your financial plan and I will do all that at no charge or obligation and if it helps you fantastic\nAnd if it doesn't you know what that's fine too we will part French\nAnd then finally you if you don't want to do any of those things that you can also do a third thing which is you can go to one of our seminars and over the years we've had thousands of people attend our seminars\nAnd uh I think they've enjoyed them and you can learn about your retirement planning your a diversification Social Security all those kinds of things and uh and and and lots of information at our center some money matters dot net is our website for all of the above money matters\nDot net All right we're going to take a break and we're gonna come back we're going to talk about how to grow your money with confidence and not worry so much", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Handel on the Law", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "21"}
