{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "I Would have a good outcome\nOn this is going on yeah on this point you want to refute it start with that uh start with a send me the forms to refuted I Want a reconsideration does is Fifteen Years ago and they do have the process you have to go through all of that first okay because something somebody is making a mistake that doesn't work for\nThe new the new and said what we bought that so it just starts all over again\nIt's not true well that's what they called me I don't\nKnow if I knew collection agency or the credit reporting agency ... collection is\nOkay have you checked have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report\nYes absolutely entitled on and it's still on the credit report correct\nOkay you can't forget about the collection agencies ah they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten them or I as I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against me and you argue consenting to\n[noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so ah the next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports vets that's an issue\nBecause that's a huge damages so well could actually destroys your life effectively having no credit especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork\nAnd you were a few days and you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years I've been dropping from the credit report and what are they gonna say nope that policy has gone it's crazy\nI agree it's crazy yeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients\nWho had ah the issue with these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer apply for your statue in California for example when on paper to prompt a credit card or any written a contract and a credit card agency or collection agencies in some of them are real ... agencies\nHave called and people know there is a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years ago there was a four year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they changed the law last month it's now a ten year statute and\nWhat do you do well my clients had okay just sent me this give me the code just told me don't tell me the number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh you know that sort of thing\nThat is horrible world out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole just I think it's going to be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit\nBut it's a it has to explode just has to explode All right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen year old was in a clothing store and a high on the repairs camp [noise]\nShe walked up to the girl checked the items [noise] ah she checked committed something I'm not sure what she did she handed the garment factor\nShe went and tried in on the parents want him how to accept device without the cover and its last scratch your leg\nYeah Eighteen Inches ooh or anything there\nI mean is there anything there are I mean he told me about the scratch or was the was the family Ari a artery cutting did she bleed out there is a\nNo no I wasn't I was thinking more of a the stress and we went through\nWe all know no ... no one cares about your stress that\nFor an aids test we had to have her tips\nFor aids wait a second an aids test because one of those security devices scratched her and you did an aids test\nWell how many people many others cups crashed but how do we\nRight okay so you do the AIDS test and of course came up negative\nYes okay now what that's why I'm asking you know no\nMatter of fact there is nothing but good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or in the AIDS or that yeah yeah no there's nothing there\nThere's there I mean theoretically now did you go to the doctor did she get stitches uh yeah the emotional ... there's not an ... an emotional issue when you get scratched\n[laughter] so no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is their right mind means or anything they're in you know everybody default this is America where you'd default to how do I get money\nThat's it how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what what happened in oh okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught ah I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because it might anticipation of getting money\nOh sure that's a great case oh why not\nAdding is high Agnes welcome to handle on law and get my hair and I\nOh I got a path problem I have a like a fake test for that guy can what less than half an hour and they kept me seven hundred and I didn't I doubt it I Won that that I have to and then ride the family and ...\nFrom what I mean how much should you pay them and how do they\nKnow how much do you think you should do they fix it or not\nI think they're hoping that half an hour\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they fixing half an hour or did they give you a bed did they give you\nAn estimated there may be All right did you pay\nDid you pay for that\nStore being fixed and when did they do they say it was\nGoing to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they handed you a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo they'll know nothing already than just don't pay I got in a\nWell then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you say I pay too much\nSo it's so they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars\nAnd so on and then there's the issue of uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's a that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so uh you wanna do it's worth something Agnes right the work they did\nNot like what do you think you should pay I mean I think you know much about it\nThe yard and release of pink balloon and that pink balloons are supposed to signify that something terrible had happened\nI mean that's a totally crazy you can't trust people to be reliable enough to do that but it was supposed to alert Ninety percent of the country within thirty seconds that something crazy was going on but there is no message attached\nTo it it's just being balloons that means mass hysteria would break out so they cancel that program 'cause it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of Nixon there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system that did device and what this was is it something that you can plug into your TV like think about a fire stick in the seventies\nBasically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody'd be watching the same program informing you of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading us what happened yesterday the public lost all trust with the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their homes\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to buzz your phone\nWhenever he wants to just to clarify if not the president's sitting in his office and saying I'm going to send out this alert no ... there's a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis is a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's gonna be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how they use it and then obviously what the emergency is hopefully aliens don't invade us\nRight in the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time so I didn't talk was half forgot about that there is among strange history of emergency alerts thanks Miranda think he wants to go you're listening to the daily diving weekend edition I'm Oscar ... and we'll be right back with more\nWho else wants to discover how to invest in cash flowing apartments without dealing with a single tenant join us for a fast start to our free training of the week\nReally I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies\nIt takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it this guy in particular has an interesting story he won the lottery hit it big one Nineteen million dollars\nAnd then blew through all of his he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nI'm a Santa Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks was is the tea crews are banned it it was completely captivating and I'm ready for like the Martin Scorsese as he good fellas style movie about this guy\nI remember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him the P. T. crews are bad at it was his getaway car use the stolen money that he got from the bags to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking who was the P. T. crews are banned it Jim have\nOh Jim have was a security guard who back in the late nineties one night the million dollar and the California state lottery and then over the course of the next decade sort of amazingly and managed to\nLose it all and then after losing it all came out\nPretty accessible bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he wouldn't then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking for ten years in prison now and writing letter so he kind of ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we had gotten her pour his lawyers and told me you know I\n... going to be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story so why don't you send him a letter in prison and a clean up for it he had already pled guilty I think it was waiting for\nSentencing carrying acquainted eye contact with him so he basically before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been sentenced in K ... thing and the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying\nHey I Am fascinated by what I've read about you know I Want to know more can we talk can we can we had to be pen pals and he wrote and that and then I send them all that stuff like five or six questions is hoping he might get back and he brought me back\nTo the plate really amazingly like up the letter with\nLike a really good sense of humor and like a lot lot of exclamation points not what I expected it all like in terms of tone\nSo I was like oh man now even more fascinated by it because you don't seem to be found out about the fact that now you're doing your whole career in federal prison it kind of had this happy go lucky even now kind of attitude which\nAfter everything you've been through ... well let's start with some of the good stuff then so he won Nineteen million dollars in lottery I was actually Thirteen point seven million wants taxes were taken out of climate in it of its own so you got\nA shortage about five million dollars out of that he was getting twenty annual payments of about six hundred eighty four thousand dollars every year what did he spend money on what was that life like after he hit it big\nAt first it was a super extravagant ... I think a total of at least that meant in anger erratic sports cars they had\nHarare landlord gloomy is that when we were like a Barry into cars and so just dumped a ton of money into that\nI think it was ... might have been his first wife who said that all that money changed him and he had this hot seat taught the attitude after he was\nAlone yeah that was his longtime rival girlfriend she saw haven't changed she met him I think when they were a teenager and Seventeen and that then together for Fifteen Years and she hadn't changed towards the end of their relationship\nHe was a partying with actors he had a personal photographer at some point which I thought it was pretty interesting\nYou said he race lamborghini's with Mario Draghi and everything whatever you're going to do to live life to the fullest speech run houses actress girlfriends that whole thing is what he was all doing so and that's what happened to it later on the articles someone was saying\nThat is what happens to these people they hit it big there is thrust into like another subset of social life now and they're not ready for it and they don't know how to really interact in that when they come up with so much money\nWas actually yeah and the way that his second wife explained it to me with\nThat look you know he's the guy from kind of a middle class upbringing working charity failed he really had no sort of concept of wealth management or like the smart thing you can do and ... and didn't really care like he was kind of high hopes the\nAdrenaline and the money that all the data and a lot of bad decisions with his money and he'll tell you that to ... ... not really kind of living in the moment and not really thinking about the future and not a bad thing and just a lot of it and the first year\nThat failed robbery and they set up\nA camera along the highway and basically we're just looking for that knowing that he was probably going to strike and knowing what his vehicle was set it up\nAnd then went inevitably he hit again and I don't think it it wasn't too much later into the timeline and it was definitely less than a month and then knowing that he hit again just think that up with Ryan line and when the bank had occurred and then went through the camera footage they got a\nA help from a tip you know the bust at his house was very dramatic he was walking out of the garage and they planted in with a are safe teams and clock pistols and got him and boom that he was arrested in or being sentenced to thirty three months in prison three years of supervised release after that we know when he would get out\nAnd he had to pay back the money in restitution his release date is February twenty third twenty twenty so he still has a little bit of time in there what does he been doing with his time there and what are his plans after he gets released\nHe's been making art in prison it's good in trying every letter that he sent me had like some sort of elaborate picture on it like one hadn't Garfield on it is a cat and\nOh you have some of those on Twitter something I've been so people can\nHe wants to publish a book at the end of this right\nHe's working on a on a book I Know that he's like playing softball Ethan exercising and that is kind of like tapped into his ... side yeah the funny like optimistic view of all that now can you satellite look I'm clean and sober now and yeah I Know like fourth day talks for\nThe better he even said himself that it helped him more so than the money ever did and that's why I I mean I Love these stories it's\nThat rise and fall it's coming into something and you know everybody internalize as like what would you do how would I react this happened to me and it's just a crazy story from\nBeing on the highest of highs to being so desperate that you have to turn to bank robbery and then obviously you know you get caught you know nobody ever gets away with anything at the end of it Natalie O'Neill contributor for the Daily Beast and freelance journalist thank you for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media at daily got caught on\nTwitter you can do we do have to talk to us on Facebook\nLeave us comments give us a rating and tell us a story that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts [noise] I'm Oscar mirrors and this is the daily died weekend edition [noise]\nFor more information on contests on five fifty\nA boy I sort of why I was\nThe last time you check your credit scores of the week and don't have to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nPrizes were also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine they went to two people Dr James Alison and ... on Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs immuno therapy quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it ... you know works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking him who were these Nobel Prize winners\nJames Allison ...\nBoth of them have specialized in immunology studying the body's\nImmune system this turned out to be a critical part of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective and are effective in certain situations but\nBut it can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells ... along with cancer cells so that kind of the causes all sorts of complications going back about Fifteen Twenty years\nThere was another ... Vance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutation in cancer cells now this immune based approaches sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time\nThese two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that have used certain kinds of drugs to target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells of T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nWhat's so interesting about what they discovered\nWas that the body's immune system has sort of its own\nNatural check points or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack that healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figured out how to exploit that and so they in some way they sort of latch on to the break of the body's immune system in a way that helps them escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off of the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he is key true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nBefore they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of that a path to being as a fungus or some other sort of disease that the thing that has evolved over many millions of years in ants which then as you mentioned the fungus hassle\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so then scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume when smell a little different than a typical and so because they have\nThis really intricate\nUnique system of missing out bad actors in the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing the ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago and this is in fact\nThat they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presumed that the fungus has\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the ... in the colony but that might get a found out in that would get dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article chew it has to drive the host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms and the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is\nLiterally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus is ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree so you know this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem possible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex\nBecause the ant colony is itself extremely complex and able to sniff out this sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball to avoid detection and really pull off this\nStunningly complex devious manipulation\nThat's how we get the zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process and infiltrating the colonies and even half the time it right the you know the fungus has a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colonies that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything it's just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in a South Carolina I think uh we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the pain of all if that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened here in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is the fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the ban of relief but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a purge it's easier to get a purchase on\nThe vein of a leap biting into it so it actually happens here in the United states is as the fungus there's ordering the aunt to bite onto the flag it's not such a good purchase\nBut then orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that\nStem and that's just all the more power to to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because\nIn the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forest where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and that will over winter just sitting there on the stem biting its time and then once the spring comes around it will then finally a rough out of the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely I've tapped to to really ruin the day of the ants in a in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the ...\nAnd so to do that we believe you need to have a a a plan in place that addresses all the things that could harm you and believe it or not when you are retired there are actually\nEighteen risks that you face they're Eighteen of him and a properly designed plan in my opinion is one that addresses all Eighteen of those so we're going to talk about risk number seven this week which is\nFinancial elder abuse okay so if you have an older family member or someone in their seventies eighties\nUh or or older I Want to talk with you about that it's a big big deal uh unfortunately now also we're going to talk about Social Security this week so ah we're going to answer the question when should you wait until you're Seventy to start collecting Social Security\nOkay so there are reasons why you may want to do that and so we want to help you understand that uh that strategy\nNow also from it from an investment standpoint you know we want as I said we want you to enjoy your second childhood so whatever that means to you if you if it means playing a lot of golf if it means traveling if it means spending time with your grandchildren whatever that means to you that's great we want to help you achieve that\nBut if you lose a large amount of your money in the next market downturn than I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nSo therefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that is called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by whole myth that is a I've heard or I've called because I've heard it and that is\nThat if you sell you know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money a while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing and that's like the silliest\nThing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go over with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nDoing today on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week\nAnd this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your\nUh not too you're very uh what's the opposite of greedy I'm\nGiving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive end up before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise]\nUm you know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy\nAnd this puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she's like a big dog and you forget that she's just a baby\nUm and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd uh so the the update because people apparently are interested in this I don't know why is that a noodle house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pay however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and ... a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she pays right on the patio and colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but\nI Hope so [laughter] anyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now there's some\nTalk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower that\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so\nThe economy is strong and so the fed most likely it's going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days would that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bond even longer than five years\nAs the Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future of the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market where it falls and crashes\nIt's like this this general decline that last for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a ... a couple of months ago we\nReduce the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence\nBecause what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of ah accounts goes up and ... because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we wanna we wanna make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd there's a link on there that says meet with an advisor and if you click on that than oh you know we'll sit down with you and we'll talk about how to create a

are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stopped\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start and then there's another which is how should I collect it and it's\nVery interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kinds of things there actually\nEight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question\nHow how and when I take my Social Security\nAnd what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter] so how do you figure that oh well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you\nSo you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated you know our advisors in our firm we put we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training\nI mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy and started playing Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually\nStart when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you are going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy it increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so it\nThere's an incentive there to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what are we believed to be the reasons why you may want to wait you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to is that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it as sixty six and just give it to me [laughter] if you don't want it I'll take it [laughter]\nBut uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that uh you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well so there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy\nGenerally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy\nNow if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period\nThan we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your
