{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Bar complaint now and even the fact that she was tied into the beginning of the\nYeah and ... and ... and how many how many years ago it was a seven years ago you said correct yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it off\nWell you know I don't even make it but\nYeah you're gonna make life miserable so I did you want to you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation he's going to obviously you have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer\nOr an expert in representing a representing a you know it was representing their lawyers who represent lawyers in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I was ah oh and I I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handling the law the advice I give because some people it took me seriously\nOh All right and a relied on that so anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize\nIn this the first time out or when I was actually frightened nine now and her father so it's your call your call do I think anything's going to come to know why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the whites you were a notch\nUh being uh you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily rate there your whole anyway yes\nHi I'm wow um oh\nGod I hate these winds All right let's try it does but starting young\nWe just lost you know there shouldn't be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send a guide to the moon that doesn't work anymore in the last time there was a guy on the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're gonna be able to we can send the guy to Mars right at some point and so if he calls back he calls back All right\nOh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Kris bill yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a ... tax return from Eighteen years ago they tried to get a refund of character paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her and like sixteen years [laughter]\nI don't know how to amend a tax return that will join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around\nEither can't be found a somewhere out there on remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause uh the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules and now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your account about this\nYes and he wasn't sure of any way to do it then he had and I haven't I haven't a point where the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is ... yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise would not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course uh you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I sit and researcher look it up now I go to my account and Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several account and you make an appointment with the IRS and yet and you might occur\nDrafted that I actually just fine at my style and ah maybe not speaking to her just magically appear\nNow now I I I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her and that's when I go out\nThat many grand behind it All right that's another\nAnd they made this and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing okay\nBased on the child support order so I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that\nYeah now there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nAre cases in that state right now we're ... supposed to be around her\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rules specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or it doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you've ever look at the Internal Revenue code\nThese our phone books fit with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally cook real to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I would've said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we're in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously are on fabric All right so is there any of 'em out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow a description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life lock protects your identity and of course another hack this was Facebook fifty million accounts of course why not there isn't a person in this country has had Information Act already and it just doesn't exist so\nUh I've been a customer of life lock and I'm suggesting you look at them to a customer for ten years and they saved me from identity theft a couple of times will join me and my daughter\nAnd here's what they've done is they've added Norton Security to their program lifelong protect your identity nor is security protects your devices against virus attacks\nAnd if you have a problem with either one or they will work to fix the problem now no one could stop every\nCyber threat or prevent all id theft or monitor every transaction every business spotlight block with Norton Security that some serious enhanced protection go to white block dot com promo code handle\nThe computer models caught it ahead of time with this one we knew the signs were there but it seems to be having a little bit of trouble overcoming two factors why some wind shear which was disrupting the score and score\nAnd was blocked these huge thunderstorms and the atmosphere only to lose the top for them to the strong wind and then the other one was a visit dry air\nThat had been arrested that was disrupting in circulation at some point on Tuesday night it\nSuddenly seemed to come free from the grip the boy was holding it back and just when gang busters for several hours really transformed itself into a very ugly storm very beautiful nuclear logically speaking but ugly or Floridians and\nJust kept going what we normally see or storms that approach the Florida Panhandle and weaken\nAs they near laugh and this was the opposite it was\nBuilt intensify as it cross the beach\nThe news obviously plays up a lot of these weather events have reporters walking and flooded areas and standing in the wind in the rain just to\nIllustrate what's going on so people in other parts of the country know what's going on there is that but there is the scientific consensus that extreme weather is on the rise why are we seeing more of these big weather events\nAs we said with foreign ... it was huge and that was falling out it was doing all this crazy stuff the same thing with this one it intensified in the last few moments before it made landfall\nWhat is going on with all these extreme weather events\nWe know that we have more extreme weather events that are becoming more intense and more frequent with climate change plain and simple that is particularly cake with heat waves and heavy precipitation events it's not as clear hot with hurricanes what scientists thinker and\nIs happening and demonstrated and study is that they are becoming weather really they're producing more rainfall on average and they are either already\nGetting stronger or expected to seem more high end hurting so you might have\nFewer hurricanes in a season but a bigger percentage of them is going to be a cat for ... now that matters a lot because of the couch for ... five storms because most of the damn ... with\nBoth Florence and with the current storm you had both storms go through periods of rapid intensification that mean that it intensified by about thirty five miles an hour or ... or in twenty four hours this far exceeded\nThat baseline definition of what we think we made\n... and I say we meaning the climate community and as somebody who covers the community I pay way but really it's the scientists who are doing the work and they're saying to me we think we might be seeing a trend towards more frequent wrap it in the kitchen that the real forecast challenge\nBecause of that could be happening more frequently you could go to sleep thinking you're going to get hit by having Cory one and wake up the hit by a category for the real nightmare with this storm\nAndrew Freedman science editor for Axios extreme weather expert thank you for joining us they can ...\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nThat's one of the other huge stories of the week was this surreal moment in the Trump Administration when rapper Kanye West went to the oval office he had a meeting with the president\nAnd in truth ... fashion he just had this stream of consciousness rent it provided a lot of laughs a lot of question marks nobody knew what he was going for sometimes Miranda you're a big fan of ... yes what did you think of it\nI have not yet and brought myself to watch the full video because I still want to continue being a fan of tiny he's made it very challenging because I don't often agree with President Trump he talked about the hat\nAnd how was the Superman Cape for him but we actually have a little portion of that let's play ... at the oval office\nUh I think it's the rivalry that helps you see this game called life you know they try to scare\nMe to not where this had my own friends but this\nHas it gives me it gives me the power in a way it was something about\nOff and make you feel like Superman who made a Superman I was a hero and you may or may pay for me also got a list of ... you look around to American guy no\nNo I was going to be on it how we want to do if I say this is all a goal has done\nThe president just smiling politely at the end you say hey you know what that was very impressive and you know ... ... feels like a President Trump is a kindred spirit to him almost\nFeels like he's the same type of guy who's criticized a lot but\nCapable of doing great things we spoke to Olivia new species a Washington correspondent for New York magazine she was in the oval office when ... was there with the president said we spoke to her about her impressions of that\nAnd then she was also part of a bigger story that happened early in the week she had a private press conference with the president\nMike Pence Mike Pompeo chief of staff John Kelly and that also was another surreal moment it was the closest thing you've ever get to being a fly on the wall so when we come back from the break we'll get into that full interview with Olivia new to this is a daily dive weekend edition [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nBrand in your hand just no way that you\nWere talking about her interview with President Trump but we started off with the whole ... story and asking why he was there in the first place\n[laughter] little\nOstensibly you've been there to talk about criminal justice reform remember hits life can car dashing last including the president back in the early ... can you send in for a woman who had been in prison since like Nineteen Ninety six on a truck charge\nAnd the price will get that and I got a lot of positive press for that you have the kind of went on these rare non controversial things he did and I think that he ... and ... and that's probably cynically part of why he wants to continue hearing this sort of thing\nAnd his son in law Jared Kushner who's the top White House they buy their I'd made criminal justice reform wanted his central issues and so\nGets reported earlier this week the ... should be coming in to speak to the president and that was like main topics that they were supposed to be covering but of course ... has been out there very controversial a very openly supporting Donald Trump over the last month and booth recently on ... now wearing a make America great again hat\nWearing it everywhere and he was wearing it today and it it's really funny in the oval office I just kept thinking\nThis is so unusual because a Donald Trump does not in the ... figure skating I'm here in the oval office today and he went out the talkative person when you have a lot it if it's sort of a monologue from ... he was also not wanting burying the make America great again hat so it's very weird\nIt was so interesting watching the video because the president sitting behind a desk and he has his hands class and he's just looking at ... go off and it was just like quietly nodding his head like you said\nShe was his name straight yeah yeah the motor outlandish character in their ... just went off and it was very much like the s announcing are rents of passwords stream of consciousness and he's just going on and and he started\nOut Trump yeah from and and when the president speaks that late here though where he speaks in the stream of consciousness he touches on all different topics I mean I had that you mentioned before first hand experience it said earlier this week yeah a lot that\nI had a better view of the president whereas standing in the oval and I get a con game but I I could see them both and it was just so interesting to watch\nHow the president was just completely saddled and confused\nAt that time but what is happening I fail it I mean he did yeah almost never ...\nHe'd chime on only a couple of times you know it was about ten minutes\nAnd he spoke initially when I first walked in he was speaking he was saying that the accent I felt player who was there along the ... where it's actually a better lacrosse player and I don't know anything about sports they don't have any idea that true or not and then he started talking about\nWhat he can they can accomplish men that he talked about North Korea and I can't be so funny but when the president spoke about North Korea Kanye West responded\nThat quote I like the north Korea\n[laughter] I'm like okay I don't know I\nKnow I think maybe he meant like you like the policy on North Korea\nBut it is a funny but then yeah and it's all gone yeah\nYeah and as you mentioned you know he was warning that a make America great again hat you know he mentioned that specifically said that Donald Trump gave him the power you know made him feel like Superman it was that Superman Cape that he had he talked about that he talked about his own mental health saying\nI'm not bipolar I got another doctor to see me or something even brought on his phone we know is Casco now zero zero zero zero\nAnd he said you know can we get rid of the air force one we want to do this I point one [laughter] you\nKnow I think some people say oh is the president bleeding and the mentally ill person after after Tanya a bloody bad about himself in the oval office and I think that just\nSort of both mentally ill people people who have mental illness that it doesn't mean that they're not autonomous human beings and that they can't make their own version then that they should be baby fat or are treated as though they're not intelligent you know I think they're just simplistic productive way\nTo talk about mental illness and I saw that narrative taking off a little bit after that meeting and I found it really troubling\nYour magazine thank you very much for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nDon't forget to join us on social media daily dive Todd on Twitter and anytime Kass on these leave us a comment if it's raining and tell us the story that your interests [noise]\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts mosque rumors and this is the daily died in the [noise]\n[noise] I\nOut a little by my\nCount the balance of\nFarmers and raining down some of the top stories of the week don't forget to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nOne of the most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian causes but not\nThat had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station and two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use\nRockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old uh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space acts and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubles Russian space program\nIt's the only thing that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff that piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when USS not one cause not go up the space station there in the Soyuz spacecraft which also rides up on a rocket at the same name that was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station gr we're gonna come back\nNow the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official seal of approval on that for coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew or not to turn down didn't\nSo currently what happened is that it made it through about two minutes of flight staging first said the second stage and what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally have drugs they drink but it's been a long time since I've looked at the ... and there might have been something going on with what are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either an engine built to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the\nFirst stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nThe rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age book on our side and the ... the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have an aboard auction until much later than when you abort your ground control punches a big red button and a capsule let's go from the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely\nPowerful and just burn for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the aboard but it's like getting slammed up a block of concrete right the case\nThey said they were forced to do a ... entry what exactly does that mean because they said that during that stuff that that that have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of a what's going on under\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot and even at a normal ... year to look at it maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so\nA ballistic ridge remains ... this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nAbbas stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in it glides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle and away the shield is designed in such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ... themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways met each field so it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to\nFive sometimes six cheese a ballistic originally just means you're gone up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you had goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet in because you're not scrubbing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine cheese which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission whatever ride and what a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten afternoon and they showed some video the offense and at the point that whatever happened happened that started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you could see these two guys and our hands are flap on around like they're trying to learn how to fly over and it's really it's almost comical but realize that it was a tough ride because\nNormally that doesn't happen so they're really they said they were they were weightless at one point even before they hit the panic buttons so cut out\nNo other way now these are rushing saw use spacecrafts generally they're pretty reliable as when I said I Know they've had a couple of problems here and there but can you comment on that and then also talk about the new fleet of things that are happening 'cause SpaceX has a capsule getting ready Boeing has another one also what do we know about these\nSociety has has been flying since Nineteen sixty seven and its flown a hundred and forty five times so although that's actually not that many more than the shuttle it's been very successful they only had two crew losses back in the sixties and then after that it's had a few issues but generally it's been extremely reliable\nAnd it's been around long times Russia has launched an investigation and see what happened and they said that they're going to share all the details of with everybody because we still have a partnership with them so we'll see what the true cause of that was but thank you very much broader piled\nSpace historian author catch all of his stuff piled books dot com thank you for joining us\nSure [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nThe most concerning stories that happened this past week\nWas a report about nursing homes you know a lot of people have\nAging parents are just elderly family members and a lot of times they have no other recourse but to put them into nursing homes um the you know they might need help operating in daily life so there was a study that came out that says that some nursing home residents are increasingly spending time\nIn rehabilitation treatment during the last days of their lives are being subjected to potentially unnecessary therapies\nThat are really reaping significant financial benefits for the facilities themselves it's a thing called ultra high intensity rehabilitation and has to do with you know the amount of time that they're going through the rehab\nIt just draws all the questions that I mean the main concern is\nIf these people are in a facility and you know their elderly and you know they're reaching the end of their lives why would you put them through some of these rehabilitation techniques\nSo we saw two Riley Griffin she's a reporter for Bloomberg News and she told us all about this study and we started off by asking her what does ultra high intensity rehabilitation mean\nHand the proportion of nursing home rather than she received ultra high intensity rehab increased by a whopping ... percent between twenty trials and tiny sixteen\nAlter Heine company rehabilitation therapy is a classification that it used to get him out of treatment given to a skilled nursing home patient\nThe latest one in this line of emotional support animals is a lady flying with her pet squirrel or I'm Sorry her emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy the stories and we also talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrels and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did follow protocol by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights\nSo if it seems to be some type of policy\nOkay that could have been figured out she called in advance so he said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody ought to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had\nTo call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right and that in and of itself is a huge pain there is a fun facts I think you can share this rig the frontier airlines features a variety of animals on the tails of the\nPlane yeah so they're saying is that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar\nSame made a score of course they did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering them because we have a little bit of audio\n[noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses thirties again miniature horses seem to be why the auto wanting the question then becomes how do people get emotional support animals\nI feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better there's actually a protocol that you need to go through to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses\nNot required to accommodate them so things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed\nYou have to actually go to a mental health professional\nRight and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental illness or a motion on disability you may had and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they'd be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support him cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats\nOkay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also ah as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired are retiring soon\nUh most of our clients are over fifty and so we talk about the risks that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement to look like\nAt the same time though to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the risks that could take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about where we were on a series of the Eighteen risks based in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan ahead for that\nAnd unfortunately it is something you need to plan for now speaking of planning for stuff one of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're gonna talk about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd ah we may not be able to get through all the questions that are lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that uh you know we work as I said with people who are retired are retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life\nBuilding your investments your your net worth is job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold\nWhich is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stuff and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy\nAnd that's why you know is is that we told our clients to sell the November of ... and then just sail for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all nine we didn't say to buy until June of ...\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself overtime time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by hold through thick and thin [noise]\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired are retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show is on where we talk about how to pass onto you agree on washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten till so we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening talking about you I'm I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy or she had this submissive ... thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a ... right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email to ... we had the best\nI can\nTell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time to sweet but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's okay [noise]\nAnyway let's talk about is this a thousand and eight all over again okay so you know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October issue and all that\nAnd at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but there were dark clouds\nUh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically\nAnd at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally a sell off a cliff\nSo is this like that I'm no\nIn my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWell basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raise interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up\nIf interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars companies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week is the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff\nBut you know what it does do in my view it should be a wakeup call to you because did you know did you see how fast it fell I mean it was like what eleven hundred points in two days I mean that's fast\nThe market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly I\nMean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent didn't Y. two K. or and two

there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning and uh the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there\nSo let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are probably the most important\nA decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is when do you apply for benefits okay and it's not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two and Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits\nIf the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start\nOkay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time you start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay why wouldn't you take your sixty two\n[noise] the problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so are you have to look at your life expectancy so an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy so you\nKnow I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty\nYou know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you\nKnow we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be so the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity and by delaying you'll lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefits because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same okay so something for you to consider\nNow as I mentioned do we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired
