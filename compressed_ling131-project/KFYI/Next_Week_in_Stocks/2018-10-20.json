P. I. V. A. that standard and Poor's inactive versus active report\nThey've been putting it out now I think for Fifteen Years or so and it's a very technical very in depth review of the performance of actively managed mutual funds\nAnd it consistently shows that the vast majority of them\nFirst of all failed to outperform the index against which they compete and it shows that those who do happen now perform in year one don't continue to outperform over any reasonable period of time\nSo if you see a mutual fund in your advisor sees a mutual fund says well that one did really well the last year let's go into it plus change that's pretty much guarantee you're chasing returns pretty much guarantee that you're going to be in a a a dog that coming here because wherever they were doing that year\nDoesn't necessarily mean that they're system's going to work the following year and the statistics indicate that it doesn't\nSo first and foremost a ATF way way way less expensive literally an ATF about ten basis points on average that's the average expense ratio of our each yaps here\nI'm even after clients when clients come to us within a portfolio of mutual funds and whether or not they're paying an advisor to pick those funds for them in addition\nNine times out of ten even after they pay our feet\nThey're going to be there in ... the total cost or less here than they are inside that mutual fund and they are in each yes what is in each yeah\nIt is an index just set of numbers you and I could create an index tomorrow if we want to and it doesn't cost anything to maintain an index each yes go on with the real world and by the components the individual members of the each index\nAnd their job is to conform with the performance of that index\n[noise] so they're going to perform almost exactly as those indices do by definition\nThat's what they do [noise] whereas the mutual funds or hit and miss just won a couple of reasons why\nAre we pioneered this field and why I strongly encourage investors to use each year and why you should give us a call at forty six zero nine Ninety nine hundred and request your objective investment suit ability interview with my father attorney

he's case in your home or after he said that's John who's blink camera alerted him a burglar tried to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent to police to help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double a battle\nWe are the valleys talk station is used ... five fifty KFYI Phoenix why oh the AC to Phoenix and I are trained as all\nYo Nancy Pelosi has done this is a bipartisan thing okay pastors are Republican blows who's a Democrat\nAnd you know she's made phenomenal amounts of money because of how transportation projects have been routed through her area and places where she's on property and there's a ton of stuff like this Harry Reid's made a boatload of money on real estate by\nBuying stuff and then the other government projects in the area\nThe point I Want to make is this these people are totally divorced from the average person these people don't I don't think give a hoot about anybody but themselves in the vast majority of cases\nI understand there are exceptions there are people who are trying to do the right thing but with all due respect to be trying to do the right thing I don't know why you're running for these offices because it should be a parent to anyone who's in these offices\nThat has become a sense the impossible to do the right thing\nNow what does this have to deal with the market what I'm seeing coming in and again I don't know who's going to win elections in two thousand and Eighteen I'm not saying who should win or who I'm favoring\nBut if the Democrats win the house and a lot of people think they will\nThat that have tremendous implications to the downside for the stock market you know people talk about well you only have a divided government it tends to be good for the markets well not when the one branch of the government is spending all of his time investigating the other branch which is what's going to happen you will effectively ... two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd if you look at it was driven this market hire\nThe market first of all after inflation didn't really go much of anywhere from the year two thousand two the year two thousand and sixteen\nStarting with the election until now\nStill putting off building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider real find your loan them right for\nCall today and it gets our\n[noise]\n\n\nHi Jenna welcome back the next week and socks between the black helicopters and CNBC there's next week and next week and stocks raunchy buy online trading academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education\nAll right real quick before I get to the signs that we might be nearing the top and the market I just want to finish the kind of one thought from the last segment\nI was talking about kind of in my opinion the futility of technical analysis\nNow understand this is someone that being me who when I was learning to trade years ago went to pretty much every hotel someone are there was out there who spent and I kid you not tens and tens of thousands of dollars\nLearning about technical analysis buying software I studied the wave and the Fibonacci and all that stuff and I kid you not I couldn't talk that as well as anybody\nAnd here's what you find out when you really get into it is that it has no real predictive value\nAnd if it doesn't really have any predictable you let me let me say a few tens of thousands of course here okay\nThere's no point in spending the time and money learning something that fundamentally doesn't work and again I Would get back to if this really work why are there are hundreds of different technical indicators why they're literally an infinite number of adjustable parameters well it's because after the fact that it's really easy to say well that would have work\nBut again unless you make enough money in the markets to buy a time machine I'm not sure that's really all that valuable the next big approach that people take and I spent some money on this as well as what's called fundamental analysis\nReally studying these companies and understanding what they do and all the rest of it well the problem is first of all that relies on you knowing things other people don't know and the first question is what are you going to know the Goldman Sachs doesn't already know\nThe second thing is is that a lot of what we're told it's not that we just don't even know stuff what we know it was wrong I Would actually argue on most of these companies we have negative information because most of what we're told isn't for our benefit in fact none of it's for our benefit\nI mean think about this the market is a zero sum game and this is something I cover in class at sometimes is controversial but I Will prove it to\nThe market is a zero sum game now if the market is a zero sum game than Goldman Sachs these guys make boatloads of money which I Will show you in class as well somebody's losing boatloads of money and over time it becomes the retail trader\nAnd it's because they're acting on bad information and they're not ever understanding that well they might be wrong sometimes and the key to this whole thing is whenever you get into you know what do you want to call investment a trade or whatever\nThe first question to always ask is how bad could this be and can I live with that\nBecause of the answered that has no it doesn't matter how good it could be all that matters is can you deal with that loss and by the way the amount of money you should be willing to lose in any given investment shouldn't be any more than kind of one percent of your account\nBecause you're gonna have losers and have losers in a row is just the way the math works you may have six eight ten losers in a row even if half your trades make money\nAnd you can make a lot of money if happier trades make money okay\nBut most people can't make money even if sixty or Seventy percent of their trades make money because of the trades were they lose they lose a lot and that's the thing we have to really avoid and again this is a kind of stuff I'm going to cover in class and and just real quick for the those visas tuning in\nWhen I look at this market I see a lot of dangers in this market in the first segment I kind of talked about I think the election this fall could be really pivotal for this market I don't have a dog in the fight I don't\nYou know I can make money up or down it makes no difference to me but I think that if you have Democrats control of Congress after the fall and you may think this is the greatest thing in the world and that's not my argument my argument is I think this could have a tremendous impact on the markets and can be exceptionally negative\nBecause what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through a Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings and it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will\nIt is it is not going to inspire confidence market's dropped thrive on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the market\nWe have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly so the the class I'm going to be teaching and and by the way it totally aside from that\nThere's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nAnd I'm really getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but the to me the key is you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad as it happens way too fast and you can't react and time\nYou've got to be positioned before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the S. and P. gate backs Thirteen Years of profits in the year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand they took fourteen years to get back to his two thousand level and that was short a lotta times who takes twenty and twenty five years\nAnd people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon is thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard than for people who achieved their goals\nSo going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at\nYou know when he was buying apple at a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was by an apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money when this stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is is they invest in stocks because they think they're safe socks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day\nSeventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself yes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have losses okay if you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Next Week in Stocks", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "20"}
