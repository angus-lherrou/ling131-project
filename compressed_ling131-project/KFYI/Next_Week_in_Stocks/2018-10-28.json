{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "The fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve ... the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um ah\nThe ah by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had\nBeen achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and it has a very infant pile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper archives and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person\nThat ever started putting this this case together in this way\n[noise] ... yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year at the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder\nWas on the loose from in Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which would runner and while he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crime ... what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced\nTo have started this in Nineteen eleven there have to be earlier crime so let's try to find them now that I'm getting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got into that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nNominal lock and it is not all ... ... I had told\nMy daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would cover his track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur\nThe typical newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series\nSo uh we just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this\nBut we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nYou so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then ... excessively after that\nIt is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were some times or were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the uh I think that he while he used an axe to commit the murders\nThere are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something that\nIt's very well actually this week will be the the eighth year that I have owned the center there and uh we've come a long way and it is due to do you guys are students listeners and all all the staff to just work so hard and so again I just wanted to kind of a shout out to everybody a on the staffer\nFor just all their hard work but also\nIt made me think about what is it that we do I think maybe differently than anybody else out there in the industry that makes us so successful and I will tell you if you look at overall reviews for online training academy\nWhen students to their surveys after their their you know enroll in classes and what not what you find out that for all the online trading academies worldwide of five stars\nSeven Ninety seven point one percent of them give either four or five stars\nNow of course in Phoenix is Ninety seven point seven to but who is it [laughter] but but you know our our ... our Google a reviews we have four point nine out of five stars better Business Bureau it's five stars out of five stars\nI'm you up at four and a half hour or five stars and and we don't employ any kind of reputation management we don't pay people for reviews we don't give people discounts for right nice stop\nBut we really do make a commitment trying to help people and again going back to this idea well why am I talking about this why this important you know in in seven years of doing the show I've never really gotten into these issues but it's really the key as to why our students succeed\nIn the markets you know and I and I'm not sure I can get all these thoughts in in one show but I'm gonna try if you really think about what it is that makes people successful or not successful it's not just knowledge and there's a lot of knowledge that's important but again there's some of the knowledge during the show today\nBut there's also a lot of what I Will just call not knowledge and it has to do is processed\nIt has to do with mentoring and support and all of the pieces the puzzle that we had online training academy really really focus on but also that we in Phoenix\nHave just made it it's a huge focus of what we have done and the reason with all due respect we keep winning this award is because we kinda figured out the importance of this focus in a way I think\nAt a greater level of depth and detail and faster than what most people have come to the conclusion of but it's just but it's everything I mean it really is\nIf if our students are successful everybody wins of our students aren't successful everybody loses and so what are all the little things I mean there's the obvious stuff you can do but what are the little things that really make the difference and we've kinda gotten to a level of sophistication now where\nWe can spend a lot of time on the small stuff because we've got the big stuff down pretty well so kind of taken a big step back\nYou say what are kind of the knowledge things that people really need to know to be successful in the markets\nAnd for those of you who come to the half day classes that I teach what I'm doing is giving you an overview of these ideas but I'm also give me a lot of really really important information to understand things like for example housing market really works which by the way it is totally different than what you've been taught\nWhat everyone is hot is it is about identifying good companies and buying them and holding them forever\nAnd it's all about company earnings and you know you take the discounted cash flow of the future earnings and you own a piece that none of that is true okay it may be at one point it was true although I don't really think so but it certainly isn't true now\nIf you look at the valuations this market it has nothing to do with reality or Tesla could not have been worth more than General Motors and Ford and everything else\nThere's just no basis for others and understanding it as\nThe market is a marketing exercise now what do I mean by that what I mean is the stocks get hyped to you by people that want to sell them to you\nDon't even take a step back another part of the market that people fundamentally misunderstand is there's this belief on there that the market creates wealth and you hear this all the time since Trump's election markets credit seven trillion dollars in well\nWell that's impossible okay and if you really think it through if you biased or a stock for a hundred dollars and it goes to a hundred and fifty how much money if he made\nWell the first key is until you sell you haven't made a time okay you have to sell it to be able to make money and good investors don't buy stuff and hope the really good people and the people at the big institutions they never buy a stock and hope it goes up\nThey buy stock and they make it go up and one of the ways they make it go up is to convince you or how great the company is\nThey will tell you all these stories about things that may or may not ever happen but it will get you to buy the stock from them at a higher price than what they paid in this game is\nExactly like any other retail business it's out there the key is by something and sell it for more but the the retail trade or has been brainwashed into believing that there is an objective outside value for a company that can be known and there's not\nA share of stock is worth what someone's willing to pay for it okay it's worth what someone will sell it for that yet everything else is just story and marketing and that's the first really really important thing to understand and when you come to the the the class\nI I Will really show you example after example of this and help you understand it because it is critically important\nIf you don't understand the basic game you're planning your chance of winning is very very small so the first thing we do in the class is to really help you understand how this market works and how the marketing works and how quite frankly the manipulation works because\nIf you don't understand that again it's going to be really hard to win\nNow for those kind of new to this show I teach classes that we give tickets away here on the radio for are loyal listeners if you want to come out to the class it's going to be to reflect all the topics I'm Talking about here today starting with how does the market really work\nIf you want to come out to class you can get free tickets push will get a free tablet when you come out every\nOne of the next dozen callers the number

T. A. as in online trading academy two\nThree one nine nine six text O. T. A. as an online training academy two\nThree one nine nine six if you win tickets pleased register so we know that you're coming will have your tablet will have your lunch we'll have your seat you there [noise]\n\nHi this is Ken from online training academy Phoenix in this series of spots I'm going to debunk some common myth about the market missed four I hear a lot\nOf [noise]\n... next week and stocks between the black helicopters and CNBC there's next week ... off next week and Fox has brought you buy online training academy Phoenix\nCelebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name and professional trader education\nWell as I mentioned we've just one for the third time it's been given for the third time we just won the award as the online training academy campus\nThat does the best job of basically representing the values of the company out of forty three campuses we're the people that we do a really really good job and everybody has a really good job but we have a tremendous amount of focus on the student experience\nAnd again the words only been given three times we want it three times so we're feeling pretty good right now but if it can't be just thinking about what is it that make someone so they can succeed in the market\nAnd there's really two big pieces one there's this stuff you have to know you have to really understand what the market is you have to really understand risk management the most magical thing about the market is your ability if you know what you're doing to limit you risk when you're wrong because here's the thing all of us are wrong and all of us around a lot\nAnd the key is not losing a lot of money those times that you're wrong that how you win this game and the long run you get into trade only five things can happen and look and I know people love the word investing and they hate the word trading explained to me how you invest when you can't manage a risk\nAnd if you're buying stocks how do you manage a risk when the market's closed the stock market's only open six and a half hours a day as close Seventeen and a half hours every day as close forty eight hours every weekend your stock can move dramatically while the market's close\nSo and this is I don't want this on the way it's going to sound but how can you call yourself an investor when you can't control your risk your gambler and the vast majority of people are gambling in the markets today the problem is is it for nine years people have kind of gotten away with it because the market's just largely been going up\nThe problem is when the market goes down people get crushed and they get crushed quickly because markets fall much faster than they rise so the first thing we have to understand this reality of the market the next thing we have to understand is how do we find the highest probability entry and exit points\nNow in the last segment I talked about what would institutions you know called Goldman Sachs for sake of argument Goldman Sachs doesn't biased stock and just hope it goes up\nGoldman Sachs buys a stock and makes it go up they can make it go up a lot of ways one of the ... which is they convince you that it's a really really good stock and so they can sell it to you at a higher price they also can buy shares\nTo drive the price higher yuan mosques has been you know people don't like the word and and you know but he's been manipulating the price of his stock\nHow by going out and buying millions of shares it and that you know in a day to push the price higher and then what happens is people have been betting against the stock have to buy the stock back what's called a short squeeze that pushes the stock up further and this is what happens on a daily basis\nAnd if we think that this is all about just finding good companies and holding them forever our chances accessing the market over a lifetime of investing is very very small\nYou have periods in this market were literally for Thirty years the market after inflation doesn't really go anywhere so what we have to be able to do is not just buy it on the hope that we can sell it later\nBut the key is to identify the points where the institutions that people like the Goldman Sachs are buying and getting ready then to push it higher\nThan also understanding that when they are out of shares they can actually make money by shorting by selling stock they don't own and pushing the price down\nIf we can learn to identify those points with a high degree of probability and then manage our risk when we're wrong we have actually dealt with two of the three big issues from the knowledge perspective of the markets I'll get to the third one in a moment\nBut these are the kinds of things that we teach his eyes in class if\nThese concepts are of interest to you again I'm putting together a special class just to go through\nAll these kind of ideas that we're talking about here how do we find these entry and exit point how do we minimize or risk\nThe third point is how do we then use the leverage how do we make our money work harder for us that we worked for ...\n... the whole concept of probability risk and leverage is the key to really our approach to the market but we're going to cover a whole lot more than that and the first thing I mean he did you guys is the reality of what the what game you're applying and then you can make an intelligent decision is this a game I really want to play\nSo if you want to come out to class you can get to free tickets and you'll get a free tablet when you come out just be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T. R. A. D. E. R. that eight for for eight eight\nSeven twenty three thirty seven you can also get two tickets and a tablet plus we feed you guys lunch when you come out by the way but you can get those if you text the letters O. T. A.\nAs in online trading academy two\nThree one nine nine six tax the letters O. T. A. as in online trading academy two three one nine nine six\nIf you win tickets please registers we know you're coming otherwise we may have a seat for you we may not have your tablet I mean they have your lunch and chaos\nEnsues and we would like to get whatever Roswell so coming back to this\nThe the three main pillars of understanding how to make money in this market is understand that this is a game of probability is never a game of certainty but we can get the highest possible probability if we know what to look for\nSecondly the times that we're wrong we're going to randomly be wrong if we knew we were going to be wrong we wouldn't get into the trade so how do we minimize our losses those times were wrong\nThen how do we make our money work as hard for us as possible when you buy stock you generally have to put up at least half the money so if you buy a hundred dollar stock you have to put up you know fifty bucks in some cases you may only have to put up twenty five percent of the money but there are some rules to that\nIf you trade something my currencies you put up two percent of the money so have you on a straight a thousand dollars of a currency you literally put up twenty dollars and you can do trades where you literally put up twenty dollars\nAnd by the way when you trade something like currencies you're not dealing with things like stock through it all time highs where it's very difficult to know you know what a way where where's the top in this market\nSo so with currencies are wanted these currencies are just kind of middle of the pack right now and you can make money on these very quickly in both directions as well\nSo we want to understand what the right instrument is for us to be invested in trading in\nAnd understand again this probability risk manager and meant and using the leverage to make our money worked for us again harder than we worked for it so again these are all the kinds of ideas that we teach in our classes it's what I'm going to do if you come out to the half day classes well\nNow the next set of skills that we really want to think about is\nPeople you know think about well you know this is so specialized I'm just going to let my adviser handled this with all due respect there's some people out there that are advisors that are good people trying to do the right thing\nBut the reality is the vast majority of them are simply commission sales people they are drug reps masquerading as doctors they are selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Next Week in Stocks", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "28"}
