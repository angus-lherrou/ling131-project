{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Sound is Adia waves and and you know ... you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing audio waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost\nFor the most part they are one of the the replicate what we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know for the recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field is actors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science and goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think looks are awesome\nIf they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it\nWell you know I'm I don't know where to go for I mean that that's you know of course that's the million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the grossed hundreds unbelievers across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you\nKnow the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on in the U.S some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and ... the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the ... the debt that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions\nIs problematic for ghost research right because\nGoes can't be both inner dimensional spirits and you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that\nThat my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the day that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nThe good stuff for windows for Willis we thank\nYou for getting the information you had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can get it to you but are coming up so we're going to be talking they wear will in London so you'll want to stick around Benjamin 'cause all clear\nHe somebody you want to me out in the u._k. some time definitely thank you yeah yeah I Will tell us where we can find you and I get more information\nYeah or you can find me I'm On Facebook or been Richard I'm I uh written a dozen books my most recent one as you mentioned is investigating goes off of a podcast called squaring the strange I'm On Facebook and social media and uh\nI'm giving talks now and then so uh tracked me down and and see what I'm Talking about\nAll right and I I Hope to have you on blue rock talk some time to I'd love to okay great will get a get all your little evidence together because we can show it on there [laughter] you know it's an ... so that's cool so thank you then say ... you being with us tonight thank you so much happy will swing too yeah\nI like that he not only do I like that I I like the wheel is Wayne but I like that he likes the Willis lean I got elected he trademark and on me so I better go check that out um\nSo what we got coming up next to someone else that has never been on casinos before Paul Sinclair is his name he is um it's funny that down people said he's like the Sherlock Holmes and the u._k. and he lives in an area that is very similar to\nLike skin Walker ranch in Bermuda Triangle area and a and you know ... close to where like there was a UK rise well and uh all this crazy crazy stuff and he's just a former carpenter that now every day he does and\nStudy something investigates something else that is happening in talks to the witnesses that scene things and investigate\nStories from before and you know has an absolute ball doing a passion with it and also does everything he can have some sort of proof behind it\nSo with all the different things and he studied and all the different things that he's looked at I mean we can talk to this guy for weeks but I wanted to and lose Halloween and will is when a when you talk to him about the where walls\nThere's countless stories about where walls\nThat he is going to talk to them [noise]\nAnd they're not\nJust not just folklore people scary stuff he's got ... you can go take a look at on our website\nBecause Sam dot com and it's going to tell us and really cool stories that he has investigated more than anybody so stay with us here it's Willis lean on coast to coast than\nIt does\nAnd I don't know why any person would want to put themselves and their families through this\nI don't know I mean there's just no positions in court or anything else but I think there's going to be worth is for the vast majority of people and that means we are now going to be given a self selected group\nEssentially sociopaths and nurses is now and we've kind of had that for a while but it just is going to get significantly worse and what it means is because there is so much value in power and we've all so talked about this a lot\nNo one's going to be willing to give up this power when you have a few thousand people deciding how to split up three and a half four trillion dollars of government spending who gets to write the rules and regulations for everybody else that's a tremendous\nOn a power and these people become phenomenally wealthy there's actually a website called open secrets dot a I think it's out of work\nAnd if you go there and what you can find out is the net worth essentially if every person in Congress and you can actually track it over time and I haven't looked in a couple of years but I remember being very stunned that if you look at the\nPercentage of Congress people who essentially at least doubled their net worth while they were in Congress it was well over a third of the people\nAnd the people that had doubled their net worth\nAnd I'm not going to get the numbers exactly right but this will be close they they went from that you know worth of about one point seven million dollars to something around seven million okay and that was kind of what the average person that had doubled their wealth while they were in Congress had done and this isn't just an aggregate number of people that get skewed by a few folks\nThis was actually looking at individuals\nThey are also some individuals in Congress that claim that they actually then had negative net worth I'm which I'm not sure I really want those people making financial decisions for me but be that all is it may\nHere was the point it these people make a hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars a year sensibly and yet they're becoming phenomenally wealthy I mean do you ask questions like how did Dennis Hastert go from being a high school wrestling coach to being worth ten million dollars when he walked out of Congress\nYou'll Nancy Pelosi has done this is a bipartisan thing okay hazards Republican blows who's a Democrat\nAnd you know she's made phenomenal amounts of money because of how transportation projects have been routed through her area and places where she's on property and there's a ton of stuff like this Harry Reid's made a boatload of money on real estate by buying stuff and then the other government projects in the area\nThe point I Want to make is this these people are totally divorced from the average person these people don't I don't think give a hoot about anybody but themselves in the vast majority of cases I understand there are exceptions there are people who are trying to do the right thing but\nWith all due respect if you're trying to do the right thing I don't know why you're running for these offices because it should be a parent to anyone who's in these offices that has become a sense the impossible to do the right thing\nNow what does this have to do with the market what I'm seeing coming in and again I don't know who's going to win the elections in two thousand and Eighteen I'm not saying who should win or who I'm favoring but\nIf the Democrats win the house and a lot of people think they will\nThat that have tremendous implications to the downside for the stock market you know people talk about well you only have a divided government it tends to be good for the markets well not when the one branch of the government is spending all of his time investigating the other branch which is what's going to happen you will effectively ... two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd if you look at it was driven this market hire\nThe market first of all after inflation didn't really go much of anywhere from the year two thousand two the year two thousand and six teen\nStarting with the election until now now there are some tremendous gains in the market although it's still only give you about four percent a year and kind of capital gain not again that's not even factoring in inflation so still hasn't been great but it's gotten somewhat better\nPart of the reason is is there's this belief that taxes will continue to come down that regulation will be more under control\nAnd if we spent two years investigating and the most ruthless manner possible which is what I see coming investigating the president I'm not sure that's going to be good for markets and the question is what do we do about it\nNow I'm going to talk about a number of other factors that are out there but there's a lot of things that are kind of screaming that we're really close to a top in this market so the class it ought to be teaching is before\nThe crash it's going to be strategies both to the market ... to go up as well as protection strategies and very importantly strategies for making money when the market goes down if you want to come to class and the teacher personally you can get to

T. A. as in online training academy two\nThree one nine nine that when we come back from break we're going to talk about some things that indicates that we might be getting pretty close to a top of the market and one of the some of the stuff you really should be watching out for that again you can then figure out how to protect yourself and make money to downsize CNN [noise]\n\nHi this is Ken from online training academy Phoenix in this series of spots I'm going to debunk some common market Mr Smith three the cutest thing [noise] [noise]\n\nHi this is Ken and we'll come back to the next week and socks between the black helicopters\nAnd CNBC says next week and next week to ... buy online trading academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years since the world's most trusted name in professional trader education\nAll right real quick before I get to the signs that we might be during the top and the market I just want to finish the kind of one thought from the last segment\nI was talking about kind of in my opinion the futility of technical analysis now understand this is someone that being me\nWho when I was learning to trade years ago went to pretty much every hotel seminar there was out there who spent and I kid you not tens and tens of thousands of dollars\nLearning about technical analysis buying software I studied the Eliot waving the Fibonacci and all that stuff and I kid you not I couldn't talk that as well as anybody\nAnd here's what you find out when you really get into it is that it has no real predictive value\nAnd if it doesn't really have any predictable you let me let me say tens of thousands of course here okay\nThere's no point in spending the time and money learning something that fundamentally doesn't work and again I Would get back to if this really work why are there are hundreds of different technical indicators why they're literally an infinite number of adjustable parameters well it's because after the fact that it's really easy to say well that would have work\nBut again unless you make enough money in the markets to buy a time machine I'm not sure that's really all that valuable\nThe next big approach that people take and I spend some money on this as well as what's called fundamental analysis really studying these companies and understanding what they do and all the rest of it\nWell the problem is first of all that relies on you knowing things other people don't know and the first question is what are you going to know the Goldman Sachs doesn't already know the second thing is is that\nA lot of what we're told it's not that we just don't even know stuff what we know it was wrong I Would actually argue on most of these companies we have negative information because most of what we're told isn't for our benefit in fact none of it's for our benefit I mean think about this\nThe market is a zero sum game and this is something I cover in class at sometimes as controversial but I Will prove it to\nThe market is a zero sum game now if the market is a zero sum game\nThan Goldman Sachs and these guys make boatloads of money which I Will show you in class as well somebody's losing boatloads of money and over time it becomes the retail trader\nAnd it's because they're acting on bad information and they're not ever understanding that well they might be wrong sometimes and the key to this whole thing is whenever you get into you know what do you want to call investment a trade or whatever\nThe first question to always ask is how bad could this be and can I live with that\nBecause of the answered that has no it doesn't matter how good it could be\nAll that matters is can you deal with that loss and by the way the amount of money you should be willing to lose in any given investment shouldn't be any more than kind of one percent of your account\nBecause you're gonna have losers have losers in a row it's just the way the math works you may have six eight ten losers in a row even have half your trades make money\nAnd you can make a lot of money if happier trades make money okay\nBut most people can't make money even if sixty or Seventy percent of their trades make money because of the trades were they lose they lose a lot and that's the thing we have to really avoid and again this is a kind of stuff I'm going to cover in class and and just real quick for the those views tuning in when I look at this market\nI see a lot of dangers in this market in the first segment I kind of talked about I think the election this fall could be really pivotal for this market\nI don't have a dog in the fight I don't you know I can make money up or down it makes no difference to me but I think that if you have Democrats control of Congress after the fall and you may think this is the greatest thing in the world and that's not my argument my argument is I think there's going to have a tremendous impact on the markets and can be exceptionally negative\nBecause what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through a Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings and it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will it it is\nI could inspire confidence market's dropped thrive on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the
