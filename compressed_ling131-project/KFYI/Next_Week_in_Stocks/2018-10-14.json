{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "But right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and\nI wasn't worried about anything anymore\nMm sounds he so tense peaceful and he's is what it was exactly hateful\nHave you been able to recreate that experience I'm not going to attack the feeling that experience a peace\n[noise]\nNo I Wish I could add would actually be great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame each\nYeah absolutely and one of the things that people do report when they have and out of body experience um is that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace and fly that just flows through them mhm\nUh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people reported\nLike their entry into a sea of of love and um and acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even the there is no words to even describe some of these things\n'cause they're beyond our um our verb itch but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do have a explore these experiences so they can uh much shift say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n... now and thank you very much ... ... I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience and it'll be is it is not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ...\nIf you're a fear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a double a or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have like you made likely have a negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space and that's what people forget and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers\nOf non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you do see experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative energy if if there is not like there's negative entered its you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well\nWell you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had lived one once where I went it was a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got us in the recycling helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone did I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle and he was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was benign and with no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened in ... it was as yes\nTen and two thousand and sixteen for sixteen years actually going on Seventeen years the stock market return less than a half a percent a year once you factor inflation and that's when things you know we're getting up to all time highs what were at higher\nAll time highest now but the market still up less than four percent a year not even factoring in inflation over the last Eighteen years and again you know how is asking the question\nIf in the all time longest bull market in history\nIn a market that is twenty five percent more highly valued than it was in two thousand and seven and a market that is running on cheer debt from what I can tell and by the way that is getting more expensive which is one of the issues is coming along here\nIf you haven't achieved your financial goals with the strategies you're using now weddings ... going to happen what are we really expect the market to do from here to do we think is going to double is it gonna triple I mean anything is possible but my one of my favorite phrases life is anything's possible\nBut very few things actually yeah but a ... and are we really willing to bet everything that we own our future on well things are just kind of cute keep doing what they're done for the last nine years\nNow again it doesn't mean the market has to fall apart tomorrow but to get back to the theme of the show the problem with believing bad numbers is you make bad decisions and it's not just people as investors were I'm tying this too is the Federal Reserve\nOne of the things that happened is the chairman of the Federal Reserve came out last week and this is from Goldman Sachs report and basically the court is as fed chair Powell stated in his speech last week the national association for business economics the outlook is quote remarkably positive\nIn fact the unemployment rate released this morning fold the three point seven percent the lowest rate and fifty years and he goes on to talk about these are the statistics of how great things are\nSo why does this matter it matters because the markets being driven by cheap money it's individuals buying stock on margin again people borrowed more than three percent of the entire US Economy to buy stocks\nCompanies have been borrowing money to buy back their own stock to support the stock prices\nOlder Americans are being forced into riskier investments I eat the stock market later and later in life because they can't get rates of return anywhere else\nBecause of this they're taking risk that they can't recover from if things go wrong at any point and again the likely cases something's going to all wrong at some point it's just human history kind of tells us that's what's going to happen\nBut when the fed is looking at this nursing the data that says everything is firing on all cylinders what are they doing they're making money more expensive\nAnd if you make money more expensive and the market is built on cheap money and the economy is built on cheap money and the housing market is built on cheap money and the government finances are built on cheap money and all of a sudden there is a cheap money anymore\nIt is not unlikely that there will be a problem and this is where the believing your own spin and believing your bad data is going to cause an awful lot of problems for an awful lot of people so in today's show we're going to get into like\nAll of these ideas will get into the stats and detail we'll talk about why I don't think there's been growth in this country for decades we're going to talk about what this raising of rates means but overall comes back to this fundamental point\nThis market is price for perfection the multiples on this market are higher than the ban again any time but maybe once or twice in history can they go higher sure\nAgain anything is possible but if we live in what is most probable and we have to deal with life in terms of probabilities\nThe probability is the buying hold investor is probably not going to do great for the next eight to ten years and in fact they may lose substantial sums of their money and depending on their timing or almost guaranteed to lose substantial sums of their money because if you try to get out when the market's down\nYou're just going to lock it in the law says she's got to be able to deal with the market before then so the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash profit and protection strategies for any market\nAnd again what I teach in this class is the fundamentals of how you make money in any market\nHow do you buy low and so high how do you know what high and low is because the key is is the big institutions like the Goldman Sachs is to not buy stocks and hope they go up\nThey buy them and they make them go up to what we try to teach you guys is how to identify what did the stocks are buying into what prices are buying them so that you can participate in that same upside\nYou also then could see where they're selling them and participate in the downside not just try to not lose money but actually make money on the move down\nIf you want

celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education [noise] All right this week we're talking about on the show we've talked a lot in the past about\nHow I just don't believe any has just extend it's not just because I'm skeptical although I'm skeptical person if they don't make any sense and if you think about it for about five minutes she's oh well this is absurd why do we believe these things\nBut we're taking a step further on the show which is so why why does anyone care why does it matter well if your fundamental view of the economy is strong it's growing in earnings are good\nThen you're going to behave in a certain way\nAnd if you realize is that this is a Potemkin village and we're making things look good by borrowing from future demand to make things look good today but to do that we have to borrow a bunch of money in borrowing money is getting more expensive and therefore we're getting closer to the end of this you maybe have been a very different way\nWhen the chairman of the Federal Reserve comes out and says hey we have three point seven percent unemployment and his quote is that the ... the outlook for the economy is remarkably positive\nThen he's going to view changes in interest rates and changes in what's called quantitative tightening very differently then again if he realizes is all just smoke and mirrors or due to budget cuts and now we're going to operate just on ...\nI was I was in a favorite cartoon samurai saw that but it's great so at any rate so what we talked about and also in the last segment is\nKay ... the key to this is what makes a modern economy workers debt alright there's the the economy the United states is having to borrow three to four dollars every year to get a dollars worth of growth so one of the reasons I don't believe the statistics is is that really gross\nSee actual growth comes from two things the number of people working and how much stuff they can make an hour well we have Ninety five million people in this country not working and productivity basically isn't changing anywhere in the world except you know underdeveloped countries\nSo if we don't have more people working and we don't have the people working making more stuff how do you have growth\nWell you know you mascot by borrowing huge sums of money inefficient lay in order to try to bring demand forward in order to try to be able to make things look better than they really are which again has been going on now for decades this isn't a Trump thing this is an Obama thing it's not even a Bush thing\nThis has been going on since Reagan at a minimum okay and you may even argue before then so if you have a world in which there isn't any real growth and it's all being driven by that Kim continuing to grow the debt is critically important to making things continue to look good\nWell there are two things you need to continue to grow debt one is willing borrowers and one is willing lenders and both of that those people require\nFaith that things are going well are getting better if that mindset changes then all of a sudden all hell breaks loose and you end up with what you had in two thousand and eight or two thousand\nWhen all of a sudden there's a change in psychology and that's the thing that we have to be careful of what I was talking about in the last segment is the biggest risk to change in psychology is\nAll of a sudden Democrats take control of the house and again not a political statement you may think that's the greatest in the world that's not my point\nMy point is there will be two years of investigations of anyone who's ever stayed as the Trump Hotel anyone who's ever use the word Trump playing bridge that's them out of its\nOkay that'd be a big there'll be bridged players will be for no Trump will be on their science for for my red flares up there\nSo at any rate ... it's going to be chaos okay it's going to be division you think again the Kavanaugh step was bad this will be a whole nother level okay now again you may think that's great you may think Trump's evil all the rest of it not my argument my\nArgument is is that's not going to be good for the economy and it's not going to be good for the market because the confidence will be lost the other thing playing into that is the fact that interest rates are going up in a market that's built on debt and is built on cheap money and built on bringing in demand from the future to today\nIt Monday becomes more expensive that becomes a lot less lucrative for people to do I mean if you can borrow money one or two percent your big us company\nAnd you can buy back your own stock and management makes themselves rich by doing this the board make some money 'cause they owned company stock everybody keeps their jobs everybody's happy it's fantastic I mean it just it it kind of take a step back on that\nThis year companies will buy back more of their stock than any time in us history okay the estimate is issues are going to buy back about one point two trillion dollars in stock\nNow that helps the stock market for many reasons one is it reduces the number of outstanding shares\nAnd the market stock prices move based on supply and demand and one of the things they're doing is they're taking away supply\nAnd if people have to invest in the stock market because they can't get decent rates anywhere else when you reduce the supply if you had the same amount of demand what would happen to price will price would go up well but you have more demand\nBecause people are so far far behind where they need to be for retirement that they're staying in the market and taking more and more risk\nAnd later in life when they have less and less time to recover because what's the alternative again go buy bonds\nGo find a new witty and pay eight and a half percent commissions and then get a lousy really return and tie up your money when you can't get it out with massive penalties for years is that really the answer and and and for most people the answer's no okay I mean ten years ago we had a million bucks you could buy a Thirty Years' she did get paid to five percent\nYet fifty grand a year yet some Social Security ... you're not living the life but you're doing OK\nOkay today you go buy a Thirty Years' city I mean a lot of places you're looking at one and a quarter percent\nSo you know your your million bucks gives you a twelve thousand five hundred dollars a year your Social Security is given you last year the average person actually this year average person got an increase in Social Security of twenty eight bucks a month\nI'm In February ... get a whole dollar a month right but it was a lot better than the year before we got four bucks for the year before that when you get anything\nSo people are sitting here going\nI'm so far behind where I Need to be the stock market's been doing great I'm going to buy in and then they hear that the economy's doing well and the here that earnings are up and they hear that unemployment is down and they say this is safe\nIt isn't safe and it isn't safe because the key to the market is buying cheap and so and when it's expensive\nAnd the market right now is ridiculously expensive again on almost any metric I've ever seen historically just as a second or third most expensive market in history and drew for you to justify those prices you have to believe we are on the verge of some great renaissance and I don't see it\nYou got a third of the country not working and again how do you have three point seven percent unemployment what Ninety five million people aren't even looking for work okay how can that possibly be\nWell it's because of how we do the stats and the way we do the stats doesn't make any sense as long as someone doesn't look for work or not unemployed\nOkay so if no one in this country had a job and nobody was looking for work the unemployment rate would be zero it would be Nirvana\nOkay except that we would all be broke\nThis is unfortunately again a part of my whole point on\nIf you don't understand the fundamentals of how these numbers are done or even like the inflation numbers inflation numbers are totally insane\n... when the calculated inflation they assumed that every person United States wants their house okay\nAnd then they assume that they basically they make it up okay well we think this house would rent for this much and that's how much we're going to charge you for it I mean seriously that's how they do this and and it's like forty percent of of the CPI the consumer price index is tied to housing costs as which are totally made up oh and by the way", "show_name": "Next Week in Stocks", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day":
