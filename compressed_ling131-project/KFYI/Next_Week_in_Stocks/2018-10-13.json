I'm\nHere I'm asking I'm going to be asking the same question to different ways first I ask what's the maximum temporary decline in portfolio value that you'd be willing to accept in pursuit of your longer term investment objectors and by temporary I mean a period of up to a year or two\nAnd then I asked them to define it less than five percent and incidentally they say less than five percent they're automatically either in one of our most conservative portfolios or are they ought to just be a saver and accept\nThe brutal treatment are going to get down at the bank when they buy a CD [noise]\nUm or they say are these are options I can accept up to a year or two a five to ten percent decline I can accept a ten to Fifteen Percent decline I can accept that Fifteen to twenty percent decline\nOr I'd be willing to accept even more than twenty per cent decline value if I felt we were on the right track and that leads us to\nHow long would you be willing to wait a or excuse me willing to wait out a downward fluctuation this is really the same questions ... ... yeah but historically our clients who stick with their personal ah portfolios\nOr after a market decline have seen the value of their portfolios recovered in fact even without my defense of intervention though like we are back office is called efficient market advisors we were very very close with them closely with them\nAnd I'm Bill even their most aggressive portfolio took less than two calendar years to recover after two thousand eight that's even without my defensive intervention\nThe U.S in the five hundred took five and a quarter years to recover after two thousand eight\nSo I wouldn't characterize any of these poor fall is frankly is wildly wildly volatile a and they haven't they historically have demonstrated a a decent recovery capability\nBut we asked this question how long would you be willing to way down to fluctuate Dahmer fluctuation less than a year one to two years two to three years three to five years as long as it takes\nNow if someone in the previous question has said hey I'm willing to accept a Fifteen to twenty percent downside no problem for one to two years and then they come back and I've asked the question a different way and they say\nI'm willing to weigh less than a year to get back to break even well guess what we've got ourselves in inconsistency don't like something obviously need to discuss yeah\nNow there is the correct answer to this question there as a way where you can bury your portfolio to the essence of the five hundred or another index\nAnd there's only one correct answer to this one that's the only trick question and the whole process and the correct answers I don't care about are performing the S. and P. or any other index I care about accomplishing my investment objectives with as little risk as possible along the way it's called personal finance personal\nExactly exactly let's define what you do the complex let's find the level of risk than it was soon walk out of your knowing someone who's got you back we asked the question at the top of the show where is your advice or are they hiding\nTwenty five emails to clients since may [noise] six emails to find since the beginning of this month [noise] always available to answer a question\nThat's what we're about your new advisor\nIs that support talent center Scottsdale shopper I wrote and I don't forget your capital Capital Management says don't forget please give us a call at forty six oh nine Ninety nine hundred request your objective investment suit ability interview with my father attorney certified financial planner pizza green\nNow visit us at ... dot com rate info and all our past shows are posted there now it's the only degree Capital Management and county I we tighten your low cost the F investing to access all\nThe world's most promising markets that the green dot com foray into six zero nine Ninety nine hundred minimum portfolios five hundred thousand ... next week love you buy\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan that is right for\nCall today and let's get started\nWe all know people all around us that are having some hard times losing a job or losing your home and we're about how many have can move just to look for work terrible to lose your home for many there are also losing a loved family member\nThese dogs don't understand what's happening to them [noise] fortunately there are wonderful people who do the people and the rescue clubs of the American kennel clubs the largest network of rescue groups and volunteers throughout America\nAnd they rescued all kinds of dogs not just pure ... good people and the AKC find forever homes for all kinds of breach and it gives people one less thing to worry about knowing if their pets are going to a caring find out more [noise] go to a K.

next week in stock next week and Fox has drawn to buy\nOnline training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we're talking about the show we've talked a lot in the\nPast about how I just don't believe in is is just extend it's not just because I'm skeptical although I'm skeptical\nPerson if they don't make any sense and if you think about it for more than about five minutes she's oh well this is absurd why do we believe these things\nBut we're taking a step further on the show which is so why why does anyone care why does it matter well if you're a fundamental view of the economy is is strong it's growing in earnings are good then you're going to behave in a certain way\nAnd if you realize is that this is a Potemkin village and we're making things look good by borrowing from future demand to make things look good today but to do that we have to borrow a bunch of money in borrowing money is getting more expensive and therefore we're getting closer to the end of this you maybe have been a very different way\nWhen the chairman of the Federal Reserve comes out and says hey we have three point seven percent unemployment and his quote is that the ... the outlook for the economy is remarkably positive\nThen he's going to view changes in interest rates and changes in what's called quantitative tightening very differently then again if he realizes is all just smoke and mirrors or due to budget cuts and now we're going to operate just on matters of\nThat was I was in a favorite cartoon so I remember I saw that but it's great so at any rate so what we talked about and also in the last segment is\nKay ... the key to this is what makes a modern economy workers debt alright there's the the economy the United states is having to borrow three to four dollars every year to get a dollars worth of growth so one of the reasons I don't believe the statistics is is that really gross\nSee actual growth comes from two things the number of people working and how much stuff they can make an hour well we have Ninety five million people in this country not working and productivity basically isn't changing anywhere in the world except for real you know underdeveloped countries\nSo if we don't have more people working and we don't have the people working making more stuff how do you have growth\nWell you know you mascot by borrowing huge sums of money inefficient lay in order to try to bring demand forward in order to trying to be able to make things look better than they really are which again has been going on now for decades this isn't a Trump thing this is an Obama thing it's not even a Bush thing\nThis has been going on since Reagan at a minimum of ... and you may even argue before then\nSo if you have a world in which there isn't any real growth and it's all being driven by that Kim continuing to grow the debt is critically important to making things continue to look good\nWell there are two things you need to continue to grow debt one is willing borrowers and one is willing lenders and both of that those people require\nFaith that things are going well are getting better if that mindset changes then all of a sudden all hell breaks loose and you end up with what you had in two thousand and eight or two thousand\nWhen all of a sudden there's a change in psychology and that's the thing that we have to be careful of what I was talking about in the last segment is the biggest risk to change in psychology is\nAll of a sudden Democrats take control of the house and again not a political statement you may think that's the greatest in the world that's not my point\nMy point is there will be two years of investigations of anyone who's ever stayed as the Trump Hotel anyone who's ever use the word Trump playing bridge that's them out of its\nOkay that'd be a big there'll be bridged players will be for no Trump will be on their science for for my red flares up there\nSo at any rate ... it's going to be chaos okay it's going to be division you think again the Kavanaugh step was bad this will be a whole nother level okay now again you may think that's great you may think Trump's evil all the rest of it not my argument my\nArgument is is that's not going to be good for the economy and it's not going to be good for the market because the confidence will be lost the other thing playing into that is the fact that interest rates are going up in a market that's built on debt and is built on cheap money and built on bringing in demand from the future to today\nIf money becomes more expensive that becomes a lot less lucrative for people to do I mean if you can borrow money one or two percent your big us company\nAnd you can buy back your own stock and management makes themselves rich by doing this the board make some money 'cause they owned company stock everybody keeps their jobs everybody's happy it's fantastic I mean it just it it kind of take a step back on that\nThis year companies will buy back more of their stock than any time in us history okay the estimate is issues are going to buy back about one point two trillion dollars in stock\nNow that helps the stock market for many reasons one is it reduces the number of outstanding shares\nAnd the market stock prices move based on supply and demand and one of the things they're doing is they're taking away supply\nAnd if people have to invest in the stock market because they can't get decent rates anywhere else when you reduce the supply if you had the same amount of demand what would happen to price will price would go up well but you have more demand\nBecause people are so far far behind where they need to be for retirement that they're staying in the market and taking more and more risk later and later in life when they have less and less time to recover because what's the alternative again go buy bonds\nGo by an annuity and pay eight and a half percent commissions and then get a lousy ready to return and tie up your money when you can't get it out with massive penalties for years is that really the answer and and and for most people the answer's no okay I mean ten years ago if you had a million bucks you could buy a Thirty Years' CD page five percent\nYet fifty grand a year yet some Social Security ... you're not living the life but you're doing OK okay today you might have thirty or CD I mean a lot of places you're looking at one and a quarter percent\nSo you know your your million bucks gives you twelve thousand five hundred dollars a year your Social Security is giving you the last year the average person actually this year average person got an increase in Social Security of twenty eight bucks a month\nI'm In February ... get a whole dollar a month right but it was a lot better than the year before we got four bucks a year before that when you get anything\nSo people are sitting here going so far behind where I Need to be the stock market's been doing great I'm going to buy in and then they hear that the economy's doing well and the here that earnings are up and they hear that unemployment is down and they say this is safe\nIt isn't safe and it isn't safe because the key to the market is buying cheap and so and when it's expensive and the market right now is ridiculously expensive again on almost any metric I've ever seen\nHistorically just as a second or third most expensive market in history and drew for you to justify those prices you have to believe we are on the verge of some great renaissance and I don't see it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Next Week in Stocks", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "13"}
