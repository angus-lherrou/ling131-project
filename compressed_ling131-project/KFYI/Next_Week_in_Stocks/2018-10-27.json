{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Right now reporting companies are beating the earnings estimates so far this quarter with two hundred and forty out of five hundred companies in the U.S and the reporting\nOn the s in peace twelve month forward pie eat the price multiple uh investors willing to pay for the SPs projected earnings twelve months from now is already at right at about its historic average\nNow this means that truly America's most popular index for example the S. and P. and many others are fairly priced despite rising race not all of them are but some of them so again it's all about the fed getting the heck out of the way for a while and you think on top of that at the terrorist as well [noise]\nWell there are a few companies that had been hit hard by sheriff's and I'm willing to accept caterpillars explanation the terrorists are starting to hurt them a little bit uh but honestly I think that many companies as they provide earnings guidance for the quarter and you're ahead are using tariffs as an excuse not not a reason\nIt's better from their perspective to list the downside and then exceed the very expectations low expectations that they themselves are now could it be possible that they're doing this to tank their stock so they can buy it back\nAt a lower price yeah that's true too although they're not allowed to admit that I don't want yeah of course how the gaff rules that will remember too that marketers do markets penalize really penalize blue sky the value of your stock\nSo if a CEO gets on a quarterly conference call says yeah I really think boy this next quarter is gonna be gray must have and they failed yeah unless you asked them um and they failed to list the things that might hold them back\nThen they get sued by in all kinds of a active but shareholder activists tried so it's always better to understate your case anyway but yeah probably in the back of their mind they're thinking I you know I Hope that the stock price days relatively low\nOr until we can get out there and by our stock back yeah for every member they can't do that until they issued their quarterly earnings\nSo they'll say oh we're going to the terrorists are going to affect our business and they're they're going to issue lower guidance sock goes down ten percent bam they're buying it right back then they beat the guidance that they issued right right they make money when I went out do you believe that the president should stick\nWith the ... I I Do think he should stick with a generally I also think though that he can be more targeted by sanctioning the specific individuals and companies abroad that are violating the law and dumping products here or stealing our technology and so on\nBut I also believe that we are in a long term and I mean long term battle with communist China\nLet's not forget we're not talking about China we're talking about communist China I don't mean to be dramatic but freedom hangs in the balance I really believe this seriously free enterprise free enterprise and state sponsored enterprise are incompatible period\nThe Chinese government as a matter of policy wise sheets and steals it subsidizes companies in order to dominate industries worldwide and solicits investors from the free world us to invest in those companies I've mentioned this before\nThe old communist saying is we will hang the capitalist and he will sell us the rope in fact in fact when we invest in companies owned by the communist Chinese government we are not selling them the wrote\nWe are buying them the rope\nThat's why not long ago and and before we went entirely to cash in our emerging markets position\nWe switch from an ATF that held many state owned enterprises or to why an emerging markets each year that that help many state owned enterprises to one where state ownership is kept to an absolute minimum and I might add the ... out performing those with an abundance so that's always\nSo what's the big takeaway here\nWell first I very broad question but no no I ... I think our bottom line here for our discussion so far I'm too thanks number one I Do think that us equity markets are fully capable of rebounding quickly after the election especially west but also without\nA little help from the fed\nThe second big takeaway is because we sold our international equity positions on October twelve\nThe impact on our portfolios for our clients of the world wide sell off has been reduced but not eliminate this is watch the proactive management of a worldwide portfolio of passive index tracking ATF looks like when it's done right dad what do\nYou see in the future and say six months out what kinds of things do you see this trade war resolving do you see interest rates rising if both of them what\nWhat what kind of scenarios where I can I first of all I still tend to believe that around the end of the year we will reach some level of agreement with um\nThe European Union an automobile uh imports for example that's a big deal especially for Germany is one of the big reasons right now the German indexes down um you got to remember that we our economy is eighty percent domestic twenty percent\nUm international knows we rely twenty percent on exports for our GDP\nOur Ehsan ... arches me or dial companies rely thirty over thirty percent on exports that's why there are more sensitive to what's going on in the rest of the world than say for example small kept\nThe uh ... what I see happening is that getting resolved and then democratic countries getting together and starting to work on China\nOn a collective front they're already doing a lot of that and I think they're going to do more and what's more I see bipartisan support for this I see bipartisan support for this um which is a great thing to finally find something that both parties can agree on\nHow long do you think China can hold out they're going to try to hold out beyond Donald Trump reasonably hold that you think they can do I know I don't know I don't I don't think\nNo I think there's going to be more people there remember this is a country where there are more than a million people the leakers\nI'm a religious nomination much a Muslim sect better in that are in concentration camps they call them re education camps they are there without trial they were there they are there without charges\nThey are they ... most of them don't even know why they're there on except that maybe they're related to someone that was on their governments watch list so they all get brought in deprived of\nTheir ... over a million people these folks who you're trying to do business with and to hear the president and his administration\nSay we're not going to go back to the table with these people until they come to us good good their economy not withstanding sheriff's is a mess it's highly leverage and I realize there can be repercussions worldwide bottom line though is that this is a long term struggle\nNow it doesn't sound like we should do business with them but it does sound like you should do business with us now don't forget please give us a call ... and I was I just yeah that was really prepared for that one of Li's give us a call authority to six oh nine

we've just one for the third time it's been given for the third time we just won the award as the online training academy campus\nThat does the best job of basically representing the values of the company out of forty three campuses we're the people that we do a really really good job and everybody has a really good job but we have a tremendous amount of focus on the student experience\nAnd again the words only been given three times we want it three times so we're feeling pretty good right now but if it can't be just thinking about what is it that make someone so they can succeed in the market\nAnd there's really two big pieces one there's this stuff you have to know you have to really understand what the market is you have to really understand risk management the most magical thing about the market is your ability if you know what you're doing to limit you risk when you're wrong because here's the thing\nAll of us are wrong and all of us around a lot\nAnd the key is not losing a lot of money those times that you're wrong that's how you win this game in the long run\nYou get into trade only five things can happen and look and I know people love the word investing and the hate the word trading explained to me how you invest when you can't manage a risk\nAnd if you're buying stocks how do you manage a risk when the market's closed the stock market's only open six and a half hours a day as close Seventeen and a half hours every day as close forty eight hours every weekend your stock can move dramatically while the market's close\nSo ... and this is I don't want this on the way it's going to sound but how can you call yourself an investor when you can't control your risk your gambler and the vast majority of people are gambling in the markets today the problem is is it for nine years people kind of gotten away with it because the market's just largely been going up\nThe problem is that when the market goes down people get crushed and they get crushed quickly because markets fall much faster than they rise so the first thing we have to understand this reality of the market\nThe next thing we have to understand is how do we find the highest probability entry and exit points now in the last segment I talked about what would institutions you know called Goldman Sachs for sake of argument ... doesn't biased stock and just hope it goes up\nGoldman Sachs buys a stock and makes it go up they\nCan make it go up a lot of ways one of the ... which is they convince you that it's a really really good stock and so they can sell it to you at a higher price\nThey also can buy shares to drive the price higher yuan mosques has been you know people don't like the word and and you know but he's been manipulating the price of his stock\nHow by going out and buying millions of shares it and that you know in the day to push the price higher and then what happens is people have been betting against the stock have to buy the stock back what's called a short squeeze that pushes the stock up further and this is what happens on a daily basis\nAnd if we think that this is all about just finding good companies and holding them forever our chances excess in the market over a lifetime of investing is very very small\nYou have periods in this market were literally for Thirty years the market after inflation doesn't really go anywhere so what we have to be able to do is not just buy it on the hope that we can sell it later\nBut the key is to identify the points where the institutions that people like the Goldman Sachs are buying and getting ready then to push it higher than\nAlso understanding that when they are out of shares they can actually make money by shorting by selling stock they don't own and pushing the price down\nIf we can learn to identify those points with a high degree of probability and then manage our risk when we're wrong we have actually dealt with two of the three big issues from the knowledge perspective of the markets I'll get to the third one in a moment\nWith these are the kinds of things that we teach his eyes in class if these concepts are of interest to you again I'm putting together a special class just to go through all these kind of ideas that we're talking about here how do we find these entry and exit point how do we minimize or risk\nThe third point is how do we then use the leverage how do we make our money work harder for us we worked for ...\n... the whole concept of probability risk and leverage is the key to really our approach to the market but we're going to cover a whole lot more than that and the first thing I mean he did you guys is the reality of what the what game you're applying and then you can make an intelligent decision is this a game I really want to play\nSo if you want to come out to class you can get to free tickets and you'll get a free tablet when you come out just be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T. R. A. D. E.
