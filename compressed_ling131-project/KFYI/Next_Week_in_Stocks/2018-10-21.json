{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "So we set up blockades are around around Germany so we couldn't we couldn't feed them running a food so you see these emaciated photos of people in concentration camps which has tremendous weight horrible I'm you know you had to make a decision to do I feed my soldiers or do I feed my prisoners\nSo that's the other side of the history that people don't really get we had already broken the Japanese POWs I had a conversation about this with Oliver Stone twenty Thirteen he came out with a series the other side of history I Believe a DVD sir\nYes yes he came to the exact same thing in this book was was in the middle of writing this back then are researching it always is I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just a matter of one that\nHad happened\nAnd so again or or did he let it happen duty while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much more knowledge do you think\nHe had the actual attack\nIt's difficult to tell I Know they had at least a week's notice and you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor\nSo they were not at Pearl Harbor when the attack happened which is a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty necessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where are you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting so it was a pretty good evidence to support that the you know the same you know to support\nThat conclusion let's say they definitely had a as a matter of fact\nThe History Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel\nThey even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find in the archive that suggests that that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought wow hey look at that you know I mean I I I knew I got it right but I didn't know how to write I got it so that was ... I was right on the money with the right\nBut as you as you are and make great pains to point out and he just mentioned this earlier that the Germans are in their T. V. to rocket program\nUh almost you know they were getting close to being able to deliver um nuclear bombs and had the United states not got\nA when they did it may have been too late and imagine nuclear weapons attached to those would be to rockets raining down on on England\nYou know it's incredible uh it's just absolutely incredible when you think about the situation um you know America is an economic chaos they know they have to get into this war for many reasons to the to spark the economy as well and uh it was just in the he had the FBI was putting a real bad situation\nAnd you know in the first chapter of my book I paint FDR is kind of a villain and I have to do that to set up and murder so I Apologize in advance for anybody reads and gets her time with them [laughter]\nFDR had to sell our country on this war and I believe he had to sacrifice Pearl Harbor and the lives that I Know it's a terrible thing to say but I uh I think that's that's how it happened\nIn order to galvanize public support\nRight yeah 'cause he he had already been saying this was Europe's war this is Europe's were well between the the ... the global economy which is not doing anything and the necessary time to get into the war coming through our spies and it was he knew it was time to break gut wrenching decision very gut wrenching decision\nSo that that's a that's how that came in to pass you know now that before we get\nIsn't this stuff and there's a lot of on accountability and whatever but the people that are out there trying to do the job on the day to day are patriots and they are people that are sacrificing a tremendous amount for the rest of us and I have a lot of respect for people that are that serve\nBut all that said there are implications to a democracy when the only people\nThat the citizenry has faith in our essentially the police forces which is the military as well as law enforcement\nAnd I made the point that that just becomes a very difficult situation for us to have again a functioning democracy\nAnd we have to at some level have some faith in our system or our system is going to have to make some radical changes well what we're seeing is some of those radical changes coming about if we look at what's happening with Brett Kavanaugh where do you think he's innocent guilty whatever totally beside the point but\nWhat you're seeing is the total manifestation of blood sport and yes politics is a blood sport as they used to say it's not being bag but this is I think a very different level than what we've seen previously and I don't know why any person would want to put themselves and their families through this\nI don't know I mean there's just no positions in court or anything else but I think there's going to be worth it for the vast majority of people and that means we are now going to be given a self selected group of essentially sociopaths and nurses is\nNow as we've kind of had that for a while but it just is going to get significantly worse and what it means is because there is so much value in power and we've all so talked about this a lot\nNo one's going to be willing to give up this power when you have a few thousand people deciding how to split up three and a half four trillion dollars of government spending who gets to write the rules and regulations for everybody else\nThat's a tremendous amount of power and these people become phenomenally wealthy there's actually a website called open secret start uh I think it's out of work\nAnd if you go there and what you can find out is the net worth essentially if every person in Congress and you can actually track it over time and I haven't looked in a couple of years\nBut I remember being very stunned that if you look at the percentage of Congress people who essentially at least doubled their net worth while they were in Congress it was well over a third of the people\nAnd the people that had doubled their net worth\nAnd I'm not going to get the number is exactly right but this will be closed they they went from that you know worth of about one point seven million dollars to something around seven million okay then that was kind of what the average person that had doubled their wealth while they were in Congress had done and this isn't just an aggregate number of people that get skewed by a few folks\nThis was actually looking at individuals\nThey are also some individuals in Congress to claim that they actually had negative net worth\nI'm which I'm not sure I really want those people making financial decisions for me but be that all is it may\nHere was the point if these people make a hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars a year sensibly and yet they're becoming phenomenally wealthy I mean do you ask questions like how to Dennis Hastert go from being a high school wrestling coach to being worth ten million dollars when he walked out of Congress\nYou'll Nancy Pelosi has ... this is a bipartisan thing okay hazards Republican blows who's a Democrat\nAnd you know she's made phenomenal amounts of money because of how transportation projects have been routed through her area and places where she's owned property and there's a ton of stuff like this Harry Reid's made a boatload of money on real estate by buying stuff and then the other government projects in the area\nThe point I Want to make is this these people are totally divorced from the average person these people don't I don't think give a hoot about anybody but themselves in the vast majority of cases I understand there are exceptions there\nAre people who are trying to do the right thing but\nWith all due respect to be trying to do the right thing I don't know why you're running for these offices because it should be apparent to anyone who's in these offices that has become a sense the impossible to do the right thing\nNow what does this have to do with the market what I'm seeing coming in and again I don't know who's gonna win the elections in two thousand and Eighteen I'm not saying who should win or who I'm favoring\nBut if the Democrats win the house and a lot of people think they will\nThat that have tremendous implications to the downside for the stock market you know people talk about well you only have a divided government it tends to be good for the markets well not when the one branch of the government is spending all of his time investigating the other branch which is what's going to happen you will effectively ... two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd if you look it was driven this market hire\nThe market first of all after inflation didn't really go much of anywhere from the year two thousand two the year two thousand and sixteen\nStarting with the election until now now there are some tremendous gains in the market although it's still only give you about four percent a year and kind of capital gain not again that's not even factoring in inflation so still hasn't been great but it's gotten somewhat better\nPart of the reason is is there's this belief that taxes will continue to come down that regulation will be more under control and if we spent two years investigating and the most ruthless manner possible which is what I see coming investigating the president I'm not sure that's going to be good for markets\nThe question is what do we do about it\nNow I'm going to talk about a number of other factors that are out there but there's a lot of things that are kind of screaming that we're really close to a top in this market so the class it on to be teaching is\nBefore the crash it's going to be strategies both to the market ... to go up as well as protection strategies and very importantly strategies for making money when the market goes down if you want to come to

T. A. as in online trading academy two\nThree one nine nine that when we come back from break we're going to talk about some things that indicate that we might be getting pretty close to a top of the market and one of the some of the stuff you really should be watching out for that again you can then figure out how to protect yourself and make money to downsize CNN [noise]\n\nHi this is Ken from online training academy Phoenix in this series of spots I'm going to debunk some common myth about the market myth too\n[noise] [noise]\nHi Jenna welcome back to the next week and socks and the black helicopters and CNBC there's next week and next week to ... buy online trading academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years since the world's most trusted name in professional trader education\nAll right real quick before I get to the signs that we might be nearing the top in the market I just want to finish the kind of one thought from the last segment\nI was talking about kind of in my opinion the futility of technical analysis now understand this is someone that being me\nWho when I was learning to trade years ago went to pretty much every hotel seminar there was out there who spent and I kid you not tens and tens of thousands of dollars learning about technical analysis buying software I studied the ... waving the Fibonacci and all that stuff and I kid you not\nI can talk that as well as anybody\nAnd here's what you find out when you really get into it is that it has no real predictive value\nAnd if it doesn't really have any predict you let me let me save you tens of thousands of course here okay there's no point in spending the time and money learning something that fundamentally doesn't work\nAnd again I Would get back to if this really work why are there are hundreds of different technical indicators why they're literally an infinite number of adjustable parameters well it's because after the fact that it's really easy to say well that would have worked\nBut again unless you make enough money in the markets to buy a time machine I'm not sure that's really all that valuable\nThe next big approach that people take and I spend some money on this as well as what's called fundamental analysis\nReally studying these companies and understanding what they do and all the rest of it well the problem is first of all that relies on you knowing things other people don't know and the first question is what are you going to know the Goldman Sachs doesn't already know\nThe second thing is is that a lot of what we're told it's not that we just don't even know stuff what we know it was wrong I Would actually argue on most of these companies we have negative information because most of what we're told isn't for our benefit in fact none of it's for our benefit\nI mean think about this the market is is zero sum game and this is something I cover in class at sometimes controversial but I Will prove it to the market is\nA zero sum game now if the market is a zero sum game than Goldman Sachs and these guys make boatloads of money which I Will show to you in class as well somebody's losing boatloads of money and over time it becomes the retail trader\nAnd it's because they're acting on bad information and they're not ever understanding that well they might be wrong sometimes\nAnd the key to this whole thing is whenever you get into you know what do you want to call investment a trade or whatever\nThe first question to always ask is\nHow bad could this be and can I live with that because of the answered that has no it doesn't matter how good it could be all that matters is can you deal with that loss and by the way the amount of money you should be willing to lose in any given investment shouldn't be any more than kind of one percent of your account because you're going to have\nLosers and you'd have losers in a row it's just the way the math works you may have six eight ten losers in a row even have happier trades make money\nAnd you can make a lot of money if happier trades make money okay but most people can't make money even if sixty or Seventy percent of their trades make money because on the trades were they lose they lose a lot and that's the thing we have to really avoid and again this is the kind of stuff I'm going to cover in class and and just real quick for the those views tuning in\nWhen I look at this market I see a lot of dangers in this market in the first segment I kind of talked about I think the election this fall could be really pivotal for this market\nI don't have a dog in the fight I don't you know I can make money up or down it makes no difference to me but I think that if you have Democrats control of Congress after the fall and you may think this is the greatest thing in the world and that's not my argument my argument is I think there's going to have a tremendous impact on the markets and can be exceptionally negative\nBecause what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through a Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings and it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will\nIt is not going to inspire confidence market's dropped thrive on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the market\nWe have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly so that the class I'm going to be teaching and and by the way it totally aside from that\nThere's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nAnd I'm really getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes\nBut the to me the key is\nYou have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad as it happens way too fast and you can't react in time you've got to be positioned before it happens now when the markets fall as I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the U.S and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in the year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to his two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years\nAnd people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investing horizon is thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard than for people who achieved their goals\nSo going to be talking about how do we identify the prices at was big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at\nYou know when he was buying apple at a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was by an apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money when this stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is is they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have losses okay if you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected\nI think most people would not okay and that's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a marketing a RINO manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at at charts and looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere's a fundamental we'd better approach again that I Wanna teach in class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T.
