[noise]\nMister rich vote tally now stands at third round the thirty five it will take a simple majority for confirmation of bread around [noise]\nWhich are Rubio\n[noise] I'm not sure John decker if you've heard the interview with Mitch McConnell on a Fox News channel a little bit before the Senate but he suggested that he and the president had talked an awful lot after that second hearing and never wavered\nOn on their ... um supportive of Brett Kavanaugh um it was no talk between him and the president he set of of pulling the nomination I assume that's pretty consistent with your reporting with how the White House has handled this show very unique nomination nominee\nWell that's right the White House digging in its heals over Brett Kavanaugh over the course of the past if you got even\nA one at times over the course of the past few will his nomination was in doubt I was outside during ... for the president's departure when that interview was played on Fox News channel but you may know\nThat Senator McConnell gave an interview as well to the Washington Post I read that interview and in that interview he again reiterated that at no time were you doubt that they would stick with Brett Kavanaugh has their nominee van\nHollen [noise]\nChris Van Hollen of Maryland a casting his votes is Warren [noise]\nWhat's up as Warren of Massachusetts the White House prices are no votes um we're waiting for for the wicker\nNumber here to to reach majority simple ... with Ninety nine senators voting as we expect with her youngest the Kavanaugh sitting at forty nine right now [noise]\nVice president presiding over the United States Senate\n[noise]\nAnd that should be my vote\nFrom Montana [noise]\n... ... or gambling al ... [noise] he where ... [noise]\nWe didn't do it I\nI had voted no hair will not change the outcome\nI dare for withdrawing I thought the senator has that right\n[noise]\nSenators voting in the permitted Alexander ...\nThrough the tally you average the explanation iron from la Murkowski or a Republican from Alaska explaining that if the ... Republican from Montana where president he would have voted yet\nAnd already granted opposed they would vote no\nBut you allow Hitler or his vote to count high without him being here because it does not count as he is voting present and made that announcement and you heard the virus in and say the senator has that right that is something that does not happen very often in the United States Senate marine used to be a traditional it's more frequently than it is\nA recently called airing\nA vote I Believe the last time it happened was was ... fourteen and it is a ... when you have sometimes have the same party sometime to different parties that are on two different in the wake of the vote and\nFor one reason or another Senate or can't be there and and they find a partner to to pair with two are not change the outcome in any meaningful way and that is what we just saw him as you made the earlier point John\nUm it is a sense of of comedy a sense of unity that is the explanation that land Murkowski gave last night when explained that she was going to do this threat Ryan\nAt least bit by bit or store um some of the the the ... nature of the United States Senate has really been tested over the last few weeks of his nomination Gillibrand well keep in mind that\nLeaves you'll nature maybe back to where it needs to be on the Republican Ron died I don't think it is certainly there between the parties are because of what has happened over the past few weeks it's going to take our time\nA Senator Flake is an open about that he wants to do something up to ... that ... of bringing I guess you could call it a more Schumer a camaraderie or within the Senate\nCertainly it's not at the place where Senator Flake who spoke about this on the Senate floor and also during war now that Judiciary Committee hearing White House wanted to be\nA that something it's going to take\nAs I said you're a quite some time especially when you consider the mid term elections upon us for weeks I Believe from today\nAnd so the partisanship only going to increase in the weeks to come\nAs it stands right now with no senators change their vote we believe that vote tally is fifty to forty eight fifty yes votes to forty eight no votes that would come from\nOnce this vote is official Brett Kavanaugh as an associate justice Sunday United States Supreme Court senator Danes Republican from Montana not voting is he attends his daughter's wedding Senator Murkowski explaining\nHer reason for voting present because of ... so they are still working through the vote tallies making everything official um before this vote is called but as we expected\nA the votes appear to be there for Brett Kavanaugh that upcoming associate justice on the United States Supreme court but John there's a a little bit of formality of a little bit of paperwork a few other things that have to be done before\nA Brett Kavanaugh will be addressed as Mr justice right\nWell that's right he of course still needs to take the oath he needs to get sworn in the White House indicating that could happen as early as this Monday I'll bet that is a federal holiday so perhaps we're taking a Tuesday when he's sworn in and of course you know this already cheered the Supreme Court\nA session this term the Supreme Court has already gone began the first Monday in October of this past Monday so a judge soon to be called justice Kevin all will have missed much when he finally takes his place as the ninth justice on the U.S Supreme Court\nProbably will be able to catch up and it's too old so I think that Supreme Court justices have to take not just the one that you are\nCorrect that is correct and so uh we'll see a public oath that uh uh\nBrett Kavanaugh will take that will likely be here at the White House if they follow the same form and function that we saw with Neil Gorsuch last year when he took his place and of course there was a big ceremony and the rose garden here at the White House when that took place I Would imagine we'll see the same thing take place for Brett Kavanaugh\nLooks like many of the Republican senators have started to walk around shaking hands I see Bob Corker the retiring senator from Tennessee shaking hands with majority leader\nMitch McConnell who is um had a pretty broad smile for most of the day is you can imagine getting this confirmation through it has not been the easiest road we're waiting for that vote total to be announced by the vice president who's presiding over the Senate Mike Pence\nLooks like he's got the gamble in hand which usually is indicative of an announcement about to be made by the presiding officer\nUm other senators now now moving about as well as this vote is about to become official fifty yes votes forty eight votes confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court [noise]\nAnd we continue to wait ... sometimes ... there is a little bit of of um formality and procedures that takes place with the Senate votes particularly on these\nAre very important ones you want to make sure every senator has just been counted everything's been counted the correct way before you\nYou drop that gamble but this was an outcome that was expected after those procedural votes yesterday in the announcements that came following from US Senators are Collins and mansion and\nFlake um the loan a Republican no votes are coming from Lisa Murkowski who is changing her vote to present your current events do senator tanks [noise]\nCarper\nSounds like they are working their way through I was a senators are beginning to leave the floor so that would be an indication John that uh they believe their their work here is finished um regardless of of the outcome that they favored are opposed um it has been interesting to\nWatch Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Senator or the one Republican opposed the Kavanaugh a sitting at her desk watching all of this continuing to speak with colleagues are shaking hands with it looks like a West Virginia a Republican Shelley Moore capital or\nA Supreme Court justice who she felt would be hostile to roe v Wade and she announced her support for Brett Kavanaugh yesterday that vote was considered key to his ultimate confirmation here's a little bit\nOf how Susan Collins explained how she got to her position of yes uh yesterday on the Senate floor\nDebate it's complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process it's not a try\n[noise] but if I'm getting\nNano legal print a bad deal threat that\nThe print them send in and and their\nGuilt there on my thinking and I can not a band and that\n[noise]\nThat was Maine Republican Susan Collins talking about the sexual misconduct allegations that have\nBeen leveled against Brett Kavanaugh he has a very defiantly a defended his name and said that those are unequivocally not true uh brought out a second hearing a in front of the Judiciary Committee with him and\nUh a woman who made that accusation Christine Blasey Ford 'em and ultimately you heard that they're having a big impact on on the ultimate decision of of of\nAh the Susan Collins the Republican from Maine now one of the other undecided up until yesterday was another a moderate Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski or the one Republican who ended up uh stating a negative position on confirmation and here's her explanation\nI Believe they have a nice good man\nClearly a learning channel [noise]\nLike [noise] my conscience [noise]\nWhy don't I have kids all day with my conscience [noise]\nI could not concluded that he is the right person for the court time\nBack [noise]\nThat was the only nation of a Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and again the one Republican who would have voted no she ended up changing that both the president to a pair it with Steve Gaines Montana Republican who wasn't here but the outcome remains the same Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the United States Supreme court by a vote of fifty\nTo forty eight is one of the narrowest votes ever for a Supreme Court nominee though we expected that to be the case that vote interrupted at times from\nProtest a shouting from the gallery but\nUh at the end of the day the Brett Kavanaugh will join this United States Supreme Court or you want to talk about close divisions in the United States Senate we've seen in recent opinions John ... a pretty closely divided Supreme Court as well but a dead or soon to be justice Kevin ... will become a member of\nWell that's right over the course of the past few years we've seen quite a few five to four decisions by the U.S Supreme Court a largely breaking down along ideological lines of the swing vote over the course of the past I Would say\nAlmost two decades has been Justice Kennedy who's a place on the court of justice soon to be justice capital of will take the place of and uh it's thought that Kavanaugh will be a more solid conservative vote and so perhaps we will see that swing vote emerge\nA said during his tenure on the Supreme Court which could be for the next few decades given how young he is\nAnd we talked about this during the confirmation process uh justices are difficult to predict sometimes you don't always know exactly how they will rule on on issues that we may not even be able to imagine a a pure before them\nWell that's right now just just a soon to be justice cabin on al judge Kavanaugh he sits on the U.S circuit court of appeals for the DC circuit or he was asked quite a bit during his confirmation\nProcess how he would vote on numerous controversial items that may come up before the Supreme Court he refrain from answering those questions but he'll certainly be tested a and it will be interesting to watch his first year on the Supreme Court he will be confirmed as a force as early as this Monday\nBrett Kavanaugh confirmed that the United States Supreme court by a fifty to forty eight votes in the United States Senate a second nominee for President Trump and the highest court in a land for John decker I'm Jared ... the U.S Capitol this is Fox News radio [noise]\n[noise]\nHi this is kind of welcome back the next week and stocks in the black helicopters and CNBC there's next week and soccer next week and stocks has brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional\nTrader education All right this week I Want to get into some signs I see of the top in the market but in the first segment just to recap briefly\nI look at the sheer vitriol and hatred on both sides\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which sign to that argument Iran first of all if you believe firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay\nAnd you can say well then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut realize the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned I have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through a whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment therefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of this class\nIs and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this\nBecause you're gonna have losers and have losers in a row is just the way the math works you may have six eight ten losers in a row even have happier trades make money\nAnd you can make a lot of money if happier trades make money okay but most people can't make money even if sixty or Seventy percent of their trades make money because on the trades were they lose they lose a lot\nAnd that's the thing we have to really avoid and again this is a kind of stuff I'm going to cover in class and and just real quick for the those views tuning in\nWhen I look at this market I see a lot of dangers in this market in the first segment I kind of talked about I think the election this fall could be really pivotal for this market\nI don't have a dog in the fight I don't you know I can make money up or down it makes no difference to me but I think that if you have Democrats control of Congress after the fall and you may think this is the greatest thing in the world and that's not my argument\nMy argument is I think there's going to have a tremendous impact on the markets and can be exceptionally negative\nBecause what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through a Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings and it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will\nIt it is not going to inspire confidence market's dropped thrive on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the market\nWe have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly so that the class I'm going to be teaching and and by the way it totally aside from that there's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nAnd I'm really getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes\nBut the to me the key\nIs you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad as it happens way too fast and you can't react and time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the U.S and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in the year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to his two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years\nAnd people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investing horizon is thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make\nMoney to the downside that's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you big institutions like Goldman Sachs where people like Warren Buffett are buying yet\nYou know when he was buying apple at a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was by an apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money when this stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is is they invest in stocks cause they think they're safe socks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have losses okay\nIf you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay and my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a market you know manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you can always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at at charts and looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere's a fundamental we better approach again that I was teaching class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T.
