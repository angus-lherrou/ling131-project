inspected which was the numbers eleven and twelve one of them found in a in a male facility in Florida and we don't know ... or the other ones were not yet at least I haven't heard that yet but it isn't a male facility and Florida addressed to Cory Booker\nThere's a senator from New Jersey another in a male facility in New York City address to former intelligence director James Clapper if this fits the mold than those would be numbers eleven and twelve will keep you updated all morning on that\nThe election who's going to win the election what does it come down to is it turn out yes it always is turnout it's going to be who's ... base is motivated and who can win over the independent voters\nUm and ah\nWe're looking at the packages or it looks like one addressed a James Clapper by the way and it looks to be identical to the other one said manila envelopes same return address same ... same font same everything forward is misspelled yeah Florida's misspelled\nI'm\nSo we'll keep you updated they're not showing a picture of that package on on television so it looks as at least the one to James Clapper that they found in New York\nIs one to match everything else is doing nothing I'm stamps but I think it's probably on the other side wherever it was post marks as I Do know that there was postage markings on it to show where he came from ... but you're right when you look at the front of it like that there's nothing that's that ... that void the stamps that that's normally that when they put on I get a\nPackage every day because I collect sports cars and by the mind on the Internet there it's over the stamp every single time yeah so interesting\nIt is yeah\nSo where are they and maybe how it was shipped I don't know I don't know was it shipped inside of something else I don't know you know was it a package in a package\nAnd wife with stamps on it yeah I don't know it's very odd\nSo that now we have that would verify so far what we're seeing Clapper

his ass kicked or something to that effect um and you know I have always thought the civility was always better\nWhen it comes to public discourse I Would rather have a heated but civil conversation with somebody I disagree with but you can't blame violence or an act like this on rhetoric\nIt's you can't you change everything when you do you know you can't I it was absurd that James I'm Sorry James that Charles Manson and said he was hearing\nLyrics and hearing messages and the lyrics of the ... album by the Beatles\nIt was absurd to think that you could blame the Beatles or their music for it it was also absurd that you could blame Marilyn Manson for the cause of Columbine or violent video games for causing people to do anything\nI think I don't play video games the violent games 'cause they're so realistic in graphic I don't want to see it but millions and millions and millions of people disagree with me of all ages from grandfather's two grand children they could barely hold the controllers in their hands and they don't grow up to be violent people\nSo you got to blame the source\nIt wasn't politically motivated in Tucson with Gabrielle Giffords it was a mentally deranged person that committed this act\nJames Holmes in Colorado all of these other ones that we know these are deranged people it's not political motivation what it does is it serves your political purpose

P. S. director and I do believe that the D. P. S. director is the right person for the job he is a good man you've been in law enforcement for over Thirty years or he is the heat is a servant leader\nUm and I mean that he is he's kind of a cops cop to begin with but he has a servant leader he he he serves by leading or leads by serving I should say\nAnd uh I just I think the world of him but imagine a different governor David Garcia that means Frank Mills says probably out of a job and you're going to get a deep yes director that thinks negatively about law enforcement and a lot of ways which sounds odd but listen to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum is talking about law enforcement and the use of force\nBy police now for police accountability for law enforcement society cannot work quite frankly enforcement and John [noise]\nIf it got a heavy truck in relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to have gone to all the time to a taser and they have already have to go too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they are a fire in community in in society supposed to be able to bring most situations he'll\nFirst of all they do\nIt's not like television we're a cop runs out of the car shoots three or four people get back in the car runs down the street shoots another three or four people runs down the street and arrest somebody and saves a woman from jumping off a building\nIt doesn't work that way Ninety nine percent of police work does not involve violence or physical confrontations first of all so this guy's a fool but secondly when they say when people on the left say trust in the community\nThey mean criminals that's what they mean because the community by and large trust the police\nThe outpouring of support for the police across this country is immense when an officer was injured or killed\nThe police especially here in the valley the different agencies from Phoenix pd which I Know probably the very best to all the way out to the east and west valley is where I'm not as familiar with some of the people that work there\n[noise] um [noise]\nOh we just got breaking news that you were going to have an attorney break into this because law enforcement the federal government the feds have just arrested a man in connection with the suspected explosives\nSources are saying that they have now this is CNN reporting\nThat they have a boat rested someone so Rob ... is getting ready to bring you the news here at eight o'clock so we're going to have a full update and was soon as we get an identity if this was even true because right now I'm the only agency we're seeing reporting it is CNN but we'll be looking into more of this\nSo uh that's great news if they've already arrested somebody in connection with these are suspected of explosives [noise] alright your chance coming up\nYou could win a thousand dollars by text keyword at eight oh two brought you buy a and E. auto glass just after eight o'clock will bring you more on this story the arrest was made in a Fox News reporter joins us to talk about this situation stick around [noise]\n\nIn Iraq has been made good\nI'm not much of one man now in police custody in connection with twelve suspicious packages mailed\nTo several politicians and Democrats supporters\nDon't know much more beyond that but CNN saying there was a clue and all of the packages in some mistakes were made by the builder of these pipe bombs this is brand new informations that he's a preliminary details but the FBI has made in the rest in connection\nWith these packages keyword there being a rest they're not holding someone as a person of interest so as we learn more information we will share it with you this has to more suspicious packages had been found this morning one dress to New Jersey Democrat Senator Cory Booker the other was in New York City Fox News's Brian units there in Manhattan is\nSuspicious package from our sources was addressed to deny\nJames Clapper we also know from postal workers that the package\nLooked exactly like it resembled those packages that we have seen throughout the week the manila envelope the sticks excessive postage stamps with the American flag on them the block lettering this particular post office in the middle of midtown New York is just seven blocks south of the time Warner center were that initial package\nWas sent over to the time Warner building\nThis package been moved outside by the NYPD it's gonna be damning now for more forensic evidence President Trump taking your Twitter just you moments ago writing Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics\nVery unfortunate what is going on Republicans go out and vote is that we finished that troop meanwhile the president could be sending US Army troops to the U.S Mexico border showed\nPlanning on sending about eight hundred help with logistics you order for that could be signed as early as today I was on the cars made a big thing that just\nDoesn't seem to be organic and nature doesn't seem to be Mr law abiding because many of these ... which are two countries where they get sick asylum and refugee for them\nCNN for in order for the ... former of intel director Clapper the other they found in Florida ... earn that that sorting facility that was addressed the Cory Booker the senator from New Jersey\nSo right now there's a man in South Florida in connection with suspicious packages ... say that again Andrew plantation for okay at plantation I Know yeah I'm\nFamiliar with that area south the very very deep south east Florida is where plantation is you'd be down in the Miami Fort Lauderdale area that's what you're talking in that part of the state plantation is more of a\nKind of a suburb um\nIs plantation where Fort Lauderdale Miami or bigger cities ... plantation Florida very nice suburb of Florida but way southeast in you know if you're looking at if you're looking at a map it's very far southeast Florida\nAnd so this is a compelling in my friends in in the investigative world it's like they had they see signs based on things when they narrow it down to a state when you start hearing that\nUm that\nThey've narrowed it down to a state then he said they've got a suspect in mind it's funny they're showing 'em footage on television right now will flatbed tow truck which authorities are going to be telling the vehicle of what they believe I imagine what they believe the suspect\nAnd um if that's what they're doing um we're gonna know who this guy is pretty quickly because I'm\nA ... the license plate number I'm sure they're gonna get we're going to get names here pretty quick\nSo this is a the story of the week and congratulations to federal authorities for making this arrest 'em and doing it as quickly as they did because this is pretty amazing stuff to have gotten this guy this quickly I'm not usually they're showing his van on TV and it's covered in bumper stickers\nIf that's the yeah that's the guy's band so uh obviously someone that is he's got to kind of a white panel that looks kind of like the mystery mobile but it's white\nAnd they're going to be telling his vehicle from that site so I imagine it's not going to be long um they've got it looks like they have the license plate covered so people can't very readily find out who he is but I imagine we'll be getting answers on that quickly so they've made it a rest plantation Florida very far southeast Florida the feds will be briefing on this arrest coming up at about\nEleven thirty our time are\nEleven thirty our time there will be doing a briefing on this but I imagine by then the media is going to have a lot more information on who

reporter on everything she has on this coming up at eight thirty five\nYou know rain forest plumbing and has been in business in Arizona for quite a while and it's a company that I admire\nUm it is a

referrals\nThey want to make sure they're doing a good enough job that their customers become advocates for them I Am one of those customers that's an advocate they do great work they show up on time they fairly priced and they make sure that you're an informed consumer you feel good when they're with you\nYou know sometimes people are concerned until you're comfortable with someone you want to make sure you're getting a fair price for the work that needs to be done\nThey will tell you what needs to be done and what it's going to cost before they do any work they put that in writing they

big morning fast moving morning federal authorities making arrest in South Florida plantation aventura Florida down by Hollywood near that part of the state joining us now Fox News radio reporters original settling Rachel what's the latest you're hearing on this arrest\nHey good morning yeah they picked up and then described it in his fifties he's a former New Yorker most recently living in in Florida with most notable about the fact is that he is known to law enforcement he'd been arrested for a for terroristic threat that according to officials haven't spoken to Fox News\nI end the threats comes after the FBI I went through this nail sorting facility which I'm sure you're seeing pictures of outside nanny and and that's where several of these packages pass through agents were reviewing surveillance footage taken a friend that facility\nA and also a from local businesses nearby so one would you know kind of a bird we don't know for sure that they are maybe identify someone on camera\nOr maybe them and I thought something and they looked at the kind of hauling away or a white van is covered with a blue tarp may be the vehicle\nThat stuff that was driving but officials are still cautioning it just because they pick up the stuff that doesn't mean that there's not some more packages out there but at least interested then made\nYeah that was the question we had was how quickly will this person either admit to this to be is going to talk at all if there are more packages will be identified and we were watching 'em as they were showing the van\nThat it is covered in it looks to be political bumper stickers and saw the authorities covered that vantage ... we think to cover up those bumper stickers for whatever reason now from your experience we're hearing so much about this suspect\nHow long before you believe the media will have him identify generally it's you they they get an idea who this person is and then we can start tracking who using his history\nNot long uh the Justice Department's going to hold a news conference here in about three hours to thirty eastern\nOr they're going to hold a news conference I don't know if they'll identify him at that time they may\nOr so and they'll probably caution that there could be some more devices still out and that there needs to be an awareness to us throughout the postal system that they're still could beat them out there and in the coming days there'll be a discussion\nIrfan on before Riggs road mark house or west side\nThose people got a couple of problems first of all a brand has reopened at

there are other packages out there that had been mailed or if there are more packages that were manufactured that are somewhere waiting to go that they've got to go into fuses well\nI mean there's
