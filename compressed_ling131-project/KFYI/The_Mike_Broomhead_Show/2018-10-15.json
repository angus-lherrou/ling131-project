interesting\nBloomberg looked into the twenty sixteen individual return data\nIn detail and here's some in ... insights and it was pretty amazing\nFor the class warfare fighters out there I Want you to have some information when you talk to people about class warfare because at our hearts most people have a distrust for the government it's just a weird that Democrats whether they mean to or not are giving the government more power by taking more of the citizens money\nYou could weaken the government and its ability to do the things you don't want it to do\nBy not giving it as much of your money but you continue to vote for people that want to raise taxes Bernie Sanders is number two on the list for down right now in polling for democratic nominee for president in twenty twenty\nHe's a socialist so how's this for some statistics the top one percent of a wage earners in the U.S [noise]\nPaid thirty three point seven percent of income taxes that's more than the bottom Ninety percent combined they paid thirty point five percent so the top one percent pay more than the bottom Ninety percent income taxes combined\nThe top fifty percent of wage earners in this country\nPaid Ninety seven percent of income taxes that is insane it is impossible\nFor you to tax the wealthiest in this country enough to offset our deficit it's impossible you want to say Medicare you want to save 'em Social Security is going to be impossible to do that by taxing the wealthy even if you got the wealthy to go along with it\nWhich you won't\nYou will stagnate the economy you will shrink the economy\nEven if you do that\nYou are going to not come close to offsetting our deficits\nAnd when you've got the top fifty percent paying Ninety seven percent the class warfare should be going in the other direction\nThe class warfare should be from the upper fifty percent say what's going on why are we paying for everything\n\nThe bottom fifty percent pay three percent of the income taxes which is small percentile taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's the point zero zero zero one percent about fourteen hundred taxpayers that group alone paid three point two five percent of all income taxes in two thousand one the bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent\nWhereas the top zero zero one percent pay to point three percent so in other words Democrats in office Republicans in office it didn't matter the rich continue to pay more\nAnd more and more in percentage not just in dollar amount\n\nThey said the individual income tax system is designed to be progressive those with higher incomes pay higher rates while the Indian nation or the reduction in the ... progress\nFrom ... progressive witty\nCurve is visibly at the highest levels the more you pay the ... I mean the more you make the more you pay no one in and no one believes that's fair at any level\nIn any other aspect of our lives the sales tax is in our country are the same for everybody\nSo if I go out and buy a brand new vehicle like I just did\nI pay much higher taxes because it costs more money for that vehicle than you paying the same rate if you buy used car that's a few years older\nBut that's not fair right no that's the only thing that is fair we should all pay what we do every one\nIt's never going to happen because you'll never get politicians to say it out loud but what you are doing now is choking out people\nThat have wealth\nAnd it's it's just not the right thing to do and we're never going to offset our deficits with class warfare the American people have a spending problem at our government how we get out of that is ... is a completely different thing coming\nUp just after eight o'clock President Trump on sixty minutes what he had to say about the border issue in separating families at you argue with ... at least all about that and what he said about Russia all that just after eight o'clock you can win a thousand bucks here in just a moment\nWhile you got to do was texting and win thanks to eighty ought to last for sponsoring that event stick around you may win a thousand bucks [noise]\n\nPresident Trump is feeling sad good morning live from gave why newsroom on Mike Russell President Trump is feeling sad about Sears speaking of the White House\nToday Trump said the Sears was really big deal when he was growing up Sears is finally for chapter ... bankruptcy protections as it tries to survive and increasingly tough brick and mortar refill environment Trump said fears has been quote improperly run\nFor many years Senator Elizabeth Warren has released a DNA test from Boston Globe that to the Boston Globe says of papers say they provide strong evidence of or Native American ancestry\nThe possible democratic presidential contender for twenty twenty has been repeatedly\nMocked by Donald Trump and other Republicans over her ancestral claims President Trump title in her as Pocahontas on many occasions the analysis of orange DNA was reportedly done by Carlos de bustamante Stanford University professor in shows that she had a Native American and our family tree dating back six to ten generations by power NBC News radio\nThose six to ten generations have dated the ancestor back to the late Seventeen hundreds of former Phoenix mirrors okay after being robbed by a man with a hatch\nGreg Stanton says he was walking out of a Thai restaurant over the weekend when a guy in his late thirties with a chunky build walked up to him wielding the weapon there are reports that faced in through his wallet the guy and then ran back into the restaurant for help as demand vanished state and released a statement saying he'll eat at the place again Phoenix police are now in the hunt Jason ...

and be a part of the blue ways\nShe said it and she's a gubernatorial candidate\nSo that's the difference right now and what's happening why is President Trump saying China is well why is Lesley Stahl only talking about Russia why is anybody in the media talking about Russia because they believe the ... in the Carter page nonsense\nThat's why\n\nSo let's go back to Thirteen this was one of the parts of the interview that I thought was most compelling about the president she asks him you'd never held a political posed before you never served in the military what is it about this job that

than the real estate guys in New York they make tough deals but it deals a deal\nAnd it's he's exactly right\nYou look at the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and the way it was handled by people on the left and then they come out and say it was the people on the right Diane Feinstein if she was concerned about it and it ... the common sense is just exactly that common sense\nIs Dianne Feinstein was really concerned about Brett Kavanaugh and the charges against him made by Dr Christine Blasey Ford she would have said something months before and handled it the right way in a closed door hearing and not made a mockery and made a made a complete\nUm spectacle of that whole situation that's what she did that was their tactics and have you noticed\nGone poof Christine Blasey Ford is gone Brett Kavanaugh not even a headline anymore they're moving on to something next they're moving onto the next crisis it was the hurricane and the president was with Kanye instead of talking about the hurricane well the president's going to see the hurricane damage today\nBut he's going to or going to assess the the FEMA help\nButton that that won't be covered that way either\nSo you know he goes
