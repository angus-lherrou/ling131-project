advertising plan they had an ad campaign that they were paying I think millions of dollars for to get people to get gift cards if they recycle\nSo if you recycled you've got gift cards and this was the incentive to Jack up the amount of recycling we do in the city of Phoenix well it was so horrible they had to scrap the advertising campaign not the entire you know green energy thing he was doing\nJust the ad campaign had to be scrapped it was so expensive and it didn't accomplish anything and that is something he was the leader on Greg Stanton was the leader all across the city on this

water heater is the only way to get an infinite endless hot water basically in hot water on demand imagined the six or seven or tenth person to take a shower in the morning to give you all the hot water they want no matter how much they wanted the\nBank was water heater is like having to do this latest poll Meg you'll be hot water rich for the rest of your life and that means that used to house inefficient energy costs and the water heater will become a brand new storage closet in your twenty first century stayed in the yard I sat down\nAnd paying less water heaters and how much longer warranties lives standard water heater is because well they're just better in St Louis water\nHeaters installed by this sunny plumbers your right now to me a plumber\nPolitics is more interesting than ever so stay informed all day long when you talk by fifty KFYI\nSo the Brett Kavanaugh hearings continue why are the why are they in public why weren't they behind closed doors that's the big question we've been asking a couple of things that if you want to talk to people in a rational way about this there's some things you need to know about FBI investigations these background checks that are done\nThere is a specific bureau or ... which is specific department of the bureau that does these background checks every single background check that comes across their desk for these nominees has a deadline they all have a stop date everyone\nSo for\nThe disingenuous members of the committee on the left to act as if a deadline and one of these investigations is unheard of uncalled for and somehow suspicious is part of the narrative and the lie they all know there's a deadline on every background check every single one anytime there was a red flag it's\nHandled in a closed door meeting and which behaviors are looked at because they look into your life and they go deep it's about the kind of person you were a what do they know about you um did you do drugs did you drink or those kinds of things\nAnd as Jon Kyl and I want you to hear Jon Kyl John ... talks about this process Jon Kyl says there is a mechanism within the committee that is well known to all committee members that whenever there was a red flag\nFor a candidate is handled in a closed door session and Jon Kyl laments the fact that this was done so publicly\nAnd we had many many many situations in which there were\nAllegations are made through FBI interviews about a potential judicial nominee\nThat needed to be further investigated and which are desirable to keep confidential most of the show to do with drug use of one kind or another and we always did that through a process was rolling on to all the members of the committee and never got in the newspaper sometimes the nominees withdrew their ... they were\nWithdrawn by the president sometimes with ready went ahead and voted sometimes up sometimes down but\nThere was a way to handle it and that would have been much preferable way to handle this for the sake of a professor foreigners as well as for a judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that process is not being used here so then the question I asked was why why would they make this so public why would they put this woman through the scrutiny and the death threats that she's received which were horrible why would they do this to this woman well the answer is they've got to win at all cost\nThat day of got to somehow exclude Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd it would've been anybody it would have been any candidate it happened to be Brett Kavanaugh they have got to destroy this person because they've got to delay this beyond the midterms their hope is to use this as a campaign\nTo say we've got to take the Senate because of we take the Senate he's never going to get a nominee past us never going to happen\nAnd so that's the only hope they have is to delay this vote either delayed the vote on Kavanaugh or get Kavanaugh out to put somebody else in and that would be after the midterms\nIt's a dangerous dangerous thing to do a breakers team um it is a dangerous thing to do\nSo Cory Booker is going to tell you what that is and this is what scares me Cory Booker is now going to tell you what the plan was\nWhen their credibility has been challenged Fife intimate people that knew the Kennedy well as a classmate [noise]\nTemperament has been revealed in an emotional moment [noise]\nWhere do you use language if that frankly shocked a lot of [noise] and then ultimately [noise] whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial to fall financially [noise] oh no question the way that we should not move on to another candidate [laughter]\n[noise] so then there's the plan\nIt's not about whether or not he did it it's not about guilt or innocence did we raise enough questions that we need to move on to a different candidate isn't that amazing because what was the reason they gave for this investigation why did\nThis investigation need to take place they said the investigation needed to take place to judge the merits of the allegations\nBy Dr Ford now Cory Booker is saying doesn't matter guilty or innocent what does that make you believe well two things number one they know what's coming in this report which is everything we already knew we already knew there is nothing new here there's nothing provable out these accusations", "show_name": "The Mike Broomhead Show",
