the grand scheme of the world it's it's obviously a very sad story but it's the way it's being covered by the American\nMedia a week ago a Saudi journalist walked into a consul general in in Istanbul intending to get paperwork that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiance she hasn't seen him since so he went into the consulate and then disappeared and of course it's a journalist\nThe Saudis are friends with the Americans and so the rumor mill is out there about somehow we need to do something about this at the end the grand scheme of what's going on in America and I'm not trying to make light of a human being missing or dying or anything else\nThis is not topic a necessarily\nBut what is incredible about this is the way the American media\nThe conjecture so the the pathway to get to what you're about to hear begins to and a half years ago\nIt begins to and a half years ago when Donald Trump was a candidate for president and and played the media like a fiddle\nYou know ... you know two and a half actually more than two and a half years or two and a half years ago I guess we'll be right about the time he began to really show people um what he was made up when it came to playing the media so Joe Scarborough and my barnacles we're talking about this\nAnd listen to the progression of thought as a matter of ... this was a real possibility in their mind\nThe largest question uh this race is\nThe ministry nation and Saudi Arabia the\n... restoration and re I hear that they were so comfortable in their relationship with Donald Trump\nFor the sake of getting a green light internally to do what they allegedly have done and get away with it without the United states and\nThe Pearl of march Jeffrey ... traffic\nWell we're looking pretty good a micro we've got a lot

he really wants you to pay attention to him he just want someone to talk to 'em\nSo we know that Michael ... has launched into Twitter tirades that had been what's funny about this is that when you're a when someone is better than us something you're able to do something and then the other person just kind of want up you on a whim it's it's hysterical\nAnd Michael ... is a novice when it comes to social media in comparison to just about anybody in the Trump family and he has gotten the these social media beat down by Donald Trump junior on a number of occasions\nSo Michael ... he took to Twitter uh yesterday I Believe\nUm yeah yesterday\nAnd I'm not to be\nNo just because no one's been paying attention to him you know the right cabinet thing is over so his candidate his client that says she was gang raped by Brett Kavanaugh has nowhere to go\nAnd cable news is turned on him 'cause they're blaming him for most of his Kavanaugh stuff\nSo I ... tweeted out the following this would

Garcia\nAnd it's interesting it's the opposite of what I'm telling you about all Halloran what are the reasons why Garcia is not doing well one of the reasons is directional difficulties he sprinted left in the primary\nIn a red state they acknowledge it at the very beginning of this thing we talked about this before the statements that David Garcia made in order to win that primary when he talked about no wallet southern Arizona disbanded the border strike force critical very critical of law enforcement and the trust inside the communities with law enforcement\nI'm winning in the abortion comment is really what sent people over the edge\nThat are a lot of very pro choice people in Arizona\nAnd that would vote for a Democrat but even pro choice people for the most part do not believe that a Thirteen year old girl should be able to get an abortion without parental consent but Garcia's set in a public forum during the primary he believes a Thirteen year old should because he was preaching to the choir in that room\nHe had a very small audience in that room\nAnd he knew that the people watching it with raw meat to them that he would rather not get booed by them and have people shocked all over the state of Arizona was an amateurish way to handle that question\nAnd then what he did it that town hall meeting\nHe blamed the person asking the question as a plant from the other side it doesn't matter who asked the question you're the one that answered it in a very horrible fashion how do you lay someone asked me a question in a town hall meeting incidentally they learned their lesson recently at a town hall meeting up in Kingman one of his thugs pushed a guy out of the room for videotaping\nAbout sixteen seconds video you can see him that happened one of the other reasons Garcia has been a train wreck is his Vega educational agenda the ... normally not\nHaving something super specific wouldn't be an issue except you've called yourself the education governor you've got Derek Harris and you've got Joe Thomas and read for ... and everybody else on your side you've said over and over again yeah I'm an educator I'm the education governor\nYou got NO PLAN for education it is zero\nIt's just that they're still there but it's the opposite of all Halloran in this Derek Harris's lose I'm Sorry I'm you've got David Garcia losing because he tells you who he is\nI just think that's fascinating that you're losing because you were telling people who you are\nSo we will talk about whether or not it it was brought up on a couple of different shows
