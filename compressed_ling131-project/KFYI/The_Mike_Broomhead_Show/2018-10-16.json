the show starts again brought you by the people at any auto glass well thank you to them for the sponsorship but stick around and you might be a thousand dollars richer this morning actually in about ten minutes\nI'm Talking about the debates Martha makes Sally here since cinema last night\nAnd the economy now um I have a friend who's very liberal and he calls me out about the deficit\nNow the liberals don't care about deficits when they're in charge but I don't blame them when the tables are turned\nBecause when the conservatives run as balancing the budget and less spending and then they don't come through it is a broken promise now there's a multitude of reasons why it's happening but it is happening we are still we are still spending more money than we're making\nNow my friend tried to tie the tax cuts to the increase in deficits\nThat's where he's wrong and that's where it cures and send them is wrong\nBecause we also have set record revenue into the treasury for the fiscal Europe twenty Eighteen the tax cuts have done exactly what the president the Republicans in Congress and what I have been saying about tax cuts they actually increase revenue\nAnd they increase revenue just like price cuts on goods on Black Friday increase revenue it's why they call it Black Friday retailers and manufacturers go into the black on Black Friday because of increased sales\nYou spread the tax base out you lower taxes more people spend more revenue collected that's how it works so I Want you to hear Martha mix Sally number sixteen Andrew Martha ...\nDefends the tax cuts and says that's not what the deficits come from\nThe woman got to do is address at the other spending a every family every small business has to step down and identify where are they can find ways to address cutting they're saying well we're seeing the economy is on fire right now\nWhere the un American Jobs that are coming home and weren't gonna keep it going because that's what America is all about\n[noise] so again she's a hundred percent right we have to address bending the human example I've always used unfortunately as Elton John\nElton John would anybody ever think he'd go broke or Michael Jackson well they both did they both are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and continuing with huge incomes because of their music catalog and yet they were able to spend more than they made\nElton John has been very honest about it he had to stop all the crazy spending get it in line and he's still a very very wealthy man\nBut he was able to spend more than he made which seems impossible to many of us but he was doing it\nSo I Want to hear scarce in cinema now talk about why she voted against the tax cuts\nBut more importantly for Arizona is in their everyday lives to the auto jeopardizes spending a lot of carrying Social Security and after that that was passed many of my colleagues have said\nWell hell access than we're just going to go back in ... Medicare and Social Security that's not right [laughter]\nWhere did you hear her say that was that in the ladies' room you overheard or run another stall telling somebody sued if we win the election we're going to cut Medicare\nBut didn't you also say Martha's colleagues not her specifically was she was talking about the Republicans but it's not her specifically no oh yeah yeah Martha's colleagues so yeah you're right she didn't accused Martha of saying it she over her colleagues whispering it\nIt's just laughable so ... says we have to raise taxes so that\nWhat revenue goes back down to where it was before to save Medicare\nIf there's more money in the treasury this year than last year in tax cuts are responsible for it all you want as liberals is more money into the treasury why are you so concerned about how it gets there what is this what is with this class warfare nonsense of yours\nYou gave billions of dollars to corporations know what they did was they took less it was the it was those corporations money to begin with\nA tax cut is not giving them anything it's taking less from them and it's taking less from corporations big and small and individuals rich and poor and causes them to spend more money in increase the width of our economy why is that\nBad [noise] it's the deficit spending that is bad [noise] coming up just after eight o'clock\nYou're going to
