obviously yesterday was hectic was what we heard was possible we'd heard about evacuations and then why one at the White House turned out not to be true Kamala Harris turned out not to be true but

sent out\nSo we're waiting for a waiting for Brian youngest to call us and we'll talk with him about about what's happening in New York City but the there's a it looks like the similarities in these packages or this six stamps all of them were the same stamps return address seemed to be Debbie Wasserman Schultz um office\nAnd then they were address individually or they spelled Florida wrong F. L. O. R. I. D. S. instead of a if you look on um\nIf you look on a on the keyboard the ashes right next to the ... so it looks more like a like a more of a a mistake than a misspelling by mistake rather than not knowing how to spell Florida but um there's a lot of similarities and then the construction of the devices or what is really going to be of interest\nUm bombers people that construct bombs\nUm have a signature of most cases there is a way to tell they do things in a unique way sometimes it's material they use sometimes the technique they use the detonator where they get them\nAre these common items that can be found anywhere is there anything unique they can latch onto\nThat's going to be the big question but of course I'm with the political rhetoric that's happening is one thing we're

well we'll get to it\nBefore we get there the elections are obviously less than two weeks away\n[noise] and it is a theme around the country this is how you can tell that the president and what he's doing is working\nFor most people in spite of what the media would say when you have Democrats are running on how much they support the president on the economy and now they're willing to work across the aisle when was the last time you saw political campaign from the Democrats where they want it to work with the opposition\nWe have not heard any of that but in places like Nevada here in Arizona whether it's gears in cinema or Greg Stanton you've got Democrats in very well crafted very protected very isolated campaigns\nTrying to portray themselves to something that their records show that they are not but you're not looking at record you're looking at an ad and you know if you're not listening to talk radio or watching the news very carefully it's easy to get caught up in what these ads are go oh they look reasonable I mean that's that's terrific you know they will find Jimmy\nI Wonder if they're alienating their base well here is here is I'm Jacky Rosen Andrew play number

this president is a sexist homophobic racist Xena phobic mental case\nUm\nMika Brzezinski has a last what's left of her mind there's no doubt Mika Brzezinski has lost her mind she talks about the president the twenty Fifth Amendment they ought to invoke that on there on the Morning Joe let's start with number time we've got a couple of things for me 'cause this is is incredible\nI Can't turn it around really quickly I thought that the election of a lifetime any doubt has been raping are lined up for the past twenty four hours about the anger at the\nFormer Democratic officials former presidents are and everybody who apparently it and go\nGet focused now her credit for gays or if they're alive for what they have the election of a lifetime what does it say at that point they want to attack the president ... that's ... Michael ...\nHere's what I think happened I think this is quid pro quo UC Jared Kushner took a list over to the Saudis\nAnd they murdered the Washington Post reporter\nAnd now to deflect from that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is having these bombs sent the Democrats for for the president so I think this is them when they said that they were working with the Saudis to do this this is what I think they meant I'm pretty sure\nThis is the pay back so the Trump Administration green lights a hit on a reporter that he doesn't like and then in return the Saudis will go and attack the Democrats including CNN who we all know the president calls fake news\nSo if you want to run a campaign Democrats get make your ads now on how the president's rhetoric is now endangering lives\nIn credible\nSo CNN headline national manhunt for serial bomber going after Trump's targets\n[laughter]\nYeah none of these people are and reviled or hated\nBefore Donald Trump pointed out what fools they were\nIt's it's this is an amazing time in American history I've ... I've never witnessed anything like this\nSo now Mika all of you we all know that when\nUm W. W. M. D. what would make her do is what we're all gonna wear bracelets because you've been wondering what you should do in light of what happened yesterday as as as a Republican as a conservative\nOr even as an independent voter out there that listens to talk radio [noise] if you've been wondering what it is you should do in light of what happened yesterday Mika this morning put out the call to action to all of us\nOur country is at risk plant that has had [noise] no wonder okay\nOkay I don't like a train ride it no longer okay say well I really support that if\n[laughter] know longer okay [laughter] [noise]\nNot answer a question for you not speak out\nNot OK anymore it was okay yesterday I I felt like it was okay the last you know the the people on the left have been telling me all along you know what might we understand that you don't like the tweets but you support Trump and that's okay they've been telling me that for months but no longer it's no longer okay\nIf somebody sent out nine or ten packages to different individuals and organizations and uh it's not okay anymore\nThis is all President Trump's fault but this is mind boggling and so the media is once again\nGoing to use a crisis like this and I will tell you that I don't I think this is the lowest of human behavior I Would be laughing the same way if if these devices were being sent to Republicans I'm a Trump family members\nI wouldn't be blaming the media I wouldn't be blaming their rhetoric not at all\nYou blame the individual that does the horrible things now when somebody starts cornering Mitch McConnell in a restaurant\nAnd we'll let you hear when we get it's seven twenty what the Democrat rhetoric has been\nSo was it the media's fault and was a Democrat rhetoric fault Wednesday's police in those Republicans got shot up on that baseball field whose fault was that it was the maniac gunman that took a rifle to a baseball practice and started shooting people that's whose fault it was\nWhen you look at these mass shooters it's their fault it's not the enter race fault it's it is the fault of the person to meeting the act\nThis is insanity to try to blame the president but they have no other hope in the media\nThey ... they can slow down this president's becoming more and more popular he's sitting at about forty seven percent now he's at the highest he's been since his presidency his his um his disapproval rating is lower than it's been at any time in his presidency they're seen things happening in a good way and they don't like it\nSo now the issue is\nWhat happens next well when these things happen blame him it's irresponsible but for the media to do it for Mika Brzezinski to flat out blame this president without having any knowledge of who did this what if it turns out to just be some apolitical maniac\nAnd what if it does turn out to be a Trump supporter wonder if it's some big guy sitting somewhere in a make America great\nAgain hat ... you're still going to blame the president okay\nSince when you can you blame someone else well when you want you when it's politically expedient for you\nWell let you hear what the president had to say and we'll hear some of this rhetoric being viewed by the left coming up at seven twenty\nYou know Sanderson Florida in business in Arizona for sixty three plus years they won the customer service awards from Ford Motor

here's the cinema loses a very key endorsement and she loses it from the Arizona State troopers association when I found out the state troopers association was endorsing cares in cinema I was very very surprised\nThat it didn't all line up with the troopers that I Know when I'm not saying all of the state troopers that I Know would be mix Sally supporters but I ... after the statements made by here since cinema being so anti war it it it seemed to me like they would want nothing to do with it and so I did talk with some people on the highway patrol that I Know and they were surprised so\nThe way the state troopers association has handled this very professionally or would they put out a statement that said our members started to speak out so they surveyed their members via email\nAnd the members said in this email they would rather stay neutral so they didn't bash here since ... they didn't do any of that but they pulled the endorsement\nBut might stop for over a channel three\nIn his report on this tells a little bit of a different story\nThere is sort of range of emotions from outright anger or\nIs there are members resigning\nAfter decades of membership over this this particular decision did not reflect the sentiments and feelings of the general membership\nSo that was I'm Sorry is might stop for is an association member state troopers association said that members were so angry about this they were going to pull their membership from the organization\n\nThat's huge that's bigger to me than pulling the endorsements because the troopers association were very politically correct as they should have been very professional in saying we gave this endorsement without the um permission or blessing of our members\nAnd so our members began to speak to us so they voted and they want to remain neutral that is very politically correct\nNow you've got members saying oh no no we were going to we were leaving we were getting out of the organization if they didn't pull this\nThat tells a different story but it tells you again people are beginning to see who cares in cinema is the anti war rhetoric and the other things that have happened data Garcia the anti police rhetoric\nAnd tell you something else that smacks\nOf desperation um I talk to you about Steve\nI'm my take on it she was caught lying about it\n\nYou lose this

... this is not one sided it is just blatant ... more from the media coming up 'cause I don't want to convoluted too\nBut you know as organizations what the media has done to this president by calling him mentally ill I mean they call him mentally ill we have um you have comedians that are uh you know cutting off his head in effigy\n\nYou know it's it's it's talking about the murder the president there have been people public figures tweeting out they want to see 'em dead it was Kamala Harris went on Ellen show and cracked a joke about killing people now it's all jokes I mean I Know they're all jokes\nBut you're going to say crazy people are gonna ... going to respond to Trump's rhetoric in a in a violent way that's not true insane people\nWhen I guess the mental mental illness has so many varying degrees I don't want to lump everybody together but the dangerously mentally ill no one knows what causes them to finally snap\nIt isn't until you start looking back in their lives the clue start making sense and in a lot of cases the clues or there for a long time here in Arizona that horrific shooting by Jared Loughner\nDown in Tucson and how Jared Loughner had was so devoid of a conscience the Jared law never had the ability to just indiscriminately shoot I mean he targeted Gabrielle Giffords there's no doubt he targeted the congresswoman and thankfully she lived\nBut many injuries were so severe to her\nBut then\nThe the killing of that little girl in a federal judge in bystanders and people are men one one guy was killed sheltering his wife from the bullets\nTo

your line without evidence your lying there is not a shred of evidence\nThat this is somebody sitting around wearing a make America great again hat and a Trump T shirt building these devices\nThere's no evidence of that yet and you are jumping to conclusions and so is the media\nSo the media wants the president to stop with the president said everything he was supposed to say in this situation he talked about the acts of political violence as a matter of fact play number two the president said everything he was supposed to say and yet the media which you're going to hear and a few moments is
