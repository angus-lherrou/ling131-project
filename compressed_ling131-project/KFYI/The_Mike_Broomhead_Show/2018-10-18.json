just after seven AM Corey Lewandowski joined us from recording Lewandowski making a big name for himself and a lot of headlines\nHeading up the Trump campaign is obviously someone that's been plugged in with the campaign and this administration and what's going on with the Republican Party and the potential for Republicans in the elections in the midterms can be a great conversation at seven oh two we start talking with with a Corey Lewandowski so stick around for that are set your alarm to make sure you're with us\n[noise] um [noise] this story about ... about the Saudi Arabian a reporter or what happened was Turkish reporter's Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul\nUm first of all let's say this as if there's if there was a horrific murder like this that is committed\nPeople should be held accountable I have no doubt about that none whatsoever but looking at um the what the way the media is handling this\nYou got to have a little bit you got to take a step back and take a look at what's happening in the bigger picture and um this is where I think they do themselves a disservice I'll get to that in a moment but I Want you to hear what pump a oh had to say this\nBecause Mike Pompeo is doing an investigation I'll be happening to us he went and spoke with the Saudis and he is also spoken with the Turkish officials\nAnd the investigation is ongoing so as the the red meat the reporters are looking for 'em and the so um they're looking for this red meat and pump a it was basically saying Saudi Arabia should have a chance to investigate\nThat this is an investigation that should continue and and that's only fair so what they're you know will you hear them your immediate response momentarily\nBut this is what Tom pale set about an investigation\nDon't want to talk about any of the fact\nThey they didn't want to either and if they want to have the opportunity to complete the investigation thorough way and I had I think that's I think that's I think that's a a reasonable thing to do to given that opportunity and then we'll all get the judge will all get to evaluate the work that they do\nAnd that is just being prudent\nBut he also talks about are we giving the Saudis the benefit of the out years there is something that we're doing this is how we address that\nI keep hearing that we're giving them some benefit\nThey're going to do an investigation [noise]\nIf it's that it is reasonable it's reasonable to\nDay or two completely so they get it right\nEvaluate the facts straight up\nAnd they're ... they're saying that that's not the case you're already getting that from members of the media so I'm Frank\nBruni who is with the New York times let's start there Andrew this is now the media's response to the way the White House has been handling this and depending on who you listen to in the media it goes from a one sided do absolutely absurd here's Bruni\nSo it's pretty late realization I mean from for days now from the beginning we've gotten a sense that what the president and his age want to do is help the Saudis launder their reputation somehow in the wake of this mutually agreeable version let's call it that what it is it's a lie\nAnd what I find sort of confounding here is President Trump wouldn't be the first president to put strategic interests have human rights\nWhy isn't he denounced the Saudis in public and then if he's concerned about the relationship picking up the phone in thing in private guys I gotta do this you know that\nUm but you know you're okay instead he's actually in a bizarrely transparent way saying I Want to help these guys bound to find a reputational way out of this you know I Want to say oh this ridiculous stuff about guilty until proven innocent rather\nThan coming out and saying this is a thickening situation is not something we endorse in this country this is not something we're willing to turn a blind eye to he's in public actually showing us how much he wants to help the crown prince find a way out\nIt's so you just don't even pay attention to that breaking news thing you know here in town across the country had the emergency alert system or the Amber Alert system and they are so rarely used except for when they're being tested when you hear that tone you stop to make sure it's a test and not a real crisis\nBecause it isn't over used\nThe media has been going after Donald Trump as an evil man for so long and so hard that it people tune it out so if there is a case where Donald Trump truly is as wrong as you say people don't even hear it and they don't hear it because that's all you ever say\nComing up\nAt six fifty we're gonna talk about some of these nations that it it's weird who the Democrats defend 'em they hate the Saudis but they love the Iranians

text and coming up right around seven oh two\n[noise] uh so we were talking\nAbout Iran which I find you know the fascinating bedfellows that we have made the reigning ... the Iranian regime in my opinion is the most dangerous in the world right now because they have the same\nIdeology is the north Koreans did but they are more active we know that they're still fostering terrorism across the entire world the middle east North Africa they are using their their games they were making financially to ramp up their other terrorist activities they\nHave in their constitution the demise of the Zionist state they hate Israel a few months ago there were Iranian missiles in Syria firing at\nIsrael there were on the ... a Syrian Israeli border firing missiles fortunately they were shot down by their by the defense systems of the Israelis but the Iranians are dead set on the demise of the western world but especially of of uh Israel\nBut it's their human rights record and what's funny about the left in America is they seem to be the human rights police\nAnd so you would think that their enemy number one would be the Iranians they're they're treating women as property or they they say there are no gay people in Iran it's because they murder them they hang them from cranes in the streets as an example I mean these are all fruits\nAnd yet the left because Obama cut a deal with them defends the deal and defends the Iranians\nHere's an example of just how I'm far in the dark ages they still are a an Iranian official put together a cheap little PR stunts\nBecause they wanted to pretend to government cares about the uh the there are people women will not be allowed to attend live soccer matches in Iran\nYou want to know why Andrew [noise] yes\nBecause the half naked athletes will turn them on too much and then they will become a sexually frustrated and do things that would be sinful\nOn site or any of the less than an obvious answer [laughter] times what's gonna happen

rate hike is possible fewer Americans are also finally for unemployment benefits Labor Department reports this morning that two hundred and ten thousand workers fault first time claims for jobless benefits last week that's five thousand you were in the week before the opening bell the Dow Jones\nOf the midterms overall the the blue wave that everybody keeps talking about uh what's your feeling on that you're so well connected with with campaigns and with things that are happening how do you feel about that blue wave are we going to see that in the house\nIn the house look I I think I'm going to make the prediction that the Republican majority is going to be smaller than the twenty three seats that they currently have today and historical precedent would tell us\nThat if you're a ... bomber a Bill Clinton he lost sixty three fifty four seats respectively in your first midterm elections but this president who was out campaigning for his policies is going to make a difference and if you remember just two years ago at this time the mainstream media said Donald trouble never when Hillary Clinton is going to win\nThe biggest election victory since Ronald Reagan's reelected Ninety eighty four and all the pundits were wrong and when you look race by race district by district places where this president is going to make sure that house stays Republican he's\nGoing to have a significant impact and I think if the election were held today and the margin is what it is today Republicans hold the house by one or two seats\nAnd that's a pretty bold tradition people are talking and I and I feel the same way you do but for me it feels almost emotional it's not as connected as you are to this of all the president's successes you listed a bunch of them with the economy which is overwhelming\nHis foreign policy has been much better than most of us including myself a magic and it was going to be um what do you think is his crowning subset is it the tax cuts and how they were just like you said or is it is a combination of all do things not just one\n... it's so many things the problem is this administration has done so much in the first Twenty one months that we often overlook all the successes we overlook the fact that this president\nHas fought for and gotten the release of twenty American hostages overseas in different capacities without paying one dime not a boatload of cash on a plane full of cash sent over for those things we don't talk about the fact that he goes out of the terrible Iran nuclear deal we don't talk about the fact that he renegotiated NAFTA\nSo that it is better for America for change and he's renegotiating bad trade deals\nWe don't talk about the fact that we've got the lowest unemployment in the African American and Hispanic and women community on record or that the economy is growing it over four percent or that the stock market is up Seventeen percent\nSince he took office or the four plus million new jobs created because he has done so much\nPeople overlook those things and look I remember the Obama administration the only thing he accomplished in the first two years of his administration was what we called Obamacare this president has\nTaken steps to get rid of Obamacare that individual mandate that was required and so many other things but you look at our relationships overseas now this is not a presidential we traveled with\nHe is re committed the US's dominance on the world market he has forced or their country to pay their fair share to NATO in the United nations and he has said if you make a commitment you better stick to it and when he draws a line in the sand on like the previous administration\nThere is no crossing that line without repercussions and that was clear with Bashir al Assad in Syria when he started using chemical weapons against innocent men women and children and he put a coalition together to go in to launch a strike against that sort of this\nHas been so much success\nBut if you listen to the mainstream media which Ninety percent of their coverage is negative of this president it's astonishing you would think that we're back in the great depression of the Nineteen
