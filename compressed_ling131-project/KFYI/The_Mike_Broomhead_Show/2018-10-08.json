Kavanaugh how all this plays into November and what he sees happening as always fun to talk with Eric Trump he's going to join us to talk all things White House but especially I think we're going to talk about the\nCampaign here in Arizona and what needs to happen to get Martha McSally across the finish line absolutely unimportant race could swing set it one way or the other it's funny how uh everybody's really looking closely at this race it's ... it's kinda fun to be the center that attention you know unless it goes the other way\nWell even see that and you know what I mean it but I

to overturn the election they pay the judge you know we're not going to let you pick the churches if you want to paint judges they need to win the White House\nI Love it I\nAbsolutely love it it's about time we started seeing some things like this and what I mean by that is there's going to be partisan issues we've seen it every single time but it always seems to be Republicans would have to reach across the aisle there was a great there were some great commentary and back and forth going on all over the weekend\nBetween people talking about now we don't have a swing vote you know we used to have a swing vote now we don't now you've got to have you know is is cabinet are gonna be a swing vote and somebody said when\nDoes when does your side of the I'll be the swing vote\nWhen there's Kagan or Sotomayor good across the aisle and disagree with the liberals on the court when does that happen\nWhy is it always the conservatives they have to reach across the aisle speaking of which Jeff lakes office aligned with protesters this weekend\nNow many of you get upset because I talked about having respect for Jeff Flake and I like Jeff as a person I'm and I'm not talking about Senator Flake I'm Talking about Jeff Flake demand\nI don't know if he's law we learned a lesson or is not learned a lesson but here's Jeff Flake risking everything he's ever built up an equity for politics every single thing he's had his family's safety his reputation everything\nTo reach across the aisle and from the minute Jeff Flake reach across the aisle they slapped his hand\nThe investigation is not good enough it's not long enough this is not what we wanted the Republicans is Republicans that\nJeff Flake was the only one that bucked his party and did what they wanted and there were still protesters outside of his office why because he said we need evidence there is no evidence\nWe still believe in innocent until proven guilty in this country and then he did what his conscience ed so he had a good conscience when he gave you what you wanted but he was back to being an evil Republican when he voted the way he did\nI don't know if if Jeff Flake is learning a lesson by this or not but you know I agree with bipartisanship in a sense of we should be trying to work together but when the other side of the aisle does not come with clean hands when they come to the argument or they come to the situation\nAnd they are uh they're doing it by um with with selfish intentions there's not an ounce of bipartisanship and any of them and that's what Lindsey Graham is pointed out you look

the Senate races are trending right\nIt looks as if we are going to pick up some seats in the United states set of how many we don't know but it looks like the Senate is safe on the other hand it looks like they're going and the other direction in the house to house may turn over to Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will find out and what can be done in both instances here in Arizona there is\nA ... we will have our first female senator\nUm she first female senator will be either\nA Marshall mix Sally or it will be here in cinema but it's not just in Arizona that this racist that important the entire country is watching that race now joining us is Eric Trump Eric welcome back to the show you give me your impression of what you saw with this confirmation process of of Brett Kavanaugh before we get into the elections\nI think it was ... am Mike I thought it was a circus I thought it was embarrassing um I thought what they did try and destroy somebody's family was was was horrible [noise] um\nYou know I I ... just about every aspect of it and it drove me crazy right I mean you you have to ... the first day the first day of he's hearing he get their cabinet get there at nine thirty in the morning [noise]\nYou didn't it's earthworm three thirty into three thirty in the afternoon because you had senator just sitting there grandstanding I mean they they sat there and they were grandstanding\nThe president up on the stage they were really talking to you know the viewers watching CNN they weren't they weren't you know they weren't there for Kavanaugh there were there for their own purposes and\nThat was embarrassing and then they came out even before they got to hear the guy and you know Ninety nine percent of them said that they are voting against him anyway and then sure enough and the eleventh hour all this other stuff happened to him and they literally tried to destroy a person's life and um you know it wasn't the fair\nJust hearing that you would expect from our nation's leaders\nThe argument aside when they argue about the politics of the Supreme Court which is really an oxymoron but when they argue about that that all seemed to be fair game but when you started attacking a person's character and it seemed like the one person that they were going to attack and find nothing was Brett Kavanaugh this seemed to be\nJust a really good young man that turned into a very good man and a good judge he's got two daughters your wife whose parents were alive and to explain his children then he's being accused of attempted rape\nHad to be so destructive his family\nYeah I was I think that's I I think that's right and you know the ... the way they come after um you know people on on the side of the aisle is um is insane I mean I've been subject to have everybody in our family has obviously\nIt but we've gotten pretty thick skin and you know\nOr or we can they should act but uh I mean the the way they will attack people is is unbelievable I mean my son's been attacked he's just turned one two weeks ago um you know a ...\nA ... you know who's you know and these young teens skits attacked all the time Tiffany who's you know a half sister you know nice girl a law school she gets attacked relentlessly I mean what you just don't do that I mean the you know the way they tried to destroy his family but they do to everybody I mean they do it to everybody and\nEverywhere let's not let any or progress\nHappened and that's what you would get if you elected a Democrat as governor in Arizona I mean I think is actually what you would get you know I mean they would stop cooperating they would do everything they could to read this you know everything that's all the progress that's being made and I'm One of the reasons Arizona's doing so well as you have a great person in there\nI I agree Eric we appreciate the time as always we know you've got other enemies to get to when we look forward if you're in Arizona to possibly a senior face to face\nLike I Love that\nAll right thanks a lot that's Eric Trump or joining us for just a few moments and it couldn't trust that any more you got to get out and vote that is imperative in November

I just I'm trying to look around and see where do we start which one is the one to kick this off and they just they're all great so let's start with Joe Lockhart crushing defeat\nThe big question in my mind is um I think this is in many ways a crushing defeat\nFor women and women's rights and the question is are people going to be energized by that women in general I meant before we have a a and women and their ability to have a voice or is it energizes him or will they say enough I I I Can't do this anymore\nAnd a\nCrushing defeat for women's rights it is not and there were a lot of women as a matter of fact there was a was a star sore the you know the the activists she introduced I'm Jill a brand at the at the rally\nBlames white women again we're back to racial stuff so ladies and this is interesting to me more than anything else\nYou're only a woman if they say you are it's kind of like the civil rights movement I asked a civil rights leader here in Arizona I Am very honest question is black about skin color because you keep hearing people say you're not black enough\nAnd this was from a civil rights leader and he said it's absolutely not just about skin color\nSo it's it's a mindset it's a way of life I guess so they want to blur gender lines in so many ways you're only really a woman if they say you are if you agree with them politically if you agree with them was socially\nSo this is not a defeat to women's rights with Joe ... is saying very articulate Lee is this is a crushing defeat to their belief in women's rights there is always going to be a pendulum swings and when you push hard enough in one direction people are going to push back and that's what you're seeing\n'em let's go to number Ken this [laughter]\nThrough Sunday for eight or nine eight twenty seven twenty seven arms ... the their\nHere's a new word come misery misery is the misery you feel when you sell your home the pay too much income mission here's another new word purple bricks purple bricks rescues you from commiserate with experience local real estate agents who charge a flat fee saving thousands on commission\nWhether you're buying or selling save yourself from ... misery a purple bricks dot com protected savings applying to sell a\nTransect brushes perspective this morning at ... five fifty KFYI [noise] [laughter]\n\nActually show where I Am [noise] let's\nLet's let's get a civics lesson let's start with fourteen Andrew let's go back to number forty and this is John ... um this is a civics lesson from the media and now this is not they're not saying this was a compliment this is a lemon station they're lamenting this fact but follow the thought process here or because you're getting a civics lesson\nOne interesting thing I think is that we now of course where we have one president was justice appointed by the one term president ah George W. Bush\nTo by Clinton to buy forty three two by Obama to by Trump so to some extent we now and not only is the way Harry Truman said we always get the government we deserve we now have the Supreme Court that follows the presidents we elect\n... why is that bat [laughter] up until this president it was good remember it was okay up until this president up until this president that's exactly the way it was supposed to be and the votes were never fifty to forty eight\nThe reason they were fifty forty eight and not fifty one forty eight or fifty one forty nine was a one Democrat didn't vote and then um\nShould say one Republican refused voter voted present that was Murkowski right and then there was a Republican senator who was that his daughter's wedding and when they knew they had the votes to confirm and they didn't need any more votes\nHe stayed at his daughter's wedding with the permission of the of the Republicans in the Senate which is why it ended up fifty forty eight and so this is um\nIt's funny to me that they're lamenting the fact that the president gets the gets to appoint Supreme Court nominees wait until there was a Democrat president and see what happens and an opening comes up wait and see\nWhat they do just remember these days the hypocrisy will be loud and clear let's go to Frank ... says no he is CNN I'm Talking about his number two Andrew this is the week the president's had\nWe know where the public trust numbers are [noise] um for the press generally somewhere down below the basement um look the fact of the matter is that by any reasonable measure this has been an extraordinary week for this president forget the Russia investigation forget the pack story forget all the rest\nA trade deal with Mexico and Canada unemployment numbers that haven't been this low since Nineteen sixty nine and following through on what he said which was to remake the Supreme Court and I try on with Kavanaugh himself\nThe coverage has been unrelenting Lee negative\nAnd he's won a hundred percent right did you see the tables started to turn a little bit tables turning just a little bit the reason why is because when you listen to it that way this is absolutely the truth is president should be at sixty to sixty five percent approval rating right now\nHe should be through the roof with approval rating why because of all the accomplishments of were just listed NATO was change we're now NATO nations are paying more money to be in NATO than we are or are they are catching up what we're paying we're not paying just the lion's share\nThe remake of NAFTA what's going on with the Chinese economy versus the U.S economy are low unemployment numbers wages going up tax cuts working\nAll of these things are huge wins for this president not to mention now once again the Supreme Court and keeping his promises this is a no brainer\nBut instead the media has played such a role in the negative coverage that is he's just over fifty percent continue the winning ways and see what happens [noise]\nSee what happens is they continue down this road [noise]\nComing up just after seven the Senate is not broken Mitch McConnell defense history and of course I told

of I Would say push going closer now to a week or so is we're starting to see some of the Republicans fight back and I thought they fought the good fight for Brett Kavanaugh because this was a man who

their stock market is off twenty percent this year\nThat these terrorists have hammered the Chinese economy whereas the American economy continues to grow I didn't ... I still not a fan of terrorists yeah\nBut I'm saying I didn't realize that the Chinese economy had been affected is such a great degree or drop us given that press conference over the last week I think it was he was talking about this deal that's being brought in particular from China and how they make it and how it's weaker than American Steel and it's being subsidized in order to put Americans deal out of business\nWas the first time I've really heard the president go into detail about\nWhy this and I was like oh there's another life because no one CNN certainly not talking about it they haven't replayed that combination that investigations into that which is another comment when the president speaks in those terms when the family speaks out in those terms with the business

door of the Supreme Court we have that video on the blog yet Andrew if you go to KFYI dot com keyword broom had it's embarrassing it is embarrassing there is a grown woman who is in such a state of um despair\nThat they want they're ... they're chanting shut it down and she is clawing as if she's um like like in a zombie apocalypse clawing at the door like she's trying to claw her way into the Supreme Court in this moment of absolute despondency\nGo and see those people even\nPeople that are posed Brett Kavanaugh are not represented by that idiocy but those are the people that get on television\nTaking the message\nOf what's reasonable to people matters focus on the prospects and not the suspects why stand on opposite sides of the street and throw rocks at somebody that hate your guts\nI have no desire to change the minds of the people that email me and send me messages and tell me what a horrible person I Am I understand that you ... ... you're entitled to your opinion I Would rather speak to the people a that listen\nAnd like the show but also people that are looking for a reasonable conversation even if they disagree with me and you can find those people that large group of independence that are going to decide these midterm elections are Republicans should be speaking to Lindsey Graham\nDoes a phenomenal job on Sunday the fights over Kavanaugh's confirmed Kavanaugh sworn in he is now justice Kavanaugh it's over\nBut now the fight continues because it's still a campaign slogan for the lap so Lindsey Graham points out the obvious by holding up a list of nominees the president's list of nominees and asking a very obvious question\nTwenty something people on this list I'm asking structure saying five main screen name why that would be okay with it\nFor Senate part of your day with us [noise]\nComing up just after eight o'clock more media reaction because of the way the media has been covering this Kavanaugh confirmations and then the aftermath because what is now going to the midterms a Fox News now reporting of Nancy Pelosi is is demanding documents\nAnd she's demanding documents because the Democrats in the house may open a an investigation into Brett Kavanaugh should they take over the majority which I Hope that's their plan and I hope the other um media outlets cover of this\nRemember when you go to the polls remember when you go to the polls\nMartin makes Sally is leaving the house to run for the Senate soda gears in cinema there are Republicans and Democrats in those races I've told you about Steve Ferrara Steve Ferrara running against um\n[noise] uh what's his name Greg Stanton the former mayor of Phoenix and important race choose wisely get out and vote motivate your neighbors to get out and vote send the message about these investigations in the idiocy\nBut this takes a different turn what you're about to hear President Trump was saying that a lot of those protesters were paid protesters which we saw was true we've seen the photographic and video evidence of people being paid to protest\nSo Scarborough on MORNING Joe along with Mika Brzezinski have a weird take on that statement from the president\nProtesters were not found have headed by their concern is that by pay tax on millionaires ... said\nQuote what am I that's a very old tired at ease\nAddict [laughter]\nVery very old anti Semitic or that people have have usually on the Internet make\nDid he um\nDid he ... the words he wanted he did he mean anti Semitic this is somehow anti Jew she said it twice because it's arose Soros Jewish I don't know the answer that question\nSo first of all they deny they laugh at the fact that it's possible they laugh at the fact the protesters got paid this is an old trick unions have been doing this for years unions pay union members to protest I'll tell you a secret you know when you walk when you drive around the valley\nAnd you see those people standing under umbrellas and they've got the PVC pipe set up with the the big sign you know the big of a sign on a tarp that says shame on such and such a business a big red letters those are union members that are being paid for the day to stand there and protest\nThey are paid protesters that doesn't mean they don't believe what they're saying but they are being paid to be there when they bust people into protests and marches they're being paid\nABC News so now Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski mock the idea of paid protesters first of all and then they called anti Semitic\nListen to it ABC News I saw the President's Day these are professional protesters paid by George Soros et cetera et cetera what what what is more of these people what was that we\nAre also some people who are organized and that moment was halfway around the hell we talked to one woman who works for ultraviolet list pain\nShe helps people in the right way is trained well to to confront were paid there were people who are paying by organizations like ultraviolet can you can try to harness that energy and away when the viral moments that we ended up staying\nSo the\nPresident's not lying he still anti Jew apparently [laughter] even though you know it was family and stuff and\n[noise] oh yeah this is daughter convert yes in his son in law is Jewish\nBuddies and he's anti Semite that was an anti Semitic statement\nThis is the laughable\nThings that they say and then they expect to be taken seriously ABC News well yeah of course there were people that were pay they were\nIt may happen on the other side I protested\nThe building of the nine eleven memorial here in Arizona because I think it was a pathetic attempt at a political ... job that's my personal opinion\nWhere a piece of steel from the twin towers was donated by retired firefighters and there were political statements all over this thing they actually the original people to build the nine eleven memorial want it to lift the name of the terrorists were killed the nine eleven along with those that were dead and have their numbers counted that's just a fact\nUh I don't think the nine eleven memorial we call it the ... 'cause that's what it looks like wasn't appropriate Memorial Day nine eleven I thought it was politically motivated in many ways so I protested it\nAt the time we took we took a letter along a friend of mine named Mike McAvoy who was a survivor or his brother and his best friend both perished on that day we took a letter up to the governor's office and handed it to the office of governance pilots on all at the time in protest\nYou want to know what the Arizona Republic asked who's paying for this who's paying for you guys who's your public relations people who's paying for the set up with this who paid for all those who paid for this who paid for that\n[noise] they want to know if we were paid protesters I was not nor do we have any paid protesters with us\nNone none I can say that confidently but you know Joe Scarborough caused him an anti Semite just after eight o'clock\nThe media reaction you'll hear from CNN MSNBC some of the big\nNames you know and what they had to say about this what does the ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh really mean to the people\nIt is just amazing\nWhat you're hearing from the media and the fallout and how long will last stick around [noise]\n\nFrom going to make a good morning\nWhere I knew from I'm Rob ... President Trump's son Eric killing five fifty can't why I might ... the president is flooding are making\nA trip here ahead of next month's midterm election will be out\nThere and um and it will certainly be out there and um you know we've been working very very hard or gay continue to work hard because we we believe\nEric Trump saying Arizona is an important states these midterms so they're going to come out supports Republicans like governor Doug do state won a second term Brannon first term for Republican Senate candidate Martha Mick Sally up also saying the walls being built in strategic places on the U.S Mexico border\nFrom on President Trump's that he's going to meet with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein well looks like that and meeting it's gonna happen today\nFox News has confirmed the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein will accompany President Trump on the air force one today for the president's speech at a convention of police chiefs where he'll speak about law enforcement issues\nThere trip together comes a week and a half after the two were scheduled to discuss remarks Rosenstein had reportedly made about the president's fitness for office\nAnd an offer to secretly taped conversations with him during a news conference at the un President Trump said that he did not want to fire Rosenstein who was denied the reports that he had been willing to secretly taped the president at the White House John decker Fox\nNews it was just saying a few minutes ago he's a good relationship with Rosenstein sort of pan handle getting ready for a hurricane right now it's tropical storm Michael it's near Cuba but it's headed north could be a category to store by the time makes landfall later this week Florida governor Rick Scott urging people in other

Would never use it again does that mean that I Can't work in that community that I'm not allowed to go into those classrooms anymore\nBut is would we get the same with the vice president of digital partnerships give the same reaction if those tweets were Sean Hannity's\nRight or Glenn Beck's or\nEven a producer a reporter over\nFox News what do you have the same exact response\nWouldn't but the fact that this person has to apologize for something like that again\nSo here's a lesson for all of you and most kids now don't need do I and maybe you do um be careful what you say on social media you know what we would say in a group of friends what we used to say in a group of friends that you know I disappears now you can say I set it and I can say I didn't because there's no proof\nEverything you do on social media somebody's going to dig up it's just going to unfortunately that is tied do you like an anchor for ever you know how many kids are counseled in college don't post stuff on social media you want to know why because you're going to be a senior in a year\nOr two and your potential employers are going to go to your social media pages and see you doing a a you know a keg stand\nUm you know or a beer pong or whatever\nAnd that's going to be a part of your job interview and chances are the person that's hiring you did the same thing in college but they don't want to see it on social media this has got to be just\nHorrible horrible\nSo let's go to Joe Lockhart Andrew number nine let's get this one and there's another\nMedia reaction that this confirmation is a crushing crushing defeat\nPerfect question in my mind is um I think this is in many ways a crushing defeat for women and women's rights and the question is are people going to be energized by that women in general I'm man before we have a a and women and their ability to have a voice\nIs an energized them or will they say enough I I Can't do this anymore\nWell let's find out because we've got a race going on in Minnesota for the attorney general's office where Keith Ellison is on the ballot is Keith Ellison gonna win should here's accuser be believed out of hand there's a lot more evidence there is no evidence against Brett Kavanaugh there's evidence in this case Keith Ellison are they running from support for Keith Ellison\nSurvivors have to be believed\nComing up at eight

not talking about the and I'll be honest with you I Love the right to\nProtest I've been involved in a couple of things where I've witnessed protest I Do think it's what makes us great as a nation overall and if you look at some of the historic protests and marches um some of them are ominous some of them are inspiring or you look at the uh I mentioned the story before standing on Capitol Hill\nOn the Capitol lawn getting ready to give a speech at a at a pro troops rally in Washington DC in two thousand four\nAnd um it was an amazing sight to stand on this stage with the Capitol rotunda behind me and looking out to pass the Washington Monument and all the way down to the Lincoln Memorial\nAnd looking at the Lincoln Memorial and saying man that that is where Martin Luther king junior gave the I have a dream speech that march in that time in American history where attention was being paid to the Jim Crow laws and and changes were being made\nThe ominous ominous ominous um video overhead video if you've never seen it all the opposite side of that of the clan marches to Washington DC with the white hoods and how common is in retrospect those marches were in Washington DC\nSo protests have always been a part of America but I'm not talking about that\n[noise]\nWith Eric Trump son of the president Erickson a guest on the show before phenomenal gas very outspoken they

interview it's always good to speak with a first family pretty pretty big on our soil he's a great guest and I want you to hear from him [noise]\nUm shift very quickly from the Kavanaugh\nSaying to something else\nAccording to the un governments around the world must take rapid far reaching in unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming according to this report from the global scientific authority on climate change\nFlawed science as it is\nThe great thing about this is they now warn that the report\nWas in the un inter governmental panel on climate change said the planets will reach the crucial threshold of one and a half degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit above pre industrial levels\nAs early as twenty thirty precipitating the rescue of extreme drought wildfires floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people\nSo here's the quote Andrew King a lecturing climate science at the University of Melbourne [noise]\nThis is concerning because we know there are so many problems in it if we uh exceed one and a half degrees C global warming including more heat waves hot summers\nGreater sea levels and for many parts of the world's worst droughts in rainfall extremes global net emissions of carbon dioxide would nearly would need to fall by forty five percent from twenty ten levels by twenty thirty to reach net zero around twenty fifty [noise]\nHere's what they failed to tell you according to the eye PCC which is the organization to put the study together for example they know that there is only low confidence regarding changes in global tropical psych low numbers under this plan over the last four decades they point this out an\nInconvenient data much of the eyepiece cc's twenty Thirteen climate assessment the new special report confirms was wrong\nBut don't expect to hear that for example the Washington Post write up on the IPC sees report focus on the main line findings namely the world is woefully off target New York times highlighted a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires\nBut what they don't tell you is it they have no faith in the science when it comes to droughts for example the BCC admits there was low confidence in the sign of drought trends since Nineteen fifty at the global scale\n[noise] when I was a child in the early Nineteen seventies it was just the opposite the fear was global cooling there was an impending ice age look it up same scientists same science it was going to be a global freeze we were going to starve to death because there would not\nBe a thaw long enough to grow food so unless we were going to build green houses all over the world we were going to start this was in the Nineteen seventies they've been talking about climate change back then it was going to be the global ice age go read about it\nSo all of your all of your college kids that are believing in this nonsense going look at the science from the seventies\nIs complete complete foolishness and idiocy [noise] just after nine o'clock you're going to hear from Eric Trump the son of the president coming up and just a moment Rush Limbaugh we need
