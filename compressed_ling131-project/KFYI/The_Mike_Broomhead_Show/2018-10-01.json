are moving in that direction joining us as mark laughter or tell us what you're hearing about this investigation Martin\nWell I think I think when we get to the end of the week\nThe end of this investigation we're going to exactly what we already though today\nA Dr Ford has her accusations judge Kavanaugh has denied them vehemently and all of the people that Dr Ford has named as being but then to witness to say that I don't know what she's talking about\nA so we'll get through this process if that's what's needed to uh for for Senator Flake and for Senator Murkowski and Collins and maybe a couple of the the moderate Democrats\nI think it showed that we took the allegations seriously but we still don't have any cooperating evidence and the judge Kavanaugh said the fact is the the that the witnesses are reviewing it\nWell they keep it seems as if the Democrats in the in this committee keep moving the goalpost first it was we want an investigation Mazie Hirono said we need at least a background check you out and we know is a joke in what's already been done\nSo they agree to a one week investigation now they're saying one week isn't enough and now it's way too limited and now they're saying they should be investigating perjury what does he lie to the to the to the committee about how much drinking he did so in the end is this going to be are they going to find a way to kill this nomination do you think\nWe're going to hope to but let let's be honest I mean the the the Democrats are moving the goalposts so much not even Tom Brady could score this so I think what you're going to see is that Jeff Flake and gang Chris Coons made a deal for a week\nAnd if we get to the end of the week there are no serious new allegations that and the FBI does that work at the information comes back as we know it I think you'll see Senator Flake and I would hope you with the Senator Flake at ... Collins Murkowski maybe mansion go\nWell we asked for a week you got a weak let's vote and I think that's what you're going to see from uh from leader McConnell I think he's going to call for the the process votes to begin on friday and and move this fall over because they're just continuing time and time again to move those goalpost and let's not forget\nThese are the same people who had fill in the blank news releases and protest posters the day of the announcement of judge Kavanaugh just fill in the blank we're going to be opposed to whomever President Trump nominated\nSo on the political side of this ... I was looking at some stories this morning saying that the motivation now in the Republican base is growing immensely because of this even started before this but is this are you seeing people finally saying this is not how the process is supposed to go and seeing it motivating Republicans to the polls in November\nI Do and I'll tell you I was home ah back at my home state of Indiana last week or a ... doing some of my daughter was getting married and I heard from a lot of it even from moderate suburban female of voters who\nTypically aren't necessarily even a you know enamored with some of the things that the president has said they've even had enough of this there like they are just running this guy's a ringer looking for a problem so they can oppose him and it's actually getting them fired up to be able to come out and make sure that we're supporting candidates\nIn the United States Senate race who will actually go on to keep them from more judges and justices like Brett Kavanaugh or in our house races to make sure that I mean there are some Democrats and and socialist that are talking about impeaching him if he's confirmed it's\nTheir radicalism has gone totally off the deep end and I think it's actually going to come back and bite them and I hope that the voters out you know in Arizona they're thinking about what that what they go to the polls\nBecause your senator and your Congress people are gonna be the ones that make these decisions about future justices or whether the the radicals are going to go down the impeachment road with judge Kavanaugh or president\nOr just even keeping tax cuts in place\nMark Warner is a former advisor to President Trump also press secretary for vice president Pence um\nWhat do you think needs to happen all the good things that are

and some of this other stuff to stop being on the front page\n[noise] it's Monday October first\nWhat news today on the free I heart radio as high\nOr your week with all the best ... station all in one habit rocked up maybe ... ... talk radio original vision my only fear in\n\nBiggest name in talk Rush Limbaugh this morning at ten minute talk five fifty KFYI [noise]\nMe or something like ... show on Saturday morning Saturday afternoon I was with a group of Republican women was Arizona federation of Republican\nIn their state convention great group I mean phenomenal group one of the biggest most powerful group of women of voters in the country and it was really interesting to be in that in that room\nAnd compare and contrast that with some of the idiocy that we see out there it's this when they talk about the war on women why not have if women's voices are so important\nWhy not allow the voices on both sides of an issue to be out there\nIf you disagree with the accuser in this case if you're a woman and you disagree with Brett Kavanaugh's accuser you have no say no one's going to listen to you and I was in a room full of women that don't hate this woman I'm\nSure a lot of these women in the room had their own stories of having to deal with if not being assaulted with some inappropriate behavior\nI'm sure they all have a story about it but when you hear women in a room like this talking about how horrible it is what's being done to Brett Kavanaugh and you wonder why if you truly are you interested in the voices in the opinions of women why aren't you listening to these voices\nAnd ah they were just a phenomenal group of engaged voters\nYou go to California and California they're more liberal leaning as a state they are supposed to be the party of women that's those are the ones that are pro women matter of fact they passed a piece of legislation in California\n[noise] requiring any publicly traded company that's based in California\nJab at least one woman on its board by the end of next year now I don't know if that means they're gonna have to create a position an ad a woman to it fire a man and hire a woman I don't know but that's going to be a legislative requirement\nIt all sounds good in theory I think doesn't it I mean it does you think we want to give we should but corporations are are slaves to the bottom line and they're going to do what's best for their company\nGE just replace the c._e._o. because gee is struggling right now\nCorporations have to make sure they're answering to the bottom line and when women are qualified to be whether it's the c._e._o. you know look at the um the arena Carly Fiorina and are successful career in business you look at other people here's another example it was Katie Couric was on lamenting the fact that ... cable\nWell news is still dominated by men in their boards of directors except for one what cable news network has a lot of women on their board yeah it's Fox News the war on women network Fox News\nWell Katie Couric didn't know that and Katie Couric doesn't pay attention to that because it doesn't fit the narrative that there is a war on women\nAnd this false set of rules that somehow supposed to be empowering all it does is breed animosity\nIf a woman gets a job because they're forced to hire her no one is going to take her seriously and now everybody walks on eggshells everybody gets upset instead of hiring people based on their merits there are so many women out there that are qualified for just about every job there is in the world\nAnd when they are they should get a shot at the job they should get a job because of the merits that they bring to the job because of the qualifications not because somebody force them to hire them that doesn't change anything doesn't change anybody's hearts doesn't change anybody's minds\nAnd the idea that people on the right side of the aisle want to keep women barefoot and pregnant is so outdated in old it's because you don't know anybody\nIn the Republican Party\nType people need to wake up coming up at seven o'clock motivated\nVoters this Brett Kavanaugh situation and others has got Republicans more motivated and

here in the Mike brunette show I'm here until ten AM we appreciate part of your data Brett Kavanaugh investigation continues and I'm\nOne of the things I've I've stayed away from for the most part is is getting emotional about these things I've done it more as an observation I think the biggest problem here is\nUm this could happen to anyone this could happen to anyone\nIs what's scary about this we have a justice system with the presumption of innocence\nNow the Democrats are making every excuse in the book for horrible behavior this is disgusting behavior there is not an ounce of proof against Brett Kavanaugh if this was such a serious issue why didn't Dianne Feinstein make this the centerpiece of their investigation\nWhy didn't they do something about this in July when she got the letter the woman said she wanted to remain anonymous for anonymity could have been protected with private closed door hearings but instead they sat on this thing\nUntil the very last\nHour she recommended that this woman get a lawyer from the very beginning\nBut no one's going to investigate the way that was handled\nSo I Want you to hear the despicable actions of people here's the progression\nMazie Hirono beginning of this process when they were pushing forward with all of this Mazie Hirono lamenting the fact that these women haven't been heard\nThis is what I mean that has come for theirs has nothing to gain from coming for she hardly fix to be re victimized family ties and this is exactly what's happening and it has to wait till off and\nThis is why said yesterday that only getting these women seem to be hurt they need to be the lead\nWithout getting 'em too far off the track\nJust Google Search it\nHow many times have women been one hundred percent positive that demand that they are accusing of rape is the rapist there one hundred percent positive and this is in immediately reported\nCases of Mahler station\nThat they were accosted by such and such a man and they've testified and I and ... so they have been said that the man that did it to me only to find out through ... DNA evidence that they were wrong\nHow many times go look I've looked it's scary\nNo one is calling I haven't heard anyone call this woman a liar\nNot even Kavanaugh Kavanaugh said it just wasn't him\nAnd there's not an ounce of evidence that backs that up but Mazie Hirono said back then\nShe should be heard let's hear what she has to say so they heard from her\nSo once her testimony was done now we need an FBI investigation right maybe\nYou don't have an FBI investigation is that the core of all of them have been saying yes not that\nWhat you've been saying is she should be able to testify she testified now you want an FBI investigation how about this the FBI has investigated this man six times with background checks\nEither there's nothing there\nOr the FBI really sucks to background checks\nOne of the FBI sucks background checks and they didn't get this information before what makes you think they're going to do a better job now\n\nFact of the matter is the FBI is very good at what they do these background\nChecks are intense their thorough they are deep and there was never a shred of this kind of behavior alluded to or he wouldn't have been seen it in the places he's been seated\nBut we want an investigation\nThan they were going to ask the questions about her testimony well first of all the FBI now we know is talk to the second accuser\nCompletely going to be discounted there's not a chance in hell that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be even come close to being touched on that Ramirez case the third accuser the one that uh was being brought forward by um ... she's going to disappear quickly that that's a joke not even the Democrats are talking about that anymore\nBut they're going to look into the validity of these they're going to go talk to the witnesses the people that all wrote letters and said one what's funny is one of the witnesses said I Believe this happened to her and I believe Brett Kavanaugh did it but I wasn't there like she said I was\nI just believe her story others said Brett Kavanaugh never behaved that way that's not the Brett Kavanaugh I knew and I wasn't there either never was at that party with that\nShe has no cooperating evidence so I think the media realizes that this is going nowhere fast so there's a new narrative start with number one Andrew here is the new narrative on the investigation\nForget about even the questions you guys have raised great questions about the scope of what the FBI is allowed to do if they're investigating questions of sexual misconduct here's another question\nIs perjury or an issue that the FBI wild investigating but there are many people who look a judge Kavanaugh his testimony was we can say it looks like he lied about a wide variety of things under oath under oath in front of this committee\nYeah it looks like it it looks like he lied\n\nThis is again a witch hunt we're going to find a way to disqualify him we're investigating collusion with the president and the Russians oh look at this look what this guy did over here Thirty years ago financially let's go wreck him\n\nThis is people on the left that lost the election they can't stand losing now they're going to lose their majority on the court and they just can't stand losing\nBrett Kavanaugh by a get a look at all the women that are coming out\nAnd supporting Brett Kavanaugh from his childhood from his years in college from his years working in the Bush administration\nLook at the number of women that have come forward for Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh is going to be I was going to say was going to be is going to be one confirmed the first Supreme Court justice with all female clerks\nNo one isn't it weird there's two Brett Kavanaugh's right now there's the one that rapes women and there's the guy that's really good to women because there's nobody in between there was nobody saying\nBrent Kavanaugh said inappropriate things to me Brett Kavanaugh grab my butt grab my breast grab was trying to fill me up at a party no one is saying that I never had an inappropriate conversation never told me if I wanted to grow in my career that I Would do certain things with them never asked\nMe out on a date and never did anything not one woman\nBut he's a rapist it's just absurd\nBut now there's a new and there's your new new monitor uh one of the line 'cause I've got witnesses that want to come forward and so you know what I saw him drunk in college\n\n\nDrunk in college how many of you that went to college um should be precluded from a job but it's a lifetime appointment might\nDrunk in college he said he drank in college he said sometimes he drank too much said he never got drunk he never got blackout drunk and he never got so drunk that he didn't remember that's what he

let me just step out on a limb here\nYou want to get involved you want to do something um you want to feel like your vote and your voice matters seek out this Republican women's organization statewide it's one of the strongest in the country these are dedicated people to the right issues it's just it's a great group it is really a great group\nBut again it's politically motivated these are people

this bubble because the bubble is what's making it's making me crazy I'm getting sucked back into this I'm getting sucked into the motion of it I'm getting sucked into all of it and I don't want it what I Want is the process to be fair\nI don't believe Brett Kavanaugh did this I think this woman is mistaken and I think the way the Democrats are handling this because they don't want this guy on the court because of how they believe it's going to offset the balance is disgusting\nAnd I would hope that I Would believe it was disgusting if it was happening toward a a Democrat nominee\n[noise]\nSo I Want you to hear where it started Jeff Flake on friday put out a statement that said I Will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh then he gets confronted in the elevator then he goes

that's how it started so Jeff Flake and Chris Coons last\nNight go on sixty minutes and they are discussing this\nWhat's funny is are they talking about whether or not Brett Kavanaugh raped anyone or
