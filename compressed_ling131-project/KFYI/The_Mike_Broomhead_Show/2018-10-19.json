imagine that\nThis is a way that she believes is going to get her and gray she ate it with the tax payer I think it's a great idea Kamala Harris wants to give couples making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year a tax cut of five hundred dollars a month\nThat's a six thousand dollar a year tax cut additionally\nShe also wants to get working families individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nWould get two hundred and fifty dollars a month or three thousand dollars a year\nNow I've got to tell you when you're when you hear very liberal Democrats talking about tax cuts I mean it's amazing what's funny about this is everything goes out the window whether they like it or not now when they talk about the ... the Bush tax cuts the way they were in only keeping them in place to working families\nAnd then the Trump tax cuts for everyone decimate in our budget what's funny about all of\nThis is if the deficit is being negatively affected by the Trump tax cuts how to more tax cuts help and you say Mike what's it's not taxes\nOn the rich it doesn't matter you're taking three thousand dollars or six thousand dollars a year from every family one hundred thousand dollars or less out of\nOut of the budget\nSo do you think and this is what I imagine is going to happen\nIs um I imagine Kamala Harris is going to come forward and say here's the way we need to do this we must then turn around and pick up the taxes on the wealthiest Americans because they can afford it\nFor every working family that is going to benefit to the tune of five hundred a month by the way those are the exact same crumbs Nancy Pelosi was talking about so I guess Kamala Harris wants to give you crumbs\nWell if the tax cuts\nAre the crumbs she wants to give the working families can be offset by somebody of means of wealth\nAnd it's going to be a wash well there are a lot more Americans that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars than there are the wealthiest Americans all but they can afford it isn't that interesting what they say is that they can't afford it\nHave you ever been I don't know how you feel about this but it doesn't matter how much money you make when you
