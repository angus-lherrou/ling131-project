news isn't this funny there is a job growth slump in September because everybody's got a job\nUnemployment rate fell two tenths of a percent of three point seven percent the lowest since December Nineteen sixty nine\nAlmost fifty years our lowest unemployment\nAnd one tenth of a percentage point below expectations non farm payrolls rose a hundred and thirty four thousand well below the estimate of a hundred and eighty five thousand and its worst performance in a year\n[noise] so the closely watched average hourly earnings component showed a to point eight percent year over year increase which is great\nAugust initial job account was revised up dramatically from two hundred and one to two Seventy while the July numbers went from one forty seven to one sixty five so job creation for September failed the lowest level in a year the unemployment rate dropped to a point not seen it almost fifty\nUm so the left will complain about this all looking at is the job growth is slowing down which I think it's hysterical at some point how many more people can you fit in there\nAnd it's terrific\nI mean it really is the economy is going in a great direction Dow approaching twenty seven thousand NASDAQ is up as soon as he is up the problem is still\nWe're beginning to see inflation has to do with terrorists I mean I don't like the terrorists either the president says in the end it's going to work out better for us if we can end this trade war with China imagine what this economy is going to do people are making more money and they're getting better benefits because the job market is so good\nAlso look at the residual effects on the health care exchanges which nobody likes still I mean I don't like the health care exchanges but the changes and the they said all Trump is decimate ing Obamacare Trump is ruining Obamacare\nObamacare's improved\nArizona's gonna see a decrease in rates for people on the exchanges you're going to see an increasing number of carriers that are going to be in the exchanges they had to fight tooth and nail to get ... county\nOne option in the exchanges in that county\nNow there's looks like it's going to be three four five maybe in there where people have a real choices rates are going down and another reason why rates are going down for insurance is more people have employer based insurance why to more people have employer based insurance because companies are keeping more of their profits with reduction in corporate taxes\nSo they're reinvest that money because in order to keep quality employees you must entice them some way\n\nIn the job market employer knows there's only so much money they can pay someone a job is worth only so much\nSo you find other incentives to keep people around with some kind of an incentive package whether it's a four O. one K. or health care whatever it is that you do to entice people to stick around in the construction world when things were going so crazy\nI'll just go from the electrical contractor point of view which I was ... you knew that if a guy decided not to show up at work\nThat I'm you'd fire him or he you know you give somebody a couple of chances and

in some parts of his testimony which parts of his testimony you know the eight of his friends came out and said the devil's triangle is drinking game\nEight friends came out said that's what that

deadline it's printed on the cover of the investigation page one gives you the deadline everyone does\nEvery nominee every nominee or candidate for an office a job that crosses the FBI desk for these

horrible things we're seeing how do we get rid of and make that leadership change so that the good people to be I can do their jobs what needs to change to make that\nHappen with the first thing that we did a about a year ago\nIs we actually gave authority to the secretary or the secretary to actually permanent people\nTrying to move into more of an at will employs instead of civil service employees because if they are at where we can you can terminate them and you can go and say you know you're not performing so you need to go and that was the first thing it just hasn't been implemented or executed\nAnd it's because it's a massive bureaucracy so the first thing we need to do is start that right at the top and get that flowing and then the second thing is we need to have better communication and ah ah we and and that's what my bills trying to do is get the communication that association between oversight\nI'm so we can say look here's the problems and we can take them back to the ... a federal level and say this is what you mean to streamline because it's so your credit and you're right there are a lot of great people working here in Phoenix and I don't hear nothing bad stories but\nJust to him good stories and a lot of a lot of bad stories and it's just so your credit\nAnd somehow it seems to be interest right here in Phoenix\nAnd congressman big joining

let the d._a. clinics focus on some of the things they do well where does that stand with everyone\n[noise]\nIt is a lot of support in Congress I Am supportive of that and uh you know we we we know this is by creating choice you can look at people that go on out and they're going to be able to go to the marketplace the way it's now you have people driving to drive safe from ... in San Diego to be to be hoped\nUm and that that's not good either so the choice card is going to make it a services more accessible and more quickly if you're part of the problem is the wait times are still huge\nAnd that means if you have something that needs to be resolved fairly quickly it ends up being exacerbated because you're waiting all this time so yeah the choice cord expansion is is really strongly support in Congress and we need to finish the deal there\nWill congressman it's always good to talk with you I look forward to avenue in Studio again when you're back in town\nThinks Mike

makes me so angry about the media it's not the left it's not the Democrats and the Senate they're doing what they always do just like the Republicans do\nBut when you're in the media when you know for a fact that the Democratic party and the senators and the Democrats in the Democratic party\nHad a form already filled out where you just plug in the name of the nominee that said this person's

vote there was some discussion among\nSome of the members but on the couch catching some colleagues or by surprise or the question still remains I was just talking to people in the leadership on both sides what will happen on that confirmation vote they do not know for sure if there are the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nLisa Murkowski was motionless when she cast her vote and that took three

party lines one Republican flipped one Democrat flipped still end with fifty one forty nine Joe Manchin the Democrat slipped away yes Lisa Murkowski\nThe Republican flip to winnow so right now it's fifty one forty nine going to a full vote or the Senate sometime after two o'clock Arizona time tomorrow um some things will play into the timing of that vote which we will bring you up to date\nOn and just a bit wanted to mention some what is really good news and should be talked about a lot more than it is or the job numbers the job numbers have come out now job numbers are less than predicted\nAnd lower than they've been in a year as far as job growth although it's still pretty strong growth there they have these high expectations because of the way that it's been going and what we're now seeing is the job numbers are showing\nThat a three point seven percent unemployment that is the lowest in almost fifty years the lowest in forty nine years\nDecember of Nineteen sixty\nNine was the last time\nWe saw unemployment this low in America now that is remarkable and it's something that we should also take into consideration is wages continue to climb so wages are going up and jobs are being created\nAnd the this is very very very good news for the economy the job numbers have been adjusted up the last few months will these be adjusted up in the end we don't know but it still shows great growth in our economy the the fly in the ointment do and it's funny that we're saying this 'cause we're growing it's such a paste things are moving along it's such a big pace in America\nThat to say that the what's holding us back almost seems silly but it is the the trade war that's going on with China the fears of an old all out trade war with the other economy the other strongest economy in the world is a concern so far the the president's been handling that are navigating that fairly well\nAnd\nYou know but to see job numbers where they are just the unemployment at three point seven percent that's basically full employment now the unemployment numbers can be skewed and fudge sometimes they're not you know they're played with by people but if you look at the overall consumer confidence in America\nHighest level of confidence with working class Americans the paycheck to paycheck single and couples and families those are the highest level right now of consumer confidence they're seeing more money in their paychecks they're paying less in taxes and they're making more in wages\nAnd for working families that is a huge difference if we can keep a clamp on gas prices\nThat's going to be a big big push\nComing up obviously in the final hour the show we will talk about what happened in the Senate this morning the boat that was taken\nWe'll talk to you about the importance of what happens tomorrow in the full vote for confirmation or not in what might happen coming up next Rush Limbaugh and his update the Democrats once again have an intern problem what is that in certain problem he's going to tell you and it's brought to you by nationwide vision so I Want you to stick around for the next hour Limbaugh next [noise]\nI'm Roger ... gonna be a big day in Washington as the full Senate will vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee\nBrett Kavanaugh Fox News's Jared how Vernon\nWashington and lift the one forty nine vote came a result of three or four undecided senators who were heading into this vote voting yes on this procedural move that would set up a final confirmation vote Republican Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin\nSupported advancing judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the U.S Supreme Court Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no\nStill there is some drama before a final confirmation vote that's expected to happen tomorrow and that's because Susan Collins who voted yes on this procedural motion to limit debate\nSo she will not amounts how she will vote on final confirmation until later today\nIf need be vice president Mike Pence will cast a tie breaking vote if it's a fifty fifty votes another big question Arizona Senator Jeff flake how's it going to vote tomorrow it was employers creating one hundred thirty four thousand new jobs in the month of September lower than expected but the unemployment rate falling to three point seven percent hasn't been that low since Nineteen sixty nine\nA Thirteen year old boy has bitten by a shark and in California now one of the hospital Qena Weber have survived getting attacked by what's believed to be a great

means please it is exculpatory evidence\nThis woman said I Believe forward but I wasn't there\nThe FBI former FBI agent tried to get her to change your story and she wouldn't and she had to turn over text messages to that effect\n\nSo I Want you to hear let's let's go to Jeff Flake know Jeff Flake you're going to hear him he's being questioned he's trying to get into his car and so the reporters obviously just like they went after Collins or after flake trying to get Jeff Flake to come\nAnd go after work at it and you find do you have ...\n... S C I\nWay I'm Glad we got a better process what selling out\nA guy in my early ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise] but he has thrown its racial\nWhat kind of conversation with senator mentioned [noise]\nUm [noise] that was a [noise]\n[noise] five miles of show [laughter] that's a tough decision about half\nAfter I was tired of course yeah [laughter]\nFigure we've all vaccines\nAre typical for fishing for everybody [noise] earlier so a\nGood our best hope\nSo Senator Flake saying that he is going to vote yes unless something drastically changes and he doesn't think that that's going to happen\nSo Senator Flake sticking by his yes vote he's not going to denounce Murkowski and he's not going to say much about what he is he's the white guy they asked him about conversations with mansion and he said I let him characterized those conversations he said I admire both of them a great deal this is a tough process um\nAnd Jeff Flake said I'm just glad we had a better process you had a better process with the same results\nIn in the minds of the American people no one's minds were changed no one's minds were changed that's my problem with this\nMy problem is you prolong the process for this nominee who was a good man and his family being shredded and this is Jeff Flake talking about the presumption of innocence you presume he's innocent then you say I Want to further investigation they further investigate your\nColleagues on the left\nWho convinced you\nTo ask for this investigation have thrown you wander the bus you and everybody else in the Republican Party by saying the Republicans don't care about a good investigation you yourself said and so did Susan Collins it seems like a thorough investigation of these accusations\nAnd yet your colleagues as you call them your friends on the left continue to ramp up the rhetoric and make the shrill\nPlease and call this an unfair investigation so they're basically calling you and Susan Collins liars I've I Will take the heat for the people that I respect and admire I mean I Will stand by my feelings I like Jeff Flake\nI think Jeff Flake has a his eyes on a run for the White House I think that some of the things that he is doing now are because that's the road he wants to travel and he he believes he's going to unify the country in a way where if you think about while this process was going on we passed that um that new agreement\nWith Mexico and Canada\nAnd the MCAA agreement the new NAFTA and Jeff Flake along with Senator Kyl put out a joint statement\nTalking about what a great thing to what a great accomplishment this was for the country and for the president so he has been complimentary when necessary when when he believes was proven to the president but he's also been very very critical\nHe's responsible for the prolonging of this process I think that maybe the senator could go a lot further by saying now I turn this over to my democratic colleagues\nIt was time for them to put the partisan politics to bed I stuck my neck out politically even though he's not running again in his life is going to be hell until he leaves\nOffice I stuck my political neck out to try to get the process better and bring us together now where are my friends on the left trying to do the same thing and they aren't not one Democrat said\nSenator Flake cross the aisle and got us to do that got this done if there is no new evidence that shown here I Will cross the aisle and vote yes\nEvery one of those no votes state or no vote every single one as a matter of fact or even complaining more everything they got along the way they got what they were asking for they got the testimony by the doctor in the timeframe they wanted not the committee wanted\nThey got the investigation they asked for that wasn't good enough for her she needs to testify then we need to investigate now the investigation is not good enough\nOver and over and over again never be satisfied\nSo fifty one forty nine will it end that way tomorrow at some time around two o'clock our time is when we find out\nHow the media has been responding to this what they've been saying Mika Brzezinski as as cruel is I think I've ever heard her with things all\nOf that we're still left to talk about this with this Brett Kavanaugh's nomination and the final vote coming tomorrow afternoon at some point we'll talk about some of the things that may influence what time that boat happens one of them would be the attendance of one prominent Republican necessary\nRepublican vote will get to all that coming up at nine twenty you know bear arms firearms is located in the heart of Scottsdale the south east corner of Scottsdale wrote in shape boulevard there celebrating their anniversary week coming up\nSo next week take twenty percent off all use firearms ten percent off everything else in the store ten percent off they're

[laughter]\nMm\n\n\nThanks for being here it's like ... show my name is Mike broom had the media\n[noise] and I cannot let's start with this Samuel Morse at the Baltimore Sun [laughter]\nSo if one vote word to flip let's say they get to Joe Manchin Joe Manchin says you know what I Need to vote along party lines what happens if Susan Collins caves into the pressure\nOf a of the feminist to say how dare you vote against your gender and she may be boats no flake says he's not he just said it unless something drastic happens and you can't possibly see that happening he's going to remain a yes vote but if one person\nFlipped their vote it's fifty fifty\nThe least Fifteen Years that's true that will come in you know no surprise is it is an interesting let me float this out there for anybody that's kind of political walking knows that grant which was a very very very well known political figure in Arizona Twenty years ago yeah\nNot so much now mountains the valleys and that's how the ... knock on him he just hasn't been in the political world in a long time insiders knowing very well um you stayed involved if if David Garcia were to somehow when the governor's race\nAnd Jon Kyl said he's leaving in January that means David Garcia must appoint the next senator yes according to our laws has\nTo appoint a Republican because the Republicans in that office which Republican you think he would nominate he would appoint yep I'm just saying um my guess is if Garcia pulled off the upset about sets Jon Kyl stays until twenty twenty [laughter]\nYeah just the gas no this is the gas oh
