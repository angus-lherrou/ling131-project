we're looking forward to having a conversation with the governor about all things Arizona what's happening here around the state house majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to introduce a bill\nThat would fully fund the wall at the southern border and we talked yesterday about the expense of what's happening a new study shows that we ... we are spending more money\nOn caring for the children of illegal aliens that are born here then we would if we build the wall now one does not necessarily offset the other there is there should be a real conversation that will not be had this year and it will not be had this year because the Democrats will not give the president of victory or the Republican\nThe victory it's just part of American politics what had happened if it were the other way around very possibly\nBut it there's no changing how it is there needs to be a real conversation about border security there are four times or three times more four times more families\nCrossing the border in August of this year than August of last year the drug cartels are very aware of the loop holes in our laws the loopholes in our laws and now\nThe fact that families get kids can only be detained for twenty days that kid people are now crossing the border in droves and instead of being held being detained they are being rapidly dismissed they're given ankle bracelets or some other form of surveillance and just sent out into the streets one of the major concerns\nFor people here in Arizona addressed by Jon Kyl our Senator Jon Kyl was asking the homeland security or yeah the homeland security secretary asking what are we going to do\nAbout this because many of these people in the human sector\nJust being turned out to the streets of Yuma now these are homeless people these are people without a country so to speak they are not being kicked out of America but they're really not here legally it's hard for them to find a way to work they don't have work permits so how do they live while they're waiting for hearings\nSometimes hearing dates are scheduled two years down the road homeless shelters churches people in the community are trying to house people they're not able to take them in for those lengths of time and it's because of loopholes in our laws Congress will do nothing about this it is absolutely without a doubt humanitarian\nAnd again this shows you that the drug cartels\nCare nothing about these people it is about the money they can make bringing them here and throwing them to the wolves so what may have been designed as some kind of a humanitarian\nEffort or humanitarian law in what we do with people or how we keep people\nAnd give them an opportunity here has turned into just the opposite of what they wanted it to be there are mechanisms in place in ... in country south of the border where people can apply for asylum\nThey should not be coming here this way so a bill being put forward by Kevin McCarthy would spend twenty three point four billion dollars\nAnd um this bill is in the drafting process was expected to be released within the next few days\nHouse remains in recess until mid November after that by the way tomorrow we're going to have a congressman Schweikert back in Studio with us and we'll talk with congressman Schweikert about this very bill\nAbout these things see every time we hear about bipartisanship it's because the Democrats are upset that they're in the minority but when it comes time for bipartisanship when there was a reasonable thing brought forward like\nThis\nNo one wants to talk about it no one wants to address it no one wants to be a part of it they know what's the right thing to do border security is national security there is a huge national security element to this but at the same time that they talk about humanitarian behavior this is a humanitarian thing as well\nYou've got families and unaccompanied minors crossing the border with nowhere to go\nThey're applying for asylum because of loopholes in the laws now they're only allowed to be held for twenty days because these places are now being overwhelmed because they've been told they can only hold you for twenty days and they can't kick you out you're applying for asylum which means you're going to be held for less than three weeks\nIn a facility they're gonna give you an ankle bracelet and then they're going to turn you lose then you can go and do what you want to do\nLook at how many people are staying living in the shadows how many millions of people there was almost three hundred thousand babies born to illegal aliens and twenty fourteen in America\nIm school next for seven o'clock march every five fifty ...\nFirst opinion and he was talking five fifty KFYI [laughter]\n[noise]\nAnd I

about all things Arizona so hope you can stick around for that\n[noise] uh the city of San Francisco is I'm falling to pieces it's one of the most beautiful places in the country if you've never been to San Francisco it's it's a fun city it's a great place but the infrastructure of that city and the politics of that city are destroying it from the inside out\nUm pictures of some of the most filled the streets in America or in San Francisco and when I say filthy I'm Talking about a drug needles on the sidewalks human waste on the sidewalks they've got a cruise of people that every afternoon are dispatched to clean up the human and animal waste on the streets a hazmat\nGear because of the needles used\nNeedles laying around it's because of their policies of sanctuary city policies with homeless people it it's it's destructive one of the ways they're able to do it is with this mentality of of uh this I'm\nNot the not individuality they're not left to stand on their own two feet subsidies from the federal government federal programs it's it's really destroying\nWho they are as a city it's terrible but going beyond some of the very serious issues to show you how ingrained some of this idiotic behavior is\nThe San Francisco school board president or his name is Steven Cook it is pretty standard for\nGovernmental meetings to begin with the reciting the pledge of allegiance we had Newt Gingrich in town phrase he talks about we open easy talks with the pledge of allegiance we all stand and we pledge allegiance it is a it is ceremonial is symbolic but it's also an American tradition someone governmental meetings that happens\nIt everyone I've ever seen they start with the pledge of allegiance will Steven Cook decided that the San Francisco school board needs to be different they need to be unique they need to be um\nA separate so instead of\nThe pledge of allegiance Steven Cook recited a quote from Maya Angelou [laughter] or when you learn Cheech when you get give cook told the chronicle he chose not to enforce the pledge because of his disappointment with the political climate he said the Trump Administration has been attacking our liberties\nHow exactly has the Trump Administration than attacking people's liberties I decided I really would love to hear\nIf the Trump Administration has done anything it's give people their liberties and the way they've been doing it is to make sure that you can stand on your own two feet\nHe told the chronicle\nThe pledge of allegiance law required by state education code is rarely enforced by school district officials one of the spokesman said it's not required for school boards have us ten Americans who wrote it or when it was implemented or ... or why it is or how we started our meetings a lot of us be hard pressed to answer so there are a lot of ways to express gratitude\n[noise] a lot of ways to express gratitude ... and a appreciation for the country and its citizens this is how I plan to do that so he read a quote from Maya Angelou [noise]\nJust after seven o'clock Eric Holder and civility in American politics what he believe should be done your chance to win a thousand dollars just by taxing

sent a formal comment to the FCC asking them to create new rules to try to fight these scammers by allowing telephone companies to block more illegal calls\nRobo callers they say are using what's called neighbors scanning this is the way they work around call blocking so the recipient sees a fake caller i._d. on their phone with a number that looks like it's someone from their area\nLast year the Federal Trade commission received four and a half million illegal robocall complaints at least in the NBC News radio\nFour and a half million robocall complaint wow already wrecked by devastating floods from Hurricane Florence the Carolinas are now waiting for the remnants of hurricane Michael\nWe're not quite done yet we couldn't see additional damage say not so much from the when they're down to about fifty miles per hour we've had some gusts near Charleston about fifty to fifty five there's isolated power outages cause of that but that's not going to be the big issue it's going to be

the state of American politics\nSo you want bipartisan effort you want this you want that isn't it funny how when the Republicans want to win all they care about is power when the Republicans want to win it's just power hungry people when you when it's so that you can take power from the powerful and speak truth to power\nIs that not the most ironic statement you've ever heard there is no more there is no better picture of uh\nOur hungry person than Hillary Clinton there is no better picture look when she did in the presidential primary for the Democrats\nHillary Clinton rigged the entire thing she bought and paid for the Democratic party during the primary she financed the Democratic primary why do you think everybody\nIncluding Debbie Wasserman Schultz lost their jobs and the DNC\nAnd yet she's going to lecture the country on power hungry people\nIt's it's amazing it's\nAbsolutely amazing you want to know why they hate Donald Trump so much is because he didn't care about the power he was already powerful he was already a billionaire he already had more than any of them will ever have\nOr most of them will ever have\nAnd so when he didn't care what they had to say he didn't cower to what they wanted now he's called the leader of the power hungry world to say anything to do anything group go back and look what the Democrats have said about Republicans in the Trump family that was what used to be off limits\nFor the first family used to be off limits not anymore both barrels whatever it takes whatever it takes\nPresident Trump\nGets himself in a bunch of trouble because in the wake of the hurricane that devastated the panhandle of Florida Panama City looks like a war zone or in the wake of all of that the president dared to go to a political rally so what he had to say about this that of course the media's reaction to all of it that's all coming up at seven twenty\nCarol Royce Kelly Williams ... east valley if you were going to sell your home anytime soon

getting a pretty cool reception to all of it\nIt there's a real difference in this campaign I mean he stated his positions he wants to\nDouble income tax he wants to remove the national guard from the border roll back public safety regulations abolish ice what we want to do is continue the momentum that we have here we have a growing economy way of proving education system we want to prioritize these twenty percent pay increases for our teachers\nAnd we want to Arizona to continue to go in the right direction I think my opponent would like to make it a carbon copy of California\nI say that

business ideas of how in the economy grow\nBullets night and day this administration of course we tried to work with the last administration it was a very limited they had very little use for governors I think Rocco Obama wanted everything in Washington DC kind of top down one size fits all Obama cares the best example of that\nThis administration is dramatically different one Donald Trump as a businessman a number\nTwo I knew Mike Pence before I was a governor and they think that government closer to the people is better government so our economy was growing before the administration came in\nBut to go in and build a fulfilling career as well or I\nCompletely off political topics for sure because I Know that you serve the community for a long time as a Thunderbird I just sat down

some time talking with the governor about partisan politics at about issues and I think one of the things that most people agree on the politicians are going to fight it out the way they do my problem isn't so much with the politicians they are going to do that's their job to do those things my problem is with the media my problem is with cable news\nThe traditional media and the way they try to posed themselves or prop themselves up as a nonpartisan group and they just absolutely are not any more there is no um there's just no give people the facts\nEntity left I don't believe and so when you see a Joe Scarborough get up in the Morning Joe and and accused in a way we've got questions\nHere's after nine eleven and ah it was the lawyer she brought a lawyer into town [laughter]\nAnd that was the lawyer for the blind Sheikh [laughter]\nThe blind Sheikh yes the terrorists the blind Sheikh good it's not just a disorder because lawyers have to represent people all the time they have to do their job but this particular lawyer was thrown in prison because of of of a passing notes and and doing things illegally to help the blind Sheikh\nSo in a two separate events the first event the lawyer ... said the lawyer was emphatically not guilty and would not have been charged with a crime but they weren't for the hastily enacted Patriot Act\nUm she and said that prior to September eleventh the hastily enacted Patriot Act Lynn Stewart never would have been indicted at all\nThis was from ... in cinema I'm so last April FBI agents arrested store to Brooklyn home and they took her away in handcuffs her crime [laughter] doing her job for the past twenty seven years is an outspoken criminal defense lawyer those are ... cinemas words about this attorney\n\nThe second event when this lawyer came out was just days after the first her description of Stewart was not particularly accurate two years after the events in Arizona Stewart was convicted of aiding the blind Sheikh in passing secret messages to us designated terror group\nThe Islamic group\nShe was initially sentenced to twenty eight months but in twenty ten she was ... sentenced to ten years behind bars\nThe federal judge also said the steward committed perjury and lack of remorse for her say after her first sentencing the lawyer was eventually released in twenty Thirteen due to her medical condition she died in twenty Seventeen\nSo Stewart helped the blind Sheikh between Ninety seven and ... to to pass the instructions to terror groups followers\nThe blind Sheikh relied on Stewart and to other people to withdraw his group support for a ceasefire with the Egyptian government after it's Ninety seven terror attack which killed sixty two people\nThe cinema campaign said it's a Fox News in a follow up
