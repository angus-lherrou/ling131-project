inconceivable to many\nWe are seeing wages on the rise we are seeing consumer confidence at from the bottom up the highest amount of\nConsumer confidence right now in America are the lowest income earners they're earning more money than they ever have before in many cases they're starting to see their wages go up their options for jobs are going up there are getting better benefits because companies want to hold onto them you're seeing every sector see job growth and potential\nEven people without high school diplomas\nGetting jobs convicted felons getting jobs this is great news wages are on the rise us wages have grown and a Seventeen month high I mean that is really good news\nCompanies are stronger they have more money in their coffers they're offering better benefits and they're paying more money employees are seeing more money the tax cuts of help the lowest income earners doubling up you know when you take a family that's making\n'em you know fifty sixty thousand dollars a year and you double their standard deduction\nThat's huge and\nThat's what we've done with the tax code allowing people to keep more of the money they earned and so why are we\nWhy are we not applauding the economy in the U.S well there's a ... it's a political year it's an election year and the left doesn't want to give any victories because it it hampers their chances of taking over the house in the Senate so they come up with um they complain about things on the left\nThat they never complain about until Republicans are in control and I'll be honest with you there right it's unfortunate but they're right\nBut there are complaints are disingenuous so here's the complaint we're still creating huge deficits over a trillion dollars added to the deficits again\nWell that's unacceptable let me ask you a question do you believe in your heart of hearts do you believe if the Democrats take over the house in the Senate that they are going to do anything to reduce deficits\n\nDo you believe that a Democrat controlled house or Senate or both Congress will reduce the deficits\nThe answer is absolutely not the national debt doubled under Brock Obama doubled so now they're complaining about that I don't blame them I'm complaining about it\nThe fact that we ... we collected record revenue in twenty eight team the fiscal year\nWhich is really sad because the tax cuts that exactly what the president said it was going to do it was going to drive up income into the treasury we're still seeing record revenue into the treasury\nIn spite of tax cuts what we're not seeing is spending reductions the president\nHas a very aggressive plan to beef up and bolster our military which is absolutely necessary in a very dangerous world but we are not making spending cuts anywhere else they've shown the tax cuts increase revenue um they should cut taxes again they should put this economy ... on in fast forward\nMode will they I don't know\nBut we do know that we have a spending problem not an income problem in the United states\nSo on one hand you're seeing wages driving up because companies have more of their own money they're buying new equipment they're expanding

White House was one of them\nBut now asking White House are you satisfied with the scope of the investigation here's his answer\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know\nAll the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given a free rein to interview wherever they want\nAnd that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yeah but I think they probably shouldn't be able to get this done by friday affair and really put the effort into it\nAnd I think that they're going to be done today or tomorrow but now you've got listening to Blumenthal here's the same boat Blumenthal was the other one that walked out a Blumenthal walked so Blumenthal Blumenthal now he's making
