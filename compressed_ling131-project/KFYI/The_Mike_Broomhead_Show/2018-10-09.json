hearings this situation could have been addressed\nDianne Feinstein could have taken that redacted letter could have given it to Chuck Grassley the head of that committee they could've convened to hearing about this\nThey could have brought in FBI investigators they could have brought in Dr Ford they could've brought in judge Kavanaugh and address this specifically they could have handled it

president making comments which are not public yet they will ... will bring those to you as soon as they are being made public from the pool reporters\nWhat we're getting from the pool feed the

UN ambassador\nSo they're giving the president some time to name another one I have no idea who those candidates might be but that is a breaking news this morning Nikki Haley will be leaving as UN ambassador at the end of this year so we'll get you up to date we'll let you hear from the president as soon as we have released some of that some of that information or some of those um\nComments have been released [noise] Jackson, Mississippi\nThe forest so high school halftime banned performance if you've not heard about this it's called Brookhaven high school it's gone viral on social media this is one of those questions I have a lot of educators\nAnd it it's it's adults in general have you ever been around adults and and seen kids doing something or go out in public and seemed like a teenager wearing something and wondering you're with your parents and how did your parents let you do that\nYou know they're wearing some kind of a shirt with a vulgar saying whatever just you just wonder what were they thinking right\nUm\nThis one I Wonder what the band director and how the band director has\nKept his or her job um the performance at halftime depict students dressed as doctors and nurses\nHolding SWAT Team members at gunpoint\n\nNow two weeks ago or I'm Sorry a week to go\nTo Brookhaven police officers were killed in the line of duty responding to his shots fired coal\n\nJackson public school superintendent Dr Eric Green released a statement saying I'll be happy with a jak to public school system I want to offer my deep and sincere apologies from the form of the forest do high school band during friday's football game\nOr the halftime show in Brookhaven\nBased loosely on the movie John cue the bans performance depicts a hostage scene that included toy guns\nGPS has a great deal of respect\nAnd appreciation for our law enforcement partners the bands performance does not depict the values of the people in our community and was incredibly insensitive to the students' families law enforcement officials in the entire Brookhaven community\nFor this we sincerely apologize to all\nAnd we pledge to do better in the future we have taken some initial actions in response to this matter and you have my commitment that we will investigate it fully and take additional appropriate action with respect to procedures and\nPersonnel so the mayor of Brookhaven since\nHas spoken to the mayor of Jackson when formed him to the forest hill band director has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation he added that the major apology or the mayor apologize for to him personally for the halftime show\n\nI just wonder how cool in the world in the adult community at that high school I thought this was a good idea\nI mean I understand as teenagers you push the limits and you do stupid things I mean they kids do stupid things\n\nBut you know I could picture of Noah Carvel is going for something like this and the west valley he's a band the teacher in the west valley one of our red red leaders you know when you are when I look at when you think about it this young person\nWith anti you know a stab measurement ideas and that's with no ... no is it a huge anti establishment person\nBut here you've got to high school\nWhere if you think about the gun free zones that high schools are\nWould happen if any one of those kids brought one of those toy guns to school in a bag they'd expel the kids\nBut at halftime let's have I'm dressed up like doctors and nurses holding cops at gunpoint as long as you're pointing a gun at a cop now it's a political statement and it's allowed that seem odd all of my law enforcement friends out there is an odd\nThat guns are a horrible thing and if a kid draws a picture of a gun on a book it's a gun crime if a kid bites a a a pop tart will be called a glock ... in the shape of a gun and holds it up it's a gun crime\nBut as long as you've got a halftime show at a high school where your depicting people holding the cops at gunpoint it now becomes a legitimate political statement\n\nThat it's really incredibly fascinating to me coming up just after eight o'clock we'll let you hear Nancy Pelosi and she reveals what's called a rat\nBumps me or the Senate and twenty Seventeen and accusing Republicans of doing it but it sounds exactly like what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd we'll have more information on the resignation of Nikki Haley as the UN ambassador all of that coming up just after eight your chance to tax they didn't win one thousand dollars in just a moment or to stick around just for listening you could win a thousand bucks hope you do\n[noise]\nFought for US ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley resigning from that role Haley\nLeft her job as governor

Brett Kavanaugh on the job today hearing his first round of arguments as an associate Supreme Court justice he was sworn in on Saturday but again last night at the White House if you're making a

do you think it was a Republican on the committee that released her name\nThe answer is no it was not it was either a coordinated effort along with her permission behind the scenes or it was done to her by Dianne Feinstein or some of the other Democrats that saw this opening as an opportunity more important than protecting her anonymity either way if you are a ... Ford\nSupporter her name became public she had to face public scrutiny\nAnd death threats and everything else because Dianne Feinstein office allowed that information to be leaked are you upset with the Democrats no you're not because your rage only is limited to your political partisan beliefs\n\n... anonymity could have been protected for sure and Dr I'm Sorry and judge Kavanaugh's reputation as well in closed door hearings but it wasn't below sea describes perfectly describes perfectly\nWhat happened what we'll do what eight twenty\nDavid Garcia candidate for governor has another big issue with somebody involved with this campaign this one right along the same lines of what Brett Kavanaugh was accused of all of that coming up here at eight twenty\nYou know London mortgage has been in business here in Arizona for quite a long time in two generations as a matter of fact\nAnd if you're looking to buy which everyone should be right now we all know rent is extremely high it's tough to find a good rental property rent is through the roof right now\nBuying a home is going to help you gain equity from the day you move in because home prices are continuing to increase\nBefore rates go up any higher you can get it on the ground floor of that at lower interest rate that's\nWhat London mortgage is going to help you do but if you are to finish and complete that mortgage whether it's a new purchase or refinance of an existing mortgage\nBefore the end of this year they will reimburse you five hundred dollars a viewer appraisal cost it's called the London refund it's one reason to get busy right now get pre qualified in October so that you can get this mortgage closed before the end of the year\nTake advantage of the lung to refund and start homeownership the London mortgage team dot com then called six to three eight seven five Ninety nine forty six to three eight seven five Ninety nine forty [noise]\nKeep trailer Adrian ... east side west side traffic well things are clearing up a little bit but we still have stuff and go traffic the mountains in Mesa too old to west from from Dobson over to Scottsdale road and we have an accent at all for\nI drove to was founded on the red ... for us six figures ... on a cell phone was vice safely over ... over the eyes yeah surfer ...\nVaccine right now I'm ...

articulate I think she takes the stance of America First in the right way in that body I think she'd been critical of our enemies I think she strengthen our allies\nI mean she is a brilliant foreign policy person she is a diplomat and I think it's going to be hard to replace her as I said earlier in the day\nI Believe she is to the Trump Administration as ... rice was\nTo the George W.
