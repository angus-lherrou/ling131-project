wrong\nThere is I I've mentioned the oath TMZ other than Mexicans go and look at a list\nOf OPM just captured at the southern border the United states so it's not just people from Mexico coming north there are communist Chinese every Middle Eastern North African country from from Russia from Cuba from all over the world\nAnd they're coming through Mexico because it is a porous part of the border so when\nYou hear these accusations by the president when he said they're MS Thirteen gang members you noticed there not arguing that\nI just want you to notice that when the president said MS Thirteen gang members middle Easterners infiltrating this caravan nobody is saying how dairy there's no there's no MS Thirteen gang members in there have you noticed that nobody in the media and none of the left wing politicians are denying that claim\nThat is\nHis absurd we know that this caravan is not seven thousand people a entitled to refugee status and be coming here just for a better life in America to escape a war torn country you were there are bad people in this caravan\nHow do we separate them out\nAnd why aren't these other nations who have borders in laws themselves\nHow are they not required to stop these people as they traverse their country you don't think if it was the other way around they would want the people to stop these things on the U.S side of the border before it got to Mexico of course they would of course they would and it's just not happening\nSo the president's comments once again are taken 'em and made these big political statements the show he's a racist and and and and the hard part about all this is he's going to be very right about most of this there is MS Thirteen gang members in that I'm confident of it have I seen them no\nBut we know how they

often use on five Fifteen KFYI [noise]\nYou know it's\nInteresting we've got these midterm elections right around the corner of important races in the house important\nRaces in the Senate local races are just as important here um you know the the gubernatorial race I think we're looking at almost a case study if you're a political science major in college the way these campaigns are being run in Arizona is fascinating looking at the demographics and trying to win gone are the days where you just lay out a case for who you are\nAnd what you want and let the chips fall where they may I understand the desire to when I really do but winning under false pretenses it's like getting into a relationship with somebody and pretending to be somebody or not\nYou know you like somebody you're going to date somebody and you want them to like you so you pretend to get to like the things they like will sooner or later they figure out you don't like the same things they do you're not gonna be able to keep up the facade forever\nYou know David Garcia is telling you who he is there's just no way around that David Garcia is telling you who he is and for that much I I'll give him credit you know he is a veteran I respect to service a great deal of but he's wrong on so many issues in what most Arizona's believe\nHe's wrong on abortion and it's not just being pro choice it saying that a Thirteen year old girl should be able to to have an abortion without parental consent that's a parental issue when no matter what it is a Thirteen year old has no right to do anything without parental consent they can't take an aspirin they can't leave campus they can't do anything they can't get a tattoo\nCan't get a piercing I don't believe without a parent and yet\nYou're going to let them do something not only a medical procedure and let's just go with that for a moment without the what I Believe it it truly is just go to medical procedure part of it you're gonna let her undergoing medical procedure\nNot only that if she's pregnant we all know what causes that and if she's doing this at Thirteen Years old the parents have a right to intervene and find out who this is where is she said\nIt's just wrong it's just not the way most people in Arizona a deal with things um you know the governor of Arizona is traveling around he'd been open about ... who he is and what he wants the same thing with Martha ... she's been telling everybody who she is you know her military career\n[noise] she was she ... her fellowship under Senator Jon Kyl I mean again you're you're foray into politics and war starts in the house of representatives which she did a good job she voted with the president over Ninety percent of the time which cures in cinema tries to use against her\nHere since then and now he's trying to pretend she believes that she has an opportunity to win this race if she can convince people in Arizona that she does not care at all about political parties and it is truly absurd to believe that\nI mean just look at the history of who she is she is not telling the truth she is telling you what you want to hear\nAnd she believes that's the way she's going to win let's say she does win how well it's a scary thought and I don't think she's going to but if ... cinema is able to morph into something she's not long enough to win an election what happens when it comes time to vote now she's going to be there for six years if she wins this election", "show_name": "The Mike Broomhead Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "23"}
