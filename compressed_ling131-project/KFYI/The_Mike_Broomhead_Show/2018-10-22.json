countries like Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador couldn't prevent their citizens from heading towards America the U.S government will cut off or substantially reduce foreign aid to those countries\nA second caravan of one thousand people is working to link up with the main group homeland security is focused on rooting out potential criminals gang members and the caravan\nGreg Paul five fifty KFYI I knew that you\nGreg brunette talking more about this coming up\nAbout eight or two this morning deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein scheduled to talk with some members of two house committee this

Labor Statistics annual consumer expenditure survey is saying this second Seattle third San Francisco and then Boston in Anchorage trend up top five\nThis guy onto spewing agenda that's what he did he brought this person on to view this agenda\nWe live in a border state we love the state of Arizona this is happening from a cow in Texas all the way to the border crossing in California we're seeing this across the board it is not right\nThe problems that we are seeing that are being caused by this need to be stopped we should secure our border so we know who's coming and who's going we should make it easier for good people to come I Am in favor as long as we got over seven million jobs open\nMany of them in the construction world we should be doing a two pronged approach number one we should be advancing and building and encouraging kids to go into trade schools\nIf these kids are not going to go to college go to a trade school get a specific skill make a very good living whether it's the trades classically that I talked about where I was electrician air conditioner plumber ... any of those trades carpenter\nBut in the meantime why are we not allowing skilled labor from other countries to come here on a visa we can track them if we want to that's what ISIS supposed to do track visas\nSo which should be a two pronged approach train up the next generation of people doing those jobs and bring qualified labor here and allow them to be here and follow the rules pay taxes and go home when they want to\n\nWe've got to get a handle on the border we should make it easier for good people to immigrate to this country they should be able to come here legally we talk about family separation at the border go talk to a legal immigrant asked them about family separation asked\nThem how far there how long their families were left behind when they came to this country legally and did it the right way how proud they ought to call themselves an American citizen now because they earn it\nCome here on a visa get a green card pathway time money good behavior passing tests to become a citizen then bringing your children here the separation for families years\nAnd yet we talk about the separation of families when they come here illegally this is a political football that nobody on the right Israeli answering correctly nobody in the Republican Party is talking about the human aspect of this talking about the legal immigrants and the way illegal immigrants are leading the charge against illegal immigration\nBecause legal immigrants feel it's a slap in their face\nIt's a slap in their face because they've done it the right way they paid a hefty price with years in dollars\nAnd they're watching people storm across the border heroes to some in the Democratic party and demanding things that someone else had to earn that makes no sense\n\nAnd I'm not I'm not a racist I'm not as you know folks um none of those things I'm practical\nPeople should be able to come to America but they have to do it the right way and when you're a caravan seven thousand strong proud of the fact that you were going to do it illegally you should be stopped to be taught to lessen the lessons should be you cannot do it against the rules\nAnd the Democrats used to say that but they don't anymore because of political expediency it's insane\nEight twenty we talk
