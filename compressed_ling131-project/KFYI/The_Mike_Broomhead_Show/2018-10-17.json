talking with someone on on Twitter recently matter of fact this morning who said they they just think that the political process right now it's gotten out of hand and everybody should quit voting\nAnd I said I think the opposite should happen I think it should be a new batch of voters on both sides of the aisle if you want to replace the elected you've got to replace the electorate and so it's weird that Congress's approval rating is somewhere around fourteen percent\nAnd yet they have like a Ninety percent reelection rate or whatever it is so everybody seems to be okay with their member but not the body\nAnd so I you know there's got to be a shift somewhere but if you're new to the process um let me introduce you to cure in cinema\n[noise] I'm curious than cinema um has been a

of the investigation when they were looking at the upper echelon manager or the FBI and what they found was this\nYou're official took a sporting event tickets so we don't know really what they are what sporting events they were members of the media were buying influence or at least it appears that way with members of the FBI and this was FBI management a big senior official\nAnd uh what is really interesting about this is my relationship as I've gotten to know some former members of the FBI very well then I Would consider them friends\nOf between them about fifty years experience with the FBI the retired now there is such a fraternity among the FBI alumni they are they are still very engaged and very concerned about the reputation of the agency they take their careers\nProudly you know they could have gone on to make a lot a lot more money doing other things these are very smart\nA you've got to be gifted physically you have to be gifted a mentally you have to be gifted um emotionally in order to do this job it's it's a job that takes up everything and so when you have someone that has all of those things they are very desirable and any market and these are people who have chosen chosen to serve their country\nSo they consider the fraternity or the FBI to be one they want to keep the integrity in intact\nSo with the firing of James Comey and Andrew McCabe Peter stroke\nThey the reputation of the FBI is taken a hit now these were upper echelon ... isolated incidents for sure but there were other officials that we're getting too chummy with members of the media they were taking gifts from members of the media which you're not supposed to know are you allowed to do\nAnd um that's why this person retired and but isn't being recommended for criminal charges\nBut there is a danger here\nAnd every person I've talked to in law enforcement it it it just kind of makes them shake their heads and so what do you what are you thinking because you know you are you're getting chummy with people you're not supposed to be getting chummy with and you're going to end up getting yourself in a bunch of trouble\nAnd in this case um ah the investigation that this investigation with this person was found out the same investigations led to the firing of everybody I just listed before\nIsn't it fascinating that they're cleaning house at the FBI and yet they're maintaining a or there are people are trying to maintain\nThat there's an investigation the integrity of which is still pure well I don't believe that Robert Mueller is supposed to be
