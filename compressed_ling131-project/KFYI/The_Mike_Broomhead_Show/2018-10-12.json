will\nWill the blue wave occur are we going to see the the Democrats take over the house we don't know we're going to look at some of the polling numbers but in\nThe Senate it looks like the Republicans actually have an opportunity to gain seats one of the things obviously the bomb show I've been talking about here since ... when she began running I've known here's in cinema\nSince she was in the Arizona State legislature and what she's been portraying herself to be she is not the video that came out last night from twenty eleven shows you who care since cinema really is how much would that affect this race\nNational press secretary for the RMC catchy medley joined us catchy welcome back to the show or what does this video due to this race here in Arizona\nWhile at you know and it's a razor thin race anyway and anytime you've that critics instead of my in her own words showing her truth south which is a far different picture than she likes the painting her political ad that are carefully choreographed movements and Congress\nAre is bad news for her um and I think mark and selling it to keep going out running a campaign she's writing and I think she'll have a lot of except on November ... because\nCritics into them as being a kitchen to them as being added for again the woman that she has a thorny plays a moderate but she really has put extremist points of view and she's ... she's happy to divide them\nFor a couple of things happening and I'm sure you're ... I Know you're not watching every single race all the time in Arizona but there was another a Democrat in the house races they used to be the Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton\nAnd her him and cures to basically running the same game in which they show themselves to be very moderate willing to and wanting to reach across the aisle and work with Republicans and it's really the only chance they have to win whereas our government our race for governor David Garcia is telling everybody exactly who used as far left as he is\nAnd there's not much difference between the three but he's down about Seventeen point so I don't think they had any choice but to run this race but it looks like they're being exposed now\nWhile it's an interesting playbook and if they think that they're only proud that I think that tells you your answer Arizona and want a strong conservative representing them\nAnd here's what here's the reality and we know that that's actually a playbook across the country I don't know if you saw a felt better than his running for Senate in Tennessee he was shut out and buy his campaign staff they know he doesn't really support cabinet and he just had to say that publicly that bitter politics but when it gets in there and he'd never vote for him\nAnd I am that's what we're seeing across the country because what we know that you're getting results with Republican and said this whole Democrat and especially the far left Democrat\nDon't play well with voters and uh but it's important I think voters are smarter than that it's important that we see it for what it is and you vote people and who are going to do what they say they're going to do\nAnd then that you got consistency with Martin makes Sally she's got a record that shows that and uh again we're seeing the hypocrisy and the political ploy a kitchen set amount and others\nAre in the national press secretary joining us catches my ... when you look at these races because when it comes down to the ... early voting is being done here in Arizona\nAnd when it comes down to the people that have not decided yet usually those independent minded boulders that don't pay attention to party lines I think being honest with the voters about who you are goes a long way I think Martha ... military career\nOr the trailblazer that she has been for women with her accomplishments of being the first female fighter pilots being the first one of the will to command a squadron I Do think in the end that's going to go a long way with voters in Arizona\nI Hope you're right see that's a rock star candidate and and not just for a Republican although of course I'm very proud to stand at the same side as her in that regard\nBut as a representative for anyone we of course at trust and value our military men and women have someone like her who in every facet of her life she goes all in and she got the job the absolute back to her ability whether that's our military life or what we know of her in Congress that the kind of representative you want to think\nAnd what a great opportunity for Arizona and to have that type of person representing them and and one more thought on that\nYou know speaking a fighter pilot and won't be wind as American as we want our government to work for us and what our government to fight for us and Donald Trump\nTheir works relief only takes ... minutes to apply absorbs

I don't know which is winning because I Can't [laughter] so let me let me ask you about some of the races that are going on in Arizona because\nI've kind of marvel the little bit at the differences it seems as if Greg Stanton and care students cinema have the same campaign person because they have sprint into the middle and try to make themselves look like moderates\nAnd they it's almost like they don't want you to look at their rhetoric that's a traditional campaign is and you know both of them had the benefit of having really no primary\nSo um you know the old days is you tapped you know to the side for your primary and then tried to tack back to the middle\nI'm In ... case and I have not seen as much on the stand and cars and not in that district um it it was the theme because their districts have lots and lots of independence that um if they really\nUnderstood the true base records of many of these candidates they run away and fear well if you look at it because I think the opposite of that is David Garcia who is showing you exactly who you're ... and you did something really brilliant this morning you actually complimented him\nFor telling the truth right I'm doing this and there are a lot of the left political consultants and those I'm giving you some inside baseball they thought the Bernie Sanders um that hard hard to resist left wave was real and try norm is\nA and turns out um you had a number of candidates who are out there running whether it be my opponent are David Garcia who basically adopted hey the abolish ice national health care you know I mean just the fringe of the agenda and they really and then all of a sudden they found out\nIt's a fringe of even their own party right who really is a ... ... and loud but an engaged [noise]\nUm I I'm going to go loud engaged and a true minority because we're even seeing some interesting things in in ... to give you some insight secrets um we did a big pole three weeks ago a month ago\nAnd I was getting thirty percent of Democrats men\n... and when we actually looked into what was happening is a lot of these working folks out there who were very comfortable with the unions they they they wanted their wages they wanted to take care of their families and they actually felt the Democratic party has become so extreme\nThey they're not running out to be Republicans but they are they're moving away from the Democratic party's extremism\nWhen David Garcia says it a public forum during the primaries and a Thirteen year old girl should be able to get an abortion without telling her parents even people that are pro choice look at that and say I can't\nI Can't agree with that even though they are so far away from some of the people that like you said they're not going to become Republicans ... and this is I never want to give advice to a party that's actually\nI'm [laughter] not helping themselves but just as the Republicans decades ago had to deal with um some fringe we had\nUm the Democrats are going to actually have a have to have some on a soul searching of just engaging in sort of the extremism of radical urban liberals becoming the party platform\nI'm that's actually not where the majority of Americans whether you'd be Republican Democrat are they want prosperity they want success they want good things to happen and they don't want government to run every aspect of their lives\nIf in your opinion do the do the Republicans have a good chance a fair chance of holding on to the house\nI'm almost met or some of the day and let's be really honest if it were ten days ago um the generic ballots if you ever go to that real clear politics it's gotten up to like nine point four percent Democrat advantage\nThat was really ugly that yet that means we lose the house today it's in the high sixes if it will take that down about one more point\nWe retain the house so the motion is out there the most important thing is in and look a little while ago you said were twenty five days till the election\nAbsolutely wrong and ... and early voting is already started out the ballots are out when you get home loose this evening there's going to be a ballot in your mailbox fill it out and mail it back understand about forty percent\nOf our brothers and sisters out their get their ballot and they put her on the stack of all that paper on their coffee table and they forget to mail it back\nAnd this is a turnout election if our people if the people that actually sort of see the wonderful things are happening out there in in unemployment in in our wages finally moving up our home values will take those ballots and mail them back this weekend\nA I'll stop calling you [laughter] and I will stop texting you will stop trying to knock on your door will leave you alone because we get a list of who's returned their ballots\nBut it avoids that problem of we get busy in our lives\nI go to the polls so oh you're you're gonna send your now one of maybe twelve Fifteen to twenty percent that's left yeah mathematically for a lot of these races\nThere actually over in ten days yeah it's who will mail those ballots back and um if if we really believe the left bases on fire\nHow do we make sure that the more conservative folks the folks who actually see the prosperity lifting people um in our community\nDo you want to defend it or do you want to have it ripped away from you if you want to defend it get that ballot out of your mailbox and send it back this weekend that's\nA great advice or wherever with congressman Schweikert one more second would the cars to talk to him about the what's happening in the house of representatives if the Republicans were to retain control what would happen in the next year versus if the Democrats would Nancy Pelosi\nThe speaker of the house would there be somebody else and leadership all that coming up and just a few moments you know Carol ... east valley is your valley wide agent Carol Royce just gets it right she promises the sale of your home she guarantee that so if you're looking to buy another home you don't have to worry about two mortgages\nShe will put it in writing she will pick a timeframe and a dollar amount with

you're serious about selling your home\nFor eight zero seven seven six fifty two thirty one that's for eight zero seven seven six fifty two thirty one or the Carol as the buyers dot com that's Carol
