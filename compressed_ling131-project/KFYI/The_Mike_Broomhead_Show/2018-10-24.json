I'm not sure if say a deal breaker for the love of [laughter]\n\nTrump supporters should walk away from the president because he's a liar and oh don't pay attention to what he says you pay attention to what he does but we can't do that as citizens and journalist we must hold that line\nOh but Andrew Gillum against the backdrop of Trump purchased some tickets to his show and I don't think the people are going to care moments later he said it moments later\nNow not to be outdone here\nCan you believe the media is running cover for scandals in elections I mean they did it for Bill Clinton\nAnd they said it was to protect the integrity of the office but it's still shocked that the heck out of me when they do it so blatantly\nAndrew Gillum lied to federal investigators while he was being investigated for corruption and still won the nomination for his party in the midst of an investigation now it's been proven that he lied to federal investigators\nAnd they're running cover for him Allison store Allison Stewart from CNN [noise] now runs even further cover for Andrew Gillum\nBay we all can recognize them and I tell you I Know that it's landfills across the country are filled with auto research that has ever seen the light of day and that's been flushed down the toilet because that was never made it that he wasn't doing as well we wouldn't be talking about it handled it well\nWe wouldn't be talking about these Hamilton tickets if he wasn't doing so well it doesn't change the fact that the mayor of Tallahassee is being investigated for corruption\nOr how many different directions of hypocrisy can I go here\nDoes would you guess that Alice Stewart or John Avalon both of which you just heard were part of the crowd that said we should be holding up judicial nominations by this president while he's being investigated for collusion with the Russians how many people on the left said that\nWe can't put any of these judicial nominations forward until this investigation is finished because he may be removed from office he isn't prepared he isn't qualified he should step away the twenty Fifth Amendment the impeachment whatever it is they've all been a part of that echo chamber\n[noise] you've got a guy being actively investigated by the feds and you make him the nominee of your party then when it turns out he lied to the feds\nIn one breath ... Trump is allying liar and his supporters are hypocrites an idiot but you're going to run cover for Andrew Gillum then you're going to say well the only reason why the Republicans are talking about this because Gillum doing so well\nEven if that were the case hey you're not talking about it that's the problem the problem that you're not criticizing exist that you've got someone being credit criminally investigated while a candidate for governor and now at least one of these charges he's been proven to be a liar on\nAnd you're still defending him is a huge issue number one\nNumber two you are hypocrites cause you go after Trump every chance you get\nI mean the\nThe death of the hypocrisy\nWhether it's the cover you ran for Bill Clinton and the cover you're running for Andrew Gillum but trying to destroy this president whether it's that or whether it's just in one breath you say everybody should be held accountable and are we should expect our leaders to tell the truth and then you pull this\nIt's it's really is laughable\n[noise] the president calls himself a nationalist and when he calls himself a nationalist there is a collective explosion\nOver at CNN I guess I shouldn't say that this morning after the device that was sent there I mean it that way there was a collective screen that came from the people at CNN we're going to let you hear what they're saying it's CNN and MSNBC about the fact that Trump called himself a nationalist that happens at nine twenty\nYou know our J.
