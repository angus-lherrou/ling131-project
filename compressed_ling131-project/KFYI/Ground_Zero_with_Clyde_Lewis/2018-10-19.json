who is the\nProbably the most intelligent program or we have no it was the power of means symbols numbers and coats\n\nAnd this is why tonight the argument that we're making Chris geometry geo her on the program Dr ... the argument we're making is that we live in a matrix\nAnd the reason why is because in PCs non playing characters are easily programmed organics the ones that are ... they use a but I'd say critical analysis of the ones that will not be programs and they are the ones that are going to try and pull us out of whatever\nIt is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online magic Chris geo will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media\nI'm putting out a program in the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up and he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw was the dissolve meant of the ... agenda\n'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against Kanye that I Will not repeat on this broadband via word but it\nIt go ... yes ... to show how this script all of sudden changed what it All right\nHave you ... did you see the the the there was a tropical was being blocked in Portland the anti five members were blocking and directing traffic world guy pulls up in a car\nAnd some guy who was holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group and he started yelling at the guy goes you look like Whitey I bet you're a Whitey Archie says to I'm going to go in this guy's a white guy calling another guy all Whitey same with what happened with ... we have a a a black faceless and PC\nOn uh CNN calling Kanye n n word that can read is what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happened is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with\nSo um you were talking about numbers and number ... symbolism and numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to mom\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge I just want to\nOut that parents and they can actually called me and this is the point is like not in Nineteen Ninety this is\nTen Twenty years before this time that we're in right now it's called the mean\nThe smallest unit of an idea that still has coherent see and what a genius to biology I mean it's to ideology and so you need a lawn chair mean boldly and see it\nThat will replicate Jess like jeans replicate and in fact I'm moving to the organism that society and breeding as I Do that society operates I kind of biological economy and I believe these names are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with with an PCs I I guess\nI have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means it's that it doesn't make any sense to in order to send them in some way whereas the organics are full of standing on constantly creating these means and they really do change our society and drastic wage very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical terms of people are more familiar with like ... there's a ... a mind form that is that when you manifested becomes an ... which is of course another a cult concept which is a thought form or a collective group mind\nMaking a thought form that becomes autonomous kind of like slender man okay I I wouldn't say that ... kind of an egg regards Letterman really\n... sentiment is is fictional he was made on the Internet okay but he becomes real\nWhen two little girls lure another girl into a playground and ... and stab her because they said that this this egg records that serving a master whichever the master the creator is is actually influencing these girls to go and kill something\nSo that's what you got you got a a mean you have a toll but you have an ... and those things are are set out to grow into become either monsters or or just serve in and once again the hunk ... says the same thing and what is the un PC me it is the bald\nThe you know ... basically does the will of its master\nRight exactly and it really it's it's one of the stock changing devices that that is that result it's the backlash\nAgainst this these autonomy and that means a lot of time and it's I guess you could say\nOr anti autonomy thinking process that just totally dissolves any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all that is putting out it was all those all of that in a in a\nSplit second and it and it that's what makes him so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really did change people's minds up really quick way\nWell this is you know even more ancient magic let's go back to the Jews okay let's go back to ... what was going but he was a a it was an animated anthropomorphic being made of clay\nThat was there to protect it was a monster that was created to protect the Jews pretty much it was there to protect the children in Prague and and so they created this this this creature out of clay or he was harmless to to uh those he was a made for but he would attack those who were trying to attack them\nAnd and so this is the same principle it's the idea of creating\nAn Internet column creating an Internet amongst us an Internet tool or an Internet ... if people you know they don't understand the meaning of means means are certainly like this they are the thought forms that when when they are unleashed\nThey can cause trouble they can call it caused ill will but he once again goes back to what Chris has been saying is is it made it so easy to create a ... if it's so easy to create an\nAnswer ... perfect form that is illustrating a programmed a botched if you will\nDidn't we know that we live in a matrix we live in a programmable world that the bid there it's getting easier to program because people are becoming more susceptible and not dealing with plane consciousness\nThey're not dealing with a movie called primitive consciousness the idea that they can either feel or understand anything at all and I think this is the confusing part is because people are getting so confused now\nThat they're reaching a point where they can't even find you know simple\nHow can I see this from a three hundred and sixty degree perspective once you do that then all of a sudden the programming breaks and when it does then you start to see the world for what it really is and you start seeing elements in the media or in the political atmosphere\nThat are good some elements are bad you don't come from a place of left or right anymore instead you just come from a place of what is right and what is wrong and the way that I defined right or wrong it's very simple\nLike darkness it's natural law it's a A R U hurting somebody air argue impeding upon somebody's freedom or are you a damaging somebody's property\nUm if you take a look at the situations around us and you asked yourself does this piece of legislation there are about to pass\nIs that impeding upon freedom is that impeding upon life liberty you know these basic fundamental principles of freedom\nThen you can take a look at the piece of legislation for example as what it is instead of saying well my party says this and so I have to believe this are my party says that\nUm so I have to believe that and then pretty soon realized that this whole divide between us has been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other up while they continue to manifest all of these realities that they once but really to power lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality\nAs I said before I have the CIA document in my hand called\nUm analysis and assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest the reality around you\nSo by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us you know in the church or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but that's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but when we can do also is we can pick up a rock and move single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire amount and starts to change from\nLittle by little you know I always used to say I used to be a slogan a you know getting the truth about one mind to a time and it it just seemed to me that that was that was spinning back then but now it's the idea of\nBreaking through this accepted emotional by us and getting that out of the ways that we can get down to the bottom of what really is true but the dirty ugly truth\nBut it's supposed to set us free but I say hey you know what what you find out it'll pick you up in the process so you got to be careful of what used to do what you think true Jews and get rid of the confirmation bias it's all part of the program and it's all\nPart of exploiting the PC and everyone Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred will not caught\nOn News I'm Carmen Roberts President

even comes to to to thought everything to themselves I've lost my mind because they're already there those who are trying to question it and wondering if they are losing their mind are the ones that are saying because they're stopping\nFor a moment going wait a minute this reality or is reality is it something I should be using in quotes\n[laughter] bunkers called bunkers bunkers [laughter]

blowing people's minds for sure um it's hard to process at a on the surface and\nYou know I Would say that the way that you determine if you're an NBC or an organic is just the ability as you said you know to question that about ... yourself to question the nature of reality\nAs you said an insane person never a question Sandy\nI'm by the same person always to say wait a minute or am I going crazy here and that's the process that I went through when I started breaking down the matrix I started asking myself am I crazy is this no system and bringing out from Iraq consciousness really lining up and then what happens is I come across the book after book after book that's basically saying the exact same thing\nIn a very different language um but we're putting it all in modern terms and\nIt's amazing I never would have thought that we would be breaking these levels of consciousness or that we would even be waking up to the holographic nature of reality but when science is backing it up ancient books are backing it up and now we have these means that are floating around and\nYou know these and PC mean sure they're being targeted to the left but it's rooted in some kind of truth I mean it comes from somewhere and that's the reason why it spreads so so so heavily and the programming is breaking the them at the matrix is breaking and if I can get one more example of how the matrix is breaking\nInto glitches um we have all of these men tell effects where people legitimately believe that loop I Am your father existed in Star Wars I remember Lou ... her father mirror mirror on the wall um in Snow White doesn't exist in this timeline people look at it from timeline shifts and so on and so forth\nI Would say that it's updates coming from this artificial intelligence within the matrix that's hitting our brains and the update simply are not sticking anymore and so you have a big portion of the population that remembers the things the way they were before the matrix was updated\nWhile at the same time you had the MP sees that are being updated almost on a daily basis especially through a that data wave states that they put themselves in when they're glued to the television are glued to the phone I mean it's getting so bad that they have baby bottles\nThat you put your phone and so you don't have to look at your baby while you're feeding it you can just sit there and be in that data wave state while you're while you're feeding her baby so um it's it's splitting the Vail has split you\nSplit right down the middle and consciousness is is ... is being revealed for what it is organic and non player character\nI Want to recommend a book and it's a book that uh if you were paying attention is in the matrix in fact that the book where\nI remember those guys come to the door the one girl had been rabbits tattooed on her arm and he's looking for I think ... or some sort of drug Annie and a meal has hidden in the book in his book ... the the drug and
