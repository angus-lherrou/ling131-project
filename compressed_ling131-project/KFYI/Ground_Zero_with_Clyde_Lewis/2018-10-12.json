you want\nHe's demoted\nYou know we want so many people to go out and vote but we don't want certain people to win and if they win will keep being on civil to one another if they if they lose maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the GOP violence situations well that three expected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary Clinton says\nConsequences be damned we need to have instability until we get what we want\nEnter claim of civility could return when Democrats have power is a measure the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she says this one we've got Republicans that are being shot stabbed docks beaten male or a rice in powder\nOut of restaurants

dangerously rude but they are being rude nonetheless not violent not yet ... does not have a party ...\nA lot I don't think anybody realized that they don't have a party they don't even have a left right there are a black bloc okay that I didn't call to talk about any phone\n[noise] what has been done\nBy Hillary in the service of whoever's\nPutting out the black box and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said remember that most you you prove this the other night\nWhen you did your show that most Americans have no idea what the word civil war means\nIt does not mean\nA civil war no not necessarily all means no not necessarily not at all civil mean state Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it means it means within state\nInstead of with other states as what civil war means and that'd be a new civility nothing however Hillary said the exact opposite of go go up the pilots that the\nCivil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the word simple\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as a\nSeed it's a dog whistle it's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it wow\nShe all she had it was dropped that word because it confused too many people and that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence she's just saying um it'll be nice but she's using that word because\nWe don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nBut in that case then she's going to have it backfire on her when you agree\nWhat do you mean\nWell I mean if she was ... it was a dog whistle and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards the conservatives you seem you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not a ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes to cheat I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but it is obviously you got the New York post printing out newspapers said a hundred Clinton just declared civil war\nThat's right that Hillary doesn't doesn't control the post no\nThe post controls Hillary done me controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who want to civil war and the media doesn't know it\n... doesn't know it to be strapped doesn't know it to the deeds they basically are you using the media to manipulate civil war and they're using both Trump and Hillary\nAs pawns in in in the whole
