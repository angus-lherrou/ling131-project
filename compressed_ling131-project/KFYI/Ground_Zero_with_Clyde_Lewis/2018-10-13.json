I mean he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a ... if you will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but then there's a starting the New York times to visit the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\n'em when we when that's when civility can start again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they said they were in the new democratic\n... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that\nThey did what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama\nWho who is the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats\nWho came out and said holder comments were bad that's her phrase that was being criticized rain but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama\nAdministration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable was for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nosed as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least tried to hide it this\nSwitch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic\nIt's amazing how they all claim to be\nNew civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the ... that was his deal mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X things might have been worse\nFor ... for a for blacks for a while\nI mean you're back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as you know as you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking is either\nThey're horrible horrible and the people\nAnd the totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist right like there's very few people were like you know what the All right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to read a bit Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nYou know the deaths that happened before or the testing to see a lot of people you know point to that\nDid that for Gus Grissom as the beginning of the conspiracy theory that we didn't go to the moon\nAmong Americans\nBetween Eighteen and twenty four years old twenty seven percent back in the Nineteen sixties expressed outfit NASA went to\nThe moon over the years there have been many more people but also a stepped up and sit down and believe it then the moon I don't believe that we went to the moon\nI Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all this time that we have in the Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two thousand one a space odyssey took time for bear did the moon landing stuff\nAnd of course we were shown in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film is James Bond gets on a moon landing set Nineteen Seventy eight Capricorn One movie the talks about men faking that the Mars landing\nSpot or two thousand and one of Fox special conspiracy theory did we landed on the mood basically saying stating a fact\nThat we never went to the moon bend came by several film titled a funny thing happened on the way to the moon he claimed he had footage\nOf the astronaut speaking the famous earth shot and\nUh it's it's in Israel and if you want to look as funny thing happened to the way to the moon it shows the astronaut speaking be the the famous blue earth shot\nSo you know there are plenty of things that can cast doubt plenty of things are getting cast doubt on whether or not the moon landing happen in two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon the Orion program the ... the crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually with a two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut ah it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon within Al Cross a rocket bull\nCrater the ministry of there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had survey ears and landers in and orbiters mapped the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a crime and China was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking the stations are but they they were they had to enter L A ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice\nWithin the moon's crater so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless the LCROSS mission was a failure Brock Obama pulled the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project which kept us from going to the moon and a\nNine billion dollars is cut from the program and uh it slows down now here we are in twenty team\nWe've been told that the moon is the gold again and what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national NASA mission\nThe briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering in medicine it says it says in the briefing and says that ah\nIt's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include a studies at astrobiology\nStudies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe and every phase of all NASA missions\nDestined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think ... it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the ... waves are in fact Russian scientists ought to colliding starts thinking it was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out of Senate sop alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\n[noise] and in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that Arabs because of that\nAh but in recent years we in the show has been discussing that\nThousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity diversity of life on earth and and also a means discoveries would bolster and and we were closer to\nThe chance to life could exist on other worlds and therefore all space X ray exploration missions now should incorporate technology to find traces of alien organisms\nSo you know with the number of exoplanets\nThey've discovered with all the ideas about life on other planets\nScientists recommending but NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument meaning there isn't anything ready now nothing that can fly out the space to take care of this problem nothing that can traveled to distant worlds and measured the composition of its elements minerals organic matter that sort of thing\nSo the report suggests that direct imaging systems to suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improved detection\nBio signatures from planet that might or but those stars NASA also uh is being told they can plan for more missions appear under the surface of exoplanets however the average to locate extraterrestrials\nEither in our solar system are light years away is going to cost a lot of money\nAnd you need to advance technology to do it well here's the deal NASA space launch system the S L F the new rocket they were putting together to go to the moon was supposed to be the the designed to go to the moon and then ... and then eventually go to Mars is a very powerful rocket\nApparently um it's running years behind a schedule is a lot of major cost overruns and it just got slammed by internal audits\nTwelve point two billion dollars to develop this launch system\nA Wednesday the auditors came in public to report highlighting problems with the work of NASA in Boeing and the report five sixty four million dollars in extra fees were given a NASA they slammed the Boeing ... report from a poor performance and questioned the long term sustainability of the super rocket program\nAnd the report even calls into question the sustainability of an entire project meaning that even with all the bright ideas and designs and the idea that we can go out and find daily and now this rocket won't even make it up and launch pad for years won't even make it to the moon\nSo this whole newly manned moon project we're supposed to have going on by twenty twenty ... may not happen now so I don't think space worse it's going to happen either I mean so you know once again we have this movie first man\nA big old infomercial for NASA and they can't even get a rocket off the ground sure we can sit up satellites probes robots but the man to the moon with a new rocket yeah we can't do that\nDon't have any more I mean we're going to do what we were going to do it in twenty Fifteen\nBut Brock Obama made that go away and it was just it was still supposed to send them out of the moon by twenty twenty and Ashley will not even be able to do that [noise]\nHave been there more than three million after pictures are right wink wink I bet I bet what\nHe says he says it as he signed it\nFor me said that Glenn hold on year at a special dreams Ellen game\nI'll oh that's great well see that that's the big question though you know there's so many questions that are unanswered about sixty nine mood mining and whether they win whether or not they advance to ban stuff in a studio where they were orbiting the earth the whole time\nOr even that's how it could have been done the rocket went off the orbited the planet just like they do the space shuttle uh in the meantime bed already a pre produced a number of uh shots on the moon and then it was time for them to come back the ab ab a command module back to earth splashed down and no one was the wiser\n[laughter] I I I didn't get a ...\nA year a believer aren't you absolutely okay\nWell I I have my question I have my doubts I mean I don't you know the battle Ryan spacecraft does not go up in two years wouldn't that send a doubt into your head or at least next year window down through your mind that they're they're they're screwing with you there playing with your head\nWell my brother is working on the project it was the shuttle project since its inception he left and went to start a company and they got the ground test contracts for all we are getting something to Ryan tribal inside and\nWell it'd be a Ryan goes up that doesn't mean we're going to the moon see that's the thing is I Want a guy I Want a man on the moon before\nI die that's that's what I Want to see I don't think I'm going to see it and it sucks because\nI I thought I'd be go to the moon as you said earlier yeah it it was just\nIt it kind of that kind of twisted me me quite a bit\nYeah well it hurts me enough to have my doubts that's all I got to say thank you glad going thank you I mean if I found out tomorrow that we did go to the moon and they could prove to me beyond doubt I'd shut up about\nIt but now there's ... I haven't seen anything yet he convinces be we went to the moon only\nTV [noise] and believe me they can do a lot of things with TV\nA lot of things they did was be fooled people do a lot of things on a movie set to that's why first management theatre\n[laughter]\nBaking fake it and they can make it back then to\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred in Tripoli except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis Ulysses ground zero and we'll be back\nOn\nThe business\nNews I'm Carmen Roberts destruction beyond belief got wrenching that's how people describe Mexico beach in Panama City Florida after hurricane Michael ... like ... ... ... it's very scary it's the same at Kendall air force base air men and women being told don't come home that yet\nAnd it's simply not safe enough for people to return structures are on sound and many roads were blocked by trees and power lines were going to need some time to make it safe\nColonel Brian ... commander of the three hundred twenty fifth fighter wing storms killed at least fourteen people and for state police and the policy five South Korean climbers and for Nepalese guide their missing on ... Hamel Mount Vernon that's after a heavy storms down and the winter and friday night mega millions\nJackpot for next prize six hundred fifty four million\nHi\n[noise]\n\n\nMichael Jackson says he wants to go to the moon really so he can earth [laughter]\nWant them all [noise] just say the word now all run\nOf why the U.S government\nWas telling me that\nJuly ... finding Roseanne sucking on\nAre like ...\nI call this the one area and\nWhere the radio show that keeps you up late [noise] like to see a\nSpecial a load all the driveway losers tonight [noise] those are stuck in the driveway listen to the program the want to leave your car do you I wouldn't even [noise] oh cool things to talk about the\nTriple a basic Seventy three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nThat is true believe six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\n\nTo Michael in Oregon Hi Michael you're on ground zero by longtime first I think you know all about\nIt I just enjoy your show but I'm about that ... that if you think about it what what more genius way to bluff somebody thinking he got more technology than yeah\nVideo pick of moon landing right\nWell I don't know if they did it on I'm just saying if if they did it was genius anyhow\nWellbeing about this a T Barnes was on the show when they could be classified some ox card a project ... card with the ... project very fifty one you know he told us he said that the new in the satellites were coming overhead so they had to go out on the tarmac and they had to put cardboard planes on the tarmac to give the Russians the idea that they're working on some sort of an aircraft\nOh I remember something\nOr they used they used to put a fake aircraft that big car board airplanes they used to put on the on the runways reprieve you wanted to pull the Russian\nYeah yeah I remember that\nSo I mean there are plenty of they're putting fake cardboard planes on the tarmac a dairy fifty one that could easily uh put together some you know grace soil put it somewhere on the sound stage and uh and make it happen they they could easily\nDo that I mean I don't see why it it's beyond the pale the thing they couldn't set something up or do close ups of a\nOf a ... just like they did or you know for Star Wars I mean\nWhat Lucas did was basically what they taught him\nUh what do you learn from the NASA mission when he made Star Wars he knew they were able to use miniature ... I mean who would've thought miniatures so advanced would give you the idea that you're looking at something like a death star it was it was just amazing\nWell that's very true yeah\nYeah and they they could possibly do it but you know and then another thing I I don't think our scientists now have the engineering backgrounds as it for now set back then as well so that could be another thing or not coming up with things you know if you think about it they're searching for life but they're not looking for electromagnetic signatures\nYou know you'd have to be a moon or half of them oh\nWell I have about like magnetic signature you see what I mean yeah\nWell I mean they they are they just they come out with all this stuff saying well we want y'all to you know when you do your mission has got to have some sort of a plan to find alien life whatever you do for him and conceptualization to be on\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the last program so what are we going to now\n... ... right yeah when I have to weigh out after that I\nI ... either way I I think I Will come out and the next few years whether that it or not it'll happen\nWhile I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean they were going to go back on their ideas already went to the moon but\nThinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs don't kinds of other crazy stuff I mean what if you said that the Russians hey\nWe're gonna we're going to the moon and we're trying to go to ... go to the moon and uh you know we'll give you a little bit of money\nYou know you read this or this little space race a little more interesting and I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge you do a race that I have compared it to like the fat kid\nGoing up to the the ... guy saying hey I'm going to I'm going I'm going to run a race with you and I'm going to beat you\nAnd then in the ... and ... and the the guy it's all going to say OK guy given a chance and so one day the guy wakes up and says wait a minute he ... he won the race how did he do that and that's how I think Russia saw this big him we were before we were more successful in the United states was and now they're doing this how they do it how would they get Ben on the moon impossible", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "13"}
