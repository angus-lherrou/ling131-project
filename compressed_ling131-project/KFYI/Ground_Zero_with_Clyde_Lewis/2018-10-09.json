G. wells and\nUh several other people Thomas Edison Mark Twain all having connections in fact they said that even does be was a member of this plus ultra group and I thought well that sounds really believable is plus ultra real\nWell\nYes and no okay 'cause I'm finding out that maybe it's not called plus ultra but it's something else even just be was a part of the golf club thirty three to ... he\nCreated it was just a special club for some of the people he knew and some very special people and of course a lot of people believe that the club thirty three comes to the thirty three degrees masonry because ... was part of the Malay when he was a kid so plus ultra\nIs there any truth to the idea that maybe plus ultra may be some time travel group for some group it created a a breakaway civilization on some other plane a utopian plane well H. G. wells are as you know\nThere was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another fictional movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fabled time machine and the movie and it's kind of ...\nCryptic late says H. G. wells buried Amy Catherine Robbins who died in Nineteen twenty seven\nMinutes just as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel and women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was the Fabian socialist\nHe was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new world order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works that he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or a utopia that basically emanates from a global government there was a ... let them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty\nOr the world will be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who fortified the war machine and so that actually approximate what really happened in World War two\nWell then he runs several of his books that that there was a shadow government there was looming that the shadow government was\nThere to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing it kind of like we've been joined Israeli said about the British Government and\nWell well you know he was a visionary we notice and whether or not he was a time travel is anyone's guess I don't know if you're a ... but he according to this movie was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla\nIs also one of the guys that was in this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie\nOf course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine but he was be I guess the American equivalent of H. G. wells\nWell by the time of his death he had patented ... about seven hundred things but after he died in Nineteen forty three\nAll of his possessions were seized by a government office called the government offices of alien property and about three weeks after they were seized all Tesla's things in documents were given a thorough examination\nBy group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump who's the uncle of Donald Trump our president well what's interesting is that you know John Gee Trump said that Nikola Tesla's papers were really amounted to nothing but\nA Trump went on to ah actually create X ray machines tests who was working extra machines inside but he created them and of course Trump Donald Trump always says well I come from along the light of intellectuals and very ah geniuses like my uncle John J. Trump John ... Trump he was a genius was well\nWell um what's interesting about all this is is that the question is what Donald Trump sunk all find those papers in Nineteen forty three well\nThere's a question as to whether or not just had a time machine and that there was something about the the era of wells the era of Tesla and uh this this writer who the science fiction writer\nHis name was Ingersoll lock would unlock wood was the author of of a few books\nOne that raised many eyebrows a couple Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and another was called Nineteen hundred and then there was the last president well both of the books are in the library of Congress you can read them but Newsweek did this strange article and twenty Seventeen basically saying that\nThis barren Trump character in this book goes to Russia he gets advised by a character named Don\nAnd then he goes to the Fifth Avenue hotel in New York\nAnd then a Fifth Avenue a hotel or whatever it was it was I think probably the Waldorf Astoria if I'm right basically had some significance as well because there there were there was that book by luck would called ah the last president and in the last president\nThere's a quote from the book this really interesting it's about a state of uproar in New York after the election of an outsider candidate said that the entire east side this is from the book this is in the Eighteen hundreds by the way uh it said the entire east side is it a state of uproar police officer shot it through the streets warning city folk to stay indoors for the night\nMoms have vast size or organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists and threatened to ponder Indus spoil the houses of the rich who have wrong at a press them for so many years the Fifth Avenue hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob the novel continues\nSigning it address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands by the way Trump Tower is on seven twenty five\nFifth Avenue in New York\nThis all sounds uncannily weird and of course it sounds like fiction\nHow a ... oh my God oh\nNow how from out a way I Would have to like what happened when I go back and um [noise] I don't know how long how long I have a hard time how camera\nSo what he's describing the ... how he transforms over time\nWaiting in a room that's kind of like a zoo\nBut the aliens or whatever they may be the God like these of energy use it and created this to make him feel at home like a palace is it a palace and he's waiting for the years to pass and then he goes into another realm where he comes back to earth as sort of a Superman or a king or a leader\nOkay and so\nI I look at a parallel there of what he says is the mythology because I read Joseph Campbell and he talks about the ... we've had many presidents over time including Brooke Obama\nWhere they said that use amount of medical heroes very strange about you know Obama's father not knowing much about his father kind of like Superman you know not knowing much about his father that kind of thing but with Donald Trump\nIt's like what do we know about his article what do we know about his father what do we know about his family what do we know about his relationship with Nikola Tesla what was it that he found in those papers that were seized\nBy that alien group or the government the FBI and why is it that he likes to stay in the U.S like what ... talked about this place where plus ultra is all over the title\nAnd plus ultra is a fictional [noise]\nTime traveling secret society where H. G. wells the Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison and Ray Bradbury and\nAll these visionaries were a part of it it makes you wonder doesn't it tomorrow land is truly a predicted programming\nWe don't know for sure but we can get your calls coming up Tripoli picks up at three thirty seven hundred that's triple eats except at three thirty seven hundred will be back\n[noise] way of\nAnd my my [noise]\n\nAnd\n\n\nNews I'm Carmen Robert Still replay for the non the associate justice of the Supreme Court sworn in for a second time possibly to make a point\nIn his remarks Kevin all thank all of those at the White House in the Senate among his family and friends who shepherded through the confirmation process he vowed to work as one of the team of nine justices all of whom we said revere the constitution and while he acknowledged the process had tested him he said it did not change them\n...
