will hardly think I shall meet the test its power disclose the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into the into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it's in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada bought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the ... makes it a prominent glass into\nThe market I mean ... everybody was buying them and using them in the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark passes name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but that would be that this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself\nOr what have you are in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make around and start customized selling them\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I have never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money I there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really whether or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he tricked into somebody mental institution\nRight in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing it would be avoided or any kind of prosecution because we checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any ... any of this information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\n[noise] well which is kind of awkward 'cause I haven't really [noise] you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy\nUsed to work for a car and share which is an old TV show or\nOn a which was only channel five or something right in the east and um\nShe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like um the show he could like producing I think ... by current affairs and then he was the one who introduced it to the guys that make these um [noise]\nIt's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nLike it's the same image to same exact [noise]\nYou know but then they took it and they just put more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know I mean in the background to ride the background history\nYeah and they will I told them everything you know and they put it down but they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know got to I'd I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary\nAnd if you if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody is we call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back to shape it a shot a joke ...\nNo I'm a ... and I want to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use a board in a long time let's be honest with you to board\nA gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean I you know boards crew rudimentary like that even even\nWhen you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights so that her little boy could give the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of bear or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves to pour just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into being able to to access your own abilities to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own six cents ... started developing really started really being fined tune\nAnd taken a good way I can still do this work and be a lot of people use and the old days the typewriters [laughter] word processors now that use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up the receptor so you could start bringing in the information and so again I Want to be real clear the board there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen\nUnless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so people doesn't mean it'll people scared us even talking about this on the radio so I have\nAre do they they they think they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and\nThey don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and then it's a deal motor responses are that are based basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions in the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body and the brain are big transmitters\nAnd so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip but it's like a way to to view I mean people would use pencil but I I used to know a media embed would or would he would do his thing he would just scribble you would take the hensel\nAnd he would just scribble on a new bad and he just scribbling scribbling as he scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at going all I see a scribbling but what I what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of doing something with his hand Louis mind was bringing in the information from getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are you using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the motor response that certainly is a interesting when you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking about Bob's warrior care and\nI think maybe that's part is true that he did get did change have a conscience but he was a scary guy and I think he he almost was like scared than like a ... a bad big like the hell's angels type of guy he was he was a different kind of scary\nMhm yeah I can imagine that somebody would agree on their face or you don't know whether or not what they're thinking they just have it\nBut she was granted that those eyes but certainly are how bad the the the Arab mid ship about ... and some things so you know that that that certainly is something that uh you know keeps people on edge it makes them feel like you know they don't know if they can trust or you know it just makes me feel\nA little on the edge so I can understand that what we're going to do now is a you know I was talking with Karen actually using\nA the Skype message and I was asking her if maybe and I'm gonna ask you on the air or we were to ask blisters to call in a tonight and ask questions of these guiding these ... these white beings you're the guiding beings
