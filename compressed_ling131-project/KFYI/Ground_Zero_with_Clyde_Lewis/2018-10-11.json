Patel and\nAn of course there was a similar sound which is a pulse wave sound was picked up by a man in northern Sweden\n[noise]\nManaged sweet and said that the sound filled the entire sky it lasted for about an hour he says he's like something went from one end of the sky to the other end and uh\nSo could this be extraterrestrial aircraft could this be test aircraft could this be something that could be sent from space like a signal\nThese these real cosmic XO cosmic dust signals coming through there are a lot of things to think about it especially when they're discovering some of these particles but don't exist there they go against the standard model and that's what blows me away let's go to her when in Tennessee I heard when you're in ground zero\n[laughter] Hi um I'm I've found this topic very interesting and uh um so I did a little research on the ... because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the book\nRight during my research I found out they were getting you know from a number of sources are boys saw large metallic cloud\nOf ... and ... no Nineteen eighty seven eight mhm and and um and in fact the neutrino or detectors have to be buried so\nVery very deep in the ground and they have to be extremely large\nBut what what where it came to my attention is this has been in Arctic go where are you know at the poll a media right in in media or they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's commonplace deprived thing it's just all faith\nIn in that and touched reach into our planet right um so ... you know it came to my attention let\nWhat if while they were building this neutrino detector sip it has to be so deep underground so large that they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been\nYou know ... and and and that may explain to you you are you a microorganism\nWas he that's it you know it might be well pro pro whatever they may have filed with building lift detectors or the question is you know ... what is the\nFall out why does it go against the the uh what do you call the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera see right not son particles\nThese aren't new apart these aren't these are not neutrinos for the sun is you're not neutrinos from perhaps a quasar something else these neutrinos from or what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or do you think it would be similar to nuclear fuel\nSo this is it's just something that doesn't belong on this planet is being ... for the Antarctic ... space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and the majority of them was perpendicular throughout ... and they were finding their detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the polls you know they're there but\nThat's a bit odd out to make our magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of the atomic particles right and ... and you know\nIt it is really concerns me 'cause well you know ... ... ... you have to be buried deep underground in filled with water\nAnd in in order to you know to detect neutrinos that\nLarge numbers of it has to bounce off a particle right ... ... a heavy water ... you write and what we did it say heavy water molecule it creates a flash that the detector can detect\nIt left out they detected neutrinos now while they're building that incredibly large apparatus this you know this is this\nIs the trainer detectors are not quite at least not quite as why we know as the um had drawn a collider right at least those things are a lot about twenty miles law in in ... at least take these trees are detectors they're\nNot quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of gargantuan nature and when\nYou're getting down there I think this dirt or hundreds of thousands of years I mean I'm we might need a little bit later found a A R literally yeah like the movie\nYes they moved around a thing as it did\nIn ... and they could open our planet up to something we're not ready to her\nAnd they and that's why they had to bring down a Russian Orthodox a patriarch a president ...\nAll the all these our all of these um um\nPublic figures in in the politician van and scientists to what you know it it is scary\nCome come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the the creature that lives on practically nothing lives on Aaron sunshine doesn't live on any food lives in a harsh conditions\nAnd look what he's putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a signal back and this is why we're so concerned about tech technical signatures SETI\nThey could just eat the microorganism whatever they found charity you know we carry microorganism bacteria\nIn our bodies are foreigners just to live just for us to survive you know good and bad right now what ... wherever they found that may be there and it may be very first to our biological\nSo they're keeping contained there obviously but they they're they're they're certainly concerned\nAbout the signatures it's giving off there certainly concerned about what we're hearing what we're watching this the the fast radio burst the ... the rumbles in the horn sounds in the air they're concerned about these things because they just don't know how to identify it they can I Do\nNot coincidence no it's not going to blow it is going out and said oh something's\nBeen found in an article or something it was a a actually sending a signal out from space I Believe it was more and more they traced the signals to an article the neutrinos signals were also trace\nThis is definitely communication and they won't tell us it's communication until they most certainly habit pinpointed as to how the communication was set and what was done and what the what the result will be\n[noise] in the in this day and age that can't hide anything no had anything from the public I mean we're going to find out we are going to find out ... I Hope we don't find out too late before we can do anything about it\nYeah it's amazing time 'cause Oh thank you for your expertise thank you for calling the program see it's a it's it's definitely something and I'm sure\nThey both the president or those who want disclosure and all this never thought this is getting to be happening the way it is a lot of people are like you know talking about you know other things going on in an article that may have nothing to do with this but it certainly is interesting how this is all coming together I don't think anybody is mentioning\nAre way way all week and she's a ... from extraterrestrials and uh I Believe that uh yeah I'm open minded as far as that as that goes in and I think that\nAh there's either party and fifty years of of of his time and uh I guess he passed away and uh I think ... forty three and a lot of his\nPapers for a you know taken and things like that they uh anyway uh\nAs far as that is an athletic uh goes and uh they're the same thing bad will vote or anything like that\nGoing project high jump that was a long time ago but yeah going back there saying that he had seen a lot of crazy things going on down there I mean nothing that can be verified I guess but history seems to speak otherwise I think you know\nWell they said that he was he what he had about five thousand or was it twelve five thousand at least are\nAre soldiers and a scientist that he took down there and um he was attacked and then uh he uh had to retreat to leave and uh uh they were ... you know a\nA usual aircraft in ... and things like the entity\nMaking ... things like that but as far as ... aims he flew over\nAntarctica so you know the big opening their and all that in a ... there was you know\nUnderground lakes and all they're in different temperatures you know Seventy degrees and all that but I mean as far as the ... the sound to me I mean I live in a you know around the\nYou know we have bases around here and stuff like that and uh you know here thanks all the time and I'm\nElle with as far as the atmosphere and can trails there or was it by capitalist country over here they is that here in our town and here you know things like you know you can kill a lot of waves that way you know as far as that goes\nWell I think that you know what we're seeing here is we're seeing a lot of things from all elements in all of\nFactions and we have the geo engineering happening we have a you know we have these discoveries that are going on and they can't put their finger on what these discoveries are but they do say that there are strange they say they have to reevaluate how they analyze and what they think of the phenomena that they're they're studying and so with that in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "11"}
