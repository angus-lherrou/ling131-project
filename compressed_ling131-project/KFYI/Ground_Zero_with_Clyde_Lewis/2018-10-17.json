Bradley Cooper ... deserve an Oscar and nobody deserves an Oscar 'cause you have to go\nYou know what I mean I don't wish that on anybody you're punishing ... punished or with an Oscar no ... there were just phenomenal he is as good at singing as she is acting\nIt's incredible uh and\nUh just a great sir I saw it\nWith my wife on friday and we went in there was a whole row of forty something year old\nWoman women are all coming in with a glass of wine a and uh it wasn't pretty it it wasn't pretty uh you\nKnow they just wanted to him with his shirt off and uh it just was it they would stop and they drink and they drink and they drink and they drank and uh when we walked out I'm not going to give away anything but it it happens in his home in the garage with the last couple of scenes\nAnd you know it's\nIt's kind of the climax of the whole movie and a and you you know it it kind of is a threat that we was throughout the entire movie okay and they were standing in the lobby on the end going\nAt it that isn't what happened a garage\nAnd they and they were like and the other one was like I don't know it was like\nOh my [laughter] how did you eat they were just so blasted masses why you did see him\nWith his shirt off so that was good for them stay away from alcohol yeah I could do some really good you should see it\nUm yeah uh and uh it did me doing very well or\nAt least as far as the reviews go people are talking about it as a big time Oscar movie have you seen\nWhat is it first in the first man first man have you seen that\nI haven't um though I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding that movie ... which I mean we talked about when the story came out that they didn't put the scene of than planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of this story\nI mean but the the argument was is not is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rocket and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander\nWhat's the problem right\nIt's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie ... I mean it's\nKind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man press another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah but um but we now uh now I have not seen the movie\nUm but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie I mean they they they can cite but you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like they just a patch or yeah which which you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you I Would not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see\nThe flag planted in the mood in the background later and already been planted in there and they show it somebody they're voting the flag they just don't have that moment not good enough what if those forty year old women\nAre they like has hired a flag cabinet and was there already and it is ... and\nA couple of bottles a certain age you might not understand that but I mean\nAre we not just the victim here of of\nOf the sheer outrage like it does not seem to be a thing now it most of it's not most of its this okay today there's a\nTweet from Donald Trump oh did he say something crazy of course they did is we from Donald Trump today we're also talking about a war in Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee heritage\nWhy ... what he does this matter I mean you know again we have to Saudi Arabia thing going on that as much more important I mean not to mention that we are going to hit a trillion dollars in debt again\nI blamed the pilgrims really serious and tradition it's our parents and history puritan ancestry\nSee I I I blame will William Randolph Hearst\nOkay I can see why he would do that how about this guy hardly an sling or you know you know tell me about him ... or with uh with uh the first drug czar in column and drug czar but he went on his ... marijuana we say back in the Nineteen thirties and Nike Ortiz Murphy ever going to movie ...\nYeah I remember ...\n... a a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to\nTake the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually turn of the ... century ... Spanish civil war maybe after the stash American War\nOr are they a lot of Mexican started to come over here in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana\nWall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up they created the ... campaign around reefer madness this idea that you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny I'm calling from Madison talked about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a marijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and if that didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever say but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are ill\nWith people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing marijuana and like you said earlier we created at least a police state around are around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through\nA marijuana our psychedelic or even with opiate why don't why is that we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we do against marijuana I'll tell\nYou this is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are most young conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme additionally to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd ah when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this and I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the law did every day the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you tried something I looked as though no no no I Can't do this\nAnd he says what's wrong he says by should I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try ... uses and and and he was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try cannabis and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know so ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind and one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about uh things like a cannabis that\nThey ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an agreement on their joints can ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form weren't edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a ... a a a a ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs for this country as such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis not with jail time and and punished but\nThey they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest or they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better a far better thing for this country\nTo look at people with this is not feeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help\nAnd they're in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people\nPut them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained is gonna be put into the position of criminals\nThere actually put into hospitals were they were under a medical arrest that would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because the problem is banned and you can agree with me I Know\nThe doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep\nPain inside the body that is not pain but it's felt physically but it's pain that is spelled on a I mean I guess you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is in pain or wracked with pain\nExplained Al Gore hey don't work on that I pay they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people last spoken to many people\nWho say that they like things like ... and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over ... or biking Dan or Percocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their pain in the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as as the roads that most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be ally basically ... you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're and\nThis is my got here and it's been caught you know you can't move because it you know your core has been cut you can't move and it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced and that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication\nYet to make a distinction between dietary supplements and
