Texas hello Shane welcome to the Glenn Beck program\nHey thanks for taking my call ... ... ah yeah I'm from Texas but I went to Portland to visit my mom this summer and I bought my young children in downtown Portland used to be you know beautiful and fun and now it's oppressive unsafe\nSmells like pie and cool and like if I park at the wrong place and don't pay the meter I get a ticket you know presumably if I don't pick it won't go to jail but you can camp out shoot\nYou know drugs and smoked crack on the sidewalk which people are doing and um go ahead and getting poop right there and you're good you're good to go\nA ... and I felt very unsafe with with little ones they're it's it's not a place I'm going to be going back to\nPortland used to be a beautiful city just a beautiful city what to what is what is your mom's say about it\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state\nWhich is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I Divide that this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreed with the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this quarter and wants to take over to go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\n[noise] Oh hi Clyde yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things to just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\nLike I had known ...\n... you know so\nYou had a the Turks came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise]\nWell if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have a the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true\nTo me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it yet I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because\nYou're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy\nAnd the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections\nSo what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide\nBeads stay manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence would this is this happening\nAnd and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust well\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy ... look at\nThe un other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral can be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow starts to escalate now how how\nDoes Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ... is a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes them on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is\nOf no consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watched him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out the Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey has said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh they will not at all I have a country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it to\nProbably do the same reason you said that he was in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can get in there and the embassy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nMay be arguments the CIA was facilitating operation deep late ... argument that he said operatives\nIn the CIA for facilitators to the murder of vis a vis Yogi and of course Saudi Arabian\nOr a deep said operators were involved here as well how's turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too but what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more can be gives the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you wouldn't want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia is\nThe thing that I have a feeling do need to do that while I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean the the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you got Bolton who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and pay most of them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he ...\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies and we had an immediate gasoline shortage there were long lines for gasoline yet and they went to the odd even license plate right so you can get a a one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even\nOn the I think they went by the last number of your plate\nSo I remember I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my\nWe had two cars so I'd have my wife gets up the car for me to get the car ready for the next day\nAnd then that day she gets up the other car and because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed\nAnd you can only imagine the leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now if they fall back on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by St Charles are any other me or that we're going to fall back or or oil and I think they used to figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo it'd be looking at ten dollars at the pump a gallon\nOr easily by critics I don't know does does want to call their bluff\nNo idea of being a bait and retaliate\nIt's all watch and wait now right and that's why I brought this up because this somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about ... and I thought what am I talking about and then I realized oh I Know what that says I looked over and I figured well gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America\nThe stabilizes from the pomp destabilize with inflation destabilize this\nWith an economy that's going to go bust\nAnd then what will we have do will have to be put on a war footing by by Christmas Time\nRight and I remember the key thing is though is if this goes south quickly it could really affect the mid term elections and the Democrats if Trump looks bad the Democrats would easily get control of the houses\nBut I mean I I just don't this is one of those situations Peter where I Would just have to wait and see how it all plays out 'cause right now it ... my my my feelings are that this is a deep state ... a ... type operation where they had done this because it puts President Trump at a very bad position especially before the election\nAnd the fact that I said before and I said I think it's I don't ... don't show I said that I think our next step is to destroy the economy and secure a war footing and that's our next rates so I mean this could do it\nLooking at I think we have to look at turkey airborne the endless than the shaky footing or the wall and his own with his ...\nDropping like Iraq right and and he got ties to the hardliners in Saudi Arabia yeah and and it's possible that it is a a a\nForm of a ... within Saudi Arabia that instilled in just served to ah serve to help a turkey get back in August ...\nWe'll see what happens here we'll see what happens right now I I look don't it doesn't look too good Peter thanks for each of the Gulf ... they get Tripoli victim at three thirty seven hundred will be back\nWhere\nAnd I mean my my [noise]\n\nHanging\n\nThe News I'm Carmen Robert a federal judge talking about Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against President Trump to judge ruling the\nTwin question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United states the first amendment protects this type of rhetorical statement\nTalks his choice Gallagher President Trump tweeted that the adult entertainers claim that the man threatened her to keep quiet about an affair with him and a composite drawing of a man for a ... job severe Santa Ana winds likely snap the eucalyptus trees and California crushing a woman in her car just tried to help\nIran and over and I said there's somebody in there and I ... that I Am and can you hear me there was no response to assure her arm reason other than\nThe tree killed thirty four year old Jeannette Burma the first\nMajor Santa Ana wind events [noise]\n\nWay too early one gal rejuvenate air conditioners every day we're famous for it but if you're a scene is more than eleven years old it probably needs the ultimate rejuvenation rub planes men you could replace our system because their motives are hot and meeting am more because the compressor sounds bad but\nBest reason to get an energy efficient new free on companies state in dark ghetto because their boss\nGet on air conditioning has been awarded one hundred and more teams passed by the U.S on one hundred and ...

undermined down more than Donald Trump\n[noise] [noise]\nI wouldn't be caught [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] oh\n[noise]\nI'm quite Louis [noise] you're listening\nZero a lot of people are saying and something interesting to see the writing me and telling me that we're supposed to be independent now boy we produce more oil and Saudi Arabia well the question I have many as it were that were that\nVision why is gas so damn high right now don't get it I mean we've we've seen it you know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even a two oh five two fifty a gallon but now we're pushing four dollars a gallon\nAnd uh I I really think though that would have an effect probably not as much of the fact is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by me but I always get into the sphere that some some day when I wake up see ten dollars at the pump because of something we've done or something that's happening\nAnd I don't know the the the world down anything is possible anything that we speculated about in the past is coming true it it's just\nWeird how you know and and if you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves in a in a in a moment of scarcity what am I talking about ... weeks ago with what the Henry Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must for scarcity\nIn order to demonstrate what it would mean to\nRedistribute the wealth redistribute goods and services in and and make everything uh a happy global family see this is what they're pushing for an outside interest and outside interest that is not\nAmerican constitutional republic not democracy it something else they want and they they they need to make their dance and ... they need to traumatized enough to be ready because they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty\nThat's where they've been saying they're due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a and that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United states of America\nTo go to George in Kentucky Hi George you're on ground zero\nHey I have my foot here scenario world that I think you're right that each state but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that day rallies way Trump has to ignite the public\nOn both directions good and bad or we have an if\nShirley how George George no leisure like how do I say my life but you know you know you need to acknowledge the fact that they've been other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be\nThe major but I think the next one coming up is it ... all of a sudden we're destabilized with this tape state airing evolved and all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on elections and we'll just carrying the turtle till we stabilize\nThe country do you have the war\nSo this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend elections so the president but\nNo it's not stupid if you think about it well he did he would lay that loss you got lost in American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I can hear Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the point is between I think a lot of these plans and everything that's going on think about all the uproar what's going on and what this is setting up for an Emmy again if you look at it in a respect\nLowest lot going on and it's not happening but then you know okay well that can't happen but it is happening look at all the diversity yeah I'm like that's happening with the Arab bite up or you got all these\nA fraction of the people that are just ... fit about everything in the
