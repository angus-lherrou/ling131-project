a confirmation vote this weekend that hinges on three swing Republican votes and possibly some moderate Democrats\nWe're talking about we're talking about rice in being a ... at the Pentagon today we're talking about the possibility that they were trying to stall this decision for the FBI or maybe even solve the boat uh we're talking about that right now\nI I guess what am I Wonder if they'll try to sell it just goes dead than it would cause each state to well we can get a good cause\nYeah so a lot of us that the constitution and uh\nAs far as\nBuying it's going to you when you call a program stick to topic it's going to fill in fact the hype fill up your own ground zero\nGlad high up I think it had a memory\nOut the story that they're still going on in in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven and a matter of fact\nThat morning at nine eleven before the planes that tower had hundred reporters an outsider Democrat Senator name that guy ... ... and and the investigation under ... shouted lady ... remember that\nYeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers and\nThey lost like getting a function that they they are but after the towers that story was there was a guy like you didn't hear about it\nOr have you been to say oh I Love you I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item into the towers went down and then that everyone was like about after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a ... ... being a chief justice [laughter] which one did again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Shawn Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case\nWith Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I just wanted to put that out there and I'll let you get\nGood very good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it class I loved it and you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I don't either I\nMight be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep

two Eighteen as you said right which is an eleven\nEleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it and\n... you might want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh All right yeah\nI'm saying just one thing but I was calling up about the rice and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of productive programming\nWhat happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming well\nI mean you can see that there was something going on with these ah when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like

in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where there were already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations\nAnd they're moving a ships to the ass off to see a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest you know\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about Kavanaugh in his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by ...\nNow do you have the ... not ... I'm Sorry to tell you some speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but don't Mitch O'Connell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last word because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's\nThe last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you didn't really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed but I think\nThat is around look if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women is I treat women I look back at her and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt it and then even then I had an\nAgreement because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay for\nYour legal you know any excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump for what he says in fact he causes own problems on his own but when you have people\nThat that basically a sumo things about you in public and yell at him out all over the place I get very angry about it in fact I get mad when people assume things about me being run through and the reason why I\nStand on anything and you have I mean I don't know why you don't have\nIt doesn't matter and got out of ...
