government enough that we abide by its outcomes even though we may disagree with them it's always been the case Americans even if they disagreed with ... with the government\nOr a a form of government or something going on a government disagree they bring their differences to light the boat baby used constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries but\nMore than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries little over now we've had disagreements in the past and that's something to this country does it we have a\nDebate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and uh and and that's something\nI think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with them and that's nonsense\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history meeting sixty one where\n\nWe distrust of the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree\nBut it's such a disagreement about how our system is run and we have a ... we had a civil war there was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a you know border\nDivisions and things of that nature it was clear cut it short of civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to feed it a civil war is happy because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pope and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration\nIs proposed by none other than John McCain\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police or be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... we'd be declared it'd be aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post as to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on\nContemporary standards not the standards of Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there were major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and I actually executed by a those are the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one\nThe country would be entrenched in national polarization with no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\n\nNumber three there will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate nation of violence to solve any and all disputes\n\nNow I Know that that's\nDamning to actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing in speculating about dean state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst that this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always been\nThe dark command it to a leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nThey were looking under rocks for false flag proof while we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine received a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis\nAnd chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice\nAnd yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just we're attacking officials but this isn't registering in the media today\nThe only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombing or part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive these were attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance are using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique Republicans are not unique\nIn the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happy to do a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there're journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent the journalist we've at rice student being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders\n\nJust like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible\nFor the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance is it's forty years sequels selling out to the theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul\nYou also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds with every moment in the film they live\nResources OK and Jew instill that illegal that everything is going crazy as it sounds familiar to anybody\nWell yeah I I Would I Would say that you know what you're what you're describing\nIs a you know as you say it it you you're spreading out resources you're spreading out uh information you're you're killing one side of the information spectrum ... only give birth to another site visit full on asymmetrical warfare ... and that's why I think it's important to the point that out\nYour act exactly right I published an article today called pre does worst enemy today is the mainstream media because what again most people don't understand is it's a civil war you were describing\nAnd we can find many cats but it will pass okay but what you're describing\nIs um face to face one that continue\nGlobally is an elitist civil war\nOkay there are factions fighting here anybody who believes that even Trump can get into office the highest office in this way without having to kiss somebody raped me and that would have used a different metaphor but we'll stick with rancor right now I'm is an idiot\nIt would never happen\nOkay so we're looking at one faction against another and they are playing the American people like spread very\nWell the opposition the instability of of the political discourse is one of the first signs of civil war the idea that violence is the only way to somehow or change the discourse is part of civil war all of these factions are part of civil war and the only reason why people don't think we're in\nCivil war is because it didn't happen the way they were told it was going to happen we're not having an armed conflict right now between America and there would be Americans shooting Americans well I mean American shoot Americans\nEvery day or Chicago or it seems to be a highly climbed written with guns going up and things happening like that but when we have bombs into leadership where we have people who have to a planner Dram mob these are ... and parts\nTalking parts of the sign post symptoms perhaps of what would be a civil war and as I say the diagnosis does not come preview it comes from history and I said sometimes you don't know what your rent until you have somebody step out until you you're in the middle of something you better get out of it sooner what's going to get\nWorse Roger Landry would have stood on a ground zero more from him and more from your calls ... three thirty seven hundred will be back\nOf the News I'm Carmen robbers President Trump told the rally in Wisconsin the U.S will find whoever's responsible for package bombs that the Democrats and others\nAnd he acts or threats of political violence heart attack on our democracy itself the FBI\nConfirmed perfection package with congresswoman Maxine Waters and California bringing the total to having the president also keeping an eye on Central American migrants in caravans you want to enter the U.S it will not happen talk his way enlarging effort in Mexico\nMost care band members are on aware of the bare minimum needed to qualify for asylum what game are now in my sandwich on there and then we come from a country where there's a lot of violence and we want if they play for our children and that may be true but President Trump says the Caribbean will not be allowed in\nAnd no winner in power both the jackpot rolls over forty seven hundred and fifty million dollars on Saturday this is talk knee high\n[noise] I I\nI don't have to kind of hanging on by everybody and I'll hang up I hang up [laughter]\nOn the other\nYellow Europol them they want they're calling the\nI I actually my only going\nTo tell you are so good being angry hold\nOut right now in the usa left and right wing Americans are dyed in the number more than one thousand adult fashion Americans to describe themselves on social issues [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nEverybody\nEverybody\n[laughter] you know I\nSmall homo home are always saying

hundred [noise]\n\nVegetable lazy Seventy three thirty seven hundred [noise] mom sent two leaders democratic leaders today [noise] them in the\nMedia is in an uproar over this in for sure they are but somebody wrote me because I didn't know that ah the Republican\nLeaders some of them were sent rice and in the mail yeah that happened just a few weeks ago and that's the thing is that whatever we focus on is what people\nWe'll get all excited about what's excluded they don't get excited about what they don't see they won't add up to say hey we're in the middle of something really bad here\nAnd it ended by the civil war that happened in South American the Nineteen seventies and eighties it's like what happened prior to Ukraine and then when he was these stabilize these things are happening in America and no one sees it from what it is\nRoger why is that people are not paying attention why don't they why don't they just stop ... they they they're they're completely incensed and they want to continue this I guess maybe it's it's just a waiver so your\nFrustrations out or why do you think this is happening\nWe have we have had established over the last three generations in this nation\nSomething I'd like to call program ignorance as a matter of fact delivered if they can projects entire ... um you know ... whatever you want to call it is um the eradication of program they meant what you're looking at a generations\nOf obedience generations of liberalism you and I are both discussed as many times in shows look at the ... rules that are teaching our children and colleges look at what passes for a college professor today and the politics these kids are coming out of college with but\n[noise] if you stop to consider all that we have been exposed to All right we've been led to believe that drugs are the best thing in the world and will do nothing but help us drugs kill\nThe we're talking about legitimate okay prescription drugs prescribed by a doctor kill more people in this country a hell of a lot more than both guns and automobiles combined every year we have a dumb down the side we have five percent of the world's population but we take\n'em almost twenty five percent of the world's\nA psychiatric foresight to tropic drugs including our children now with at all of these things up with add up the education let's add up the politics which add up the um uh the medication was at a we put all of these things together this is where we were before we went to break\nIt don't just bring a pistol\nIt don't you bring a pistol a rifle a and I could go on and on let's step back I started all this by saying well we have a bunch of micro vision you say why are people focusing because white now\nWhat's going on in Europe right now what's going on in Mexico right now how many different things are going on in the United states in each and every one of these are noteworthy and people's their heads at whipping around so fast or about it whiplash but if you step back and look\nA mass majority of all these things are connected ... not being perpetrated by the same side\nBut they all have goals those goals are and you had to get this over and over again you get this nail on that over and over again they are for the ... the elation of you and I this is the program's ignorance\nVicious why you get so frustrated at talk talking to people the way you do why the liberty we can get so frustrated but we still get up tomorrow and do it what am I got this wrong ...\nDo you have an Indian see this is the thing I don't think\nYou know civics our civics are no
