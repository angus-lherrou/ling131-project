L. S. it's getting close to make people comment cry\nWhen we're not talking about that right now we're talking about what's happening out in space it's not about enough that I go to mark in Colorado Hi Mark you're on ground zero\n... thanks for taking my call that a lot of sound bite kinda sounded to me like an old dial up modem modem trying to communicate\nWell with an old dial up modem it was a it was the the sensors that are picking up what they say is a rattle under a under Antarctica and that's what they are picking up it's rattled but some are arguing that what it is the wind blowing across the snow or the ice and that's why we're getting that sound and others are saying it may be from something else completely because\nThey've been receiving these neutrinos signals and they didn't know what they are\nSo something is active in an article somebody who's active in space right now they're shutting down the telescopes and there and they they they shut down you too for temporary period of time to get something they didn't want us to see went on in space last night was going on right now in space\nRight but uh but I guess I don't think it was a mother or my or something else other than that and the train those uh that's like a radio reporter Charles ... to me you know\nI was just bizarre I think it's bizarre that the that's the sound uh that uh they picked up on and and while they it's in the science journals still you know geoscience journal saying well this is what we think is some seismic waves were picking up on others are saying well this is this is sending is like you said it's like a repeat or\nSending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in all the coincidence ... we're going on in the past three days\nBut I liked it off the single going into that coming out the same and the strength\nTo do anybody anybody could take the signal and they could speed it up or slow it down to see if there's\nYou think inside the signal because I used to have a guy who he would hear signals he'd say well let me speed it up and see what I get it needs to be to have all this like rpm and you'd get all these weird sounding site band voices going on\nSo or the you know whatever that says it could be I get really even slowed down side band or a spin upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure they saying it to be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust decreed this type of\nUh the sound uh it does sound very much like something out of preventing planet and sounds like something you'd be from an old Nineteen fifty science fiction film\nAnd uh once again I I played it and uh I get I'm getting worried that when I played it I got some jamming going on so I don't know if they're trying to block from playing this I mean what's going on and kind of reluctant to play it again but maybe if I get enough demand I'll play it again so people can hear it\nOne quick question and a ... more about that you sort of the sun\nThe structure in front of the sun\nI thought that might have something to do with all this\nIt it's one of those things that we get out into the the ... that's for sure that something you know that they were looking into its sunspot certainly connected to this we we we never know though I mean sunspots shuts down and then all of the telescope shutdown\nWe have the rovers shutting down on Mars and then we have YouTube shutting down so he's telling me the Amazon shut down and I don't know what that's about it but maybe maybe something else is going on maybe this is some sort of a test maybe I don't I don't know but it just seems a little weird a little awkward\nThrough talking about a possible alien invasion some people are feeling like this is how old are you in Beijing would begin that you know we can't have the story was rocket going up and send it back down and get away you can't go into space the INS is banned and\nAh you know all these things are happening and no one's giving an explanation as to why except the budget is going in to protect the planet from extraterrestrial attack have just increased Ninety million dollars which is also something to pay attention to\nIt then you go it doesn't sound like the winter may but\nI wouldn't have either I agree with you mark thank you so much for the call I agree it doesn't sound like the wind doesn't sound like anything like that it it's\nIt's just too peculiar and if you tuned in and I a lot of strange things happening you to shut down last night possibly because of a viral video [noise]\nIt was sent by some man who apparently a looked like he was military warning people to something was about to hit the moon is also footage now going\nRound of what looked like an armada of UFOs going into the moon or going around the moon\nAnd just because it's being talked about on the show like mine rather showed it's not conspiracy\nTheory this is happening okay tell me why we have two major telescope shutdown tell me why it's so use rocket couldn't go to the eye at that tell me why the rovers shut down as well all three of these uh ways we can see the space of shut down for\nYou to shut down last night because someone said they were pushing a video by really about something hitting the moon last night so we wanted to take it down and they had to shut it\nDown to get up you didn't have before anybody saw you must have done a good job because I don't see it I didn't see the ... the uniform
