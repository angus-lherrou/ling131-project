civil war\nAnd it's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it is happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs not two sides fighting against each other even though there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're seeing somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's\nPatchwork of affiliated

be\nCalled\nThe wars were then all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything but it doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identified the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identified after the war and that is what historians do\n\nWe take a look at all of the things that we could say were little skirmishes ... and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city is it is just it's terrifying all
