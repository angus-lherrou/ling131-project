story apocalypse but my dad and God if you watch that that's a lesson\nIn in the fight between what is the dark powers in whatever powers out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming regulation of the matter if it\nWould be increasing globally should a globalization of political and economic institutions it's becoming easier for a relatively small group to deceive itself into quite staggering influential positions\nAnd one couple in particular reveals alarmingly what another small group will do it's driven by financial belief systems and are called things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate that has control over the world the spiritual realm\nBut what is it the thriving right now in the midst of globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex things that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read and understand that's why I come in every day early\n\nAnd yeah you can go through all of the bad guys the masons the Jesuits accusing them of controlling all the spiritual realms of what appears to be the same trio called however it becomes more complicated\n\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or priest craft that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of is I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I've studied my my entire life what I what I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new world order from a simple ideology to a worldwide super state can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder you can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\n\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I use the the word synergy\nThere was a guy by the name of a Joseph ... say knives\nAnd he had an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\n\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that his pre destined to rural absolutely at odds with the event emerging concepts of democracy\nAnd so he decided that the only way to win and to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so\nHe wanted to transmit the secret synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual bothers us that are key were of course the knights Templar\n\nAnd other groups that you don't actually spawned and and and new ideas and and mysterious mysterious subjects and hidden meanings and certain conjure rings and all of these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker type\nOf rule of dark command that actually uses the darker powers to create an arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group of conspiracy of men or women that foreign like priesthood and are ruled by a secret society hoping societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing\nTheir power plays within the United states and in the world the formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies but from there there were other conspiracy groups other secret societies\nAnd I know many Christians in America believe that the ... one of the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies business half true because\nThe rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely Syrian\n\nAny bordered on things like her medic arcane them announced the system so from the very beginning we've always had that group that are simply observers baby there custodians and they make things happen\nAnd they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\n\nTo the apostles to the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching up any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a\nGod a God that they don't approve of and they are on the opinion that the dog was if any guy\nPeople are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why they're really ... in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite and this is why\nWhen you see things happen but don't sincerely seem godly or or Christ like or or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions you look at the numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions in the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I don't\n\nThat's why you know I gave a few clues
