and well one of the things I really appreciate about our mentor in this program is not only like you just said\nThat he's going to help us with making money but he's also going to change the way we think\nOf what's great about this is I always say it's like taking Warren Buffett and Tony Robbins and combining them and and then put them together and you've got our mentor or how would you like to

hundred five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that but this is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody\nWhat makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh is my wife has even said that when she sat in on a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter]\nAnd and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy\nAnd our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software and it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling your stuff and his analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand so\nThat knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you'll walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved you call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nA thinks John you know first of all ... just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just to just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is at our mentor is providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on if there's not an active trade developing there's just nothing there is just silence no talking and you can attest to this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet\nSo between what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to receive the most level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed his program\nResearch this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase thinking ... so that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's a simple follow along color coded system\nThat he Berkeley describes as well as it's happening there is no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen\nSo when we say the system is very simple and it and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times\nIt's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software in its signals is unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen and I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself\nWe don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show we want you to see it then you can believe us after you see it\nYou can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in the day\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories but I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars\nThe day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of\nGive us a call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nReserve you're spot in a couple of our sessions there
