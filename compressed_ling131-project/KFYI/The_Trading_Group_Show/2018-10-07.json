... changing the way you think\nWell that's right John and you know what we really specialize in\nWhat we specialize in a setting people up for business for themselves from home or from the comfort of wherever they want to be again as long as you have the Internet you're in business all you need is something you already have which is a computer and Internet access\nSo it sounds pretty amazing right

session\nA trust me this is actually what you're gonna see you're going to see that everything we say in the show is actual and factual and it it's not exaggerated or overstated it is the real deal

or or ten o'clock eastern time just depending on what time zone you're in\nYou know the genius of this program actually host the training session as our mentor she put this whole program together so he moderate to our training session\nAnd all we do is we follow his program his software program\nThat tells us exactly what to do and when it's really that easy and while the software is telling us exactly what to do\nAnd by the way it lights up it's like a Christmas tree and our our mentor is verbally describing what's appearing on the screen\nI you know how easy is that to follow along I mean it's kind of like the game of follow the leader so everyone is in the group and the group is quite large we have people from all across the country\nYou know and by the way on the show we always like to welcome our new members or we don't do it by name anymore we've got a we've we're we're a little too big for that we have about fifty new members just in the past month\nThey're looking at investing a small amount of money and making it grow this was a great avenue to do that and what's really nice about our program to\nYou you actually received the software now with other groups you don't receive anything you get to view things and usually that software is way more complicated and you've got to go to technical school just to swallow what you're even looking at let alone all the multiple different types of trades that they have\nWe've got one trade we've got one trade you're going to learn and about an hour and it's based on what the market does every single day of the year that it's open\nAnd it's called a one two three turn around and it's it's really simple anybody can do this so if you're looking to be productive from home if you're looking to start a business or by business forget that you're going to want to check this out\nYou know we have a young lady in our group this is a great example she's from Seattle and she was looking to start our own business she was actually going to buy a dry cleaning business and she had never been in the dry cleaning business but somebody told her it was a great price and I think it was about eighty thousand dollars to get started\nAnd she considered doing that but she instead went into business for herself with our group\nAnd ... for a fraction of the price for well under ten thousand dollar she was able to get started with us total out of pocket\nAnd she's now in the group and productive making money after her training period and the training period a short it's about two weeks you don't need to go to technical school you don't need to get a certificate it's an easy follow along program\nWhere you can learn everything we do in a short period of time and be able to go live comfortably and that's the great thing you know we prepare you\nSo before you go live with your first trade you've gone through that training period\nYeah and like you said we both do this\nAnd last week I did better I did better last week in one day that I did in my previous business in an entire week I used to work forty to fifty hours a week running my business\nAnd now I can do better in one good day than I did and an entire week and I don't have to work forty to fifty hours anymore it's absolutely amazing opportunity you need to check this out if you're looking for a plan B if you're looking to make five hundred five thousand dollars a day\nThis is the opportunity you\nCall it eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven and like I said\nYou get to test drive the Ferrari for free you get to get behind the wheel and and again that number is\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\n[noise] we're the trading group show we'll be right back\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nUse of the school board terrifying attraction one\nLocation designed\nThis audio is for your review and now for ...

plans from up to my health\nTo five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that but this is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh is my wife has even said that when she sat in on a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter]\nAnd and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy and our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software and it's nice to have the expertise\nBut to have him there motivating you and telling your stuff and it has analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand so\nThat knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you'll walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved you call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nA thinks John you know first of all ... just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is that our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on if there is not an active trade developing\nThere's just nothing there is just silence no talking and you can attest this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet\nSo between what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to receive the utmost level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program\nResearch this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking ...\nSo that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's a simple follow along color coded system that he Berkeley describes as well as it's happening there's no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you drew it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen\nSo when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software and it signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen and I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself\nWe don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show we want you to see it then you can believe us after you see it\nYou can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day [noise]\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories what I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of\nGive us a call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nYou're
