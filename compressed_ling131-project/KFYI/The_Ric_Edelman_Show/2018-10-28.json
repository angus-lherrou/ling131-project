{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Because it's verbal it has no force at all first of all he had his first of all these are the same for me to keep it yeah first of all you can tell you I never said OK\nOkay he's alive he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this weekend to pop off and get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it okay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point\nVerbal agreements mean zero\nAnd that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law\nAnd common law incidentally the law started\nNot as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which show a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years a steamy\nHello Stevie okay I get you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to just continue my insurance\nWas Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty I\nMean sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you uh there was a penalty you give up your health insurance quickly Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that you'd be\nOkay so so really what I'm ... well the reason I'm going to do it is because I have Kaiser so go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not they habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty if at all\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea yeah I'm assuming it so now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can\nHave the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would be oh areas because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but they subsidize the penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm right now which in legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there is nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a law that's introduced right now\n[noise] ah so this could take this one new ... could take\nIt was going to take years but a neighbor pass but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes yes ma'am what can I Do for you um get by with apart had a partnership\nWith the fact that a lot for nine years and we put down ten years ago\nWe had originally filed bankruptcy personal bankrupt before so I Would label it file on it but my partner filed bankruptcy on her yeah he'll come back after\nA well what kind of business first of all was talking about the business was in a an AOL see or corporation\nWith the get the partnership\nA and yes they can come after you are as a one of the partners is that you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nI Know it happened quite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but one that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to buy any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you can be found at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process you know you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nOn it was it was like hey I I ... that went on that practical ...\nAnd why did he go under not an ... and then there weren't enough customers are wearing a\nRobbery I got my check up or down after nine years\nYou got ... neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nTerrible Marino valley huh wow that\nWhy it got really bad after nine years and we get that to shut it down but I was going to be a critical that like my partner filed are there that that would have taken care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and do what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's in your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy do why wouldn't you do an El Al see or a corporation\nOr low yeah I Do I Do oh she said it you know I'm a dumb ass so I didn't have to say it although I'm going to repeat it Dorsey Hi Dorothy yes yes [noise]\nAh yeah for a long time ago me and my girlfriend\nYeah that's five hundred grand a week that you could generate an income that's a hundred thousand dollars a day five days a week I don't know how you spend a hundred thousand dollars a day every single day we're not going\nTo know probably who won the lottery because in South Carolina they let the winners remain anonymous so what could you do with the money well you could probably by the Tampa Bay rays baseball team that's worth about\nA nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only about half the teams are no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees are worth four billion dollars you could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because the total GDP of the British Virgin islands as about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number\nOne tell nobody that you won not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know a secret because my house no\nAntibiotics that deposit box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not willfully\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million of taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends in charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always now you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you gotta do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to uh extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the Ritz we were me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security and when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute\nHow much money you're going to give your mom you just method after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you ... come on\nYou're going to give her ten million you just got a hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you've given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give\nTen people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars guess what you didn't\nGive away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend not them you have to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is\nForty percent which means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars\nSo of the four hundred and Ninety two that you now did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to\nThree fifty we haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them in whatever you do for them ain't got to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying the lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars is what you'll have won the lottery\nOf course past performance was known kitchen future results I mean social the contras a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket because as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery\nBecause it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one subject\nAren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you not win the lottery on Tuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that they're not only didn't get much you got a little poorer because of the stock markets performance and we're going to talk about the stock market and what it means for your investments than what you should do about your investment strategy as a result of the new\nVolatility that we're experiencing in the stock market and the bond market and the real estate market and the gold market and I'm going to tell you all about it when we come back here on the record and show AAA to plan wreck\nBut maybe you're not around to call us when we're around to take your calls so here\nIs an alternative for you send me an audio clip of your question your smartphone has the ability for you to record a quick audio it's real simple and easy I'm not going to tell you how\nDo on your smartphone and when you record that audio send it to send

representative Mike\nKelley on Fox miss is Fox News [noise]\n\nI'm Tom Shane hey guys wrote in ... here at Shane Company our diamond buyers are constantly in the world\n[noise]\nWalking back to the wreck out on the show we invite you to send me your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Rick and Rick Adelman dot com\nIraq this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much an interesting about only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you tried to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we what are you don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nBut say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money ... bills called today but think about this when you die\nWho gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours if there's and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your to the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing in real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just calls to Tripoli to plan wreck or visit us online at rice element dot com\nYou know we've got some of the aftermath of Hurricane Florence and Michael we've seen just astonishing devastation those storms came so quickly

Edelman financial dot com slash review hey let's jump out to the telephones and talk with Kirk he's in pleasant range Michigan Kirk how you doing\nHi Rick thanks for taking the call and very good happy to how can I help I have\nA question regarding financial literacy I have a twelve year old son and a ten year old girl who I talked to a lot regarding the importance of managing debt saving money and invest in for the ...\nThey both shown some interest but more so my son I got a book from the library which my son read the entire thing and when it's very excited when he read something about how to invest you know three thousand dollars for my summer job into a rough IRA in forty years later it's worth or you know big number\nIt was all excited and told me dad I'm going to be a millionaire someday so I'd like\nTo continue um you know that thirst for knowledge but didn't find anything more at the local library for him to read\nHowever I Would also like him to learn more about life general financial realities things such as various bank account savings checking credit unions how to balance a checkbook\nUm various kinds of insurance credit card in credit card debt and then just also investing for the future so I'm Wondering what books are digital media would be available for his you know that would be age appropriate for him\nYeah I don't like a a word book or software to go along with it so it can provide like hypothetical examples for him to work through their anything out there like that\nKirk on going to give you the applied [noise] uh\nSo he gauge than so focused on financial education for your kids\nYou know we lament in this country that there is a substantial amount of financial illiteracy\nAh parents seem to be talking to their kids about everything these days religion politics drugs sex but they're not talking about money\nSo I'm really glad that you are and because we have so many Americans growing up financially illiterate they're not taught me this and K. through twelve or they aren't getting any college classes on it in their employers are certainly not telling them much about money so I'm really glad you're getting your kids off on the right foot I'm going to give you two answers\nFirst is my first book the truth about money\nOr that book is considered a classic in the field a personal finance was named book or the year I'm by the Institute for financial literacy when it was first published\nAnd it covers everything about personal finance from getting out of debt and dealing with credit all the way to multimillion dollar states and everything in between\nUh and the first three parts of that book are really aimed perfectly for your children understanding what his money held his money work of understanding compound growth\nMake sure you wait all the options including the cost of the old plan versus the new plan\nAnd yet according to a new study from Lloyd as many as forty percent four out of ten Americans to change jobs cash out\nTheir retirement account [noise]\nThey cashed out not only incurring taxes but at ten percent iris penalty as well and because they take the money and\nSpend it according to avoid those trigger billions\nTens of billions hundreds of billions of dollars of lost retirement value [noise] here's something else it gets even worse a lot of workers have borrowed against their four O. one K. at work have you done that have you taken alone against your four one K. guess what happens when you leave your job\nThat loan is doing payable within Ninety Days\nA lot of folks don't have the money so what do they do they end up defaulting on that loan losing a lot of money paying\nTaxes and penalties and Deloitte says that have denounced over two hundred billion dollars in lost retirement value because of those defaults so you need to talk to a financial planner if you are preparing\nTo change jobs why because we can help you not only deal with the retirement account you've got the you don't\nLeave it behind we can also help you in making sure you're handling your new retirement account with your new employer correctly argue contributing the proper amount have you selected\nThe proper investments we need\nTo make sure that you're handling it correctly call us a AAA to plan wreck or visit us online at rice Stillman dot com if you'd like our answers to your questions about handling your retirement accounts old job at a new job during job transitions\nTennis another transition underway it's coming from fight go you know what that is fair Isaac and company fight go is that big organization that produces your credit score\nAnd that has huge implications for everything from how much it costs you to borrow money what interest rates you have to pay but whether or not you can even get that loan cycle scores are often used by landlords and employers to deciding whether they want to rent a house or give you a job\nSo the cycle scores a pretty big deal a lot of folks are unable to borrow money because they're ... score is too low and credit card companies banks won't let them any money well\nFight those says they're making a big change the biggest change since the Nineteen nineties this is the biggest change in over Twenty years\nA new scoring system that will take into consideration not how you manage your loans I mean traditionally that want to know did you pedal and back on time what if you don't have any loans they're going to look at how you manage\nYour cash how have you been managing the\nMoney in your checking account your savings account your money market account and your bank\nBecause their attitude is if you've got an average balance of at least four hundred bucks and you have an overt drawn\nIn at least three months and you move money in and out of the account a lot showing that you're managing the account well your score will now rise it's called the ultra psycho score it's going to be brand new introduced early in twenty Nineteen\nAnd you will even be able to tell them which of your bank account you want them to consider so if you do have a bank account that you kind of blow it on\nThey won't count that one is you've got a bank account you've been managing it properly and that's the one they'll pay attention to fight those says that seven million Americans who have low credit scores will see their credit scores go up\nAs a result of this making it easier for them to qualify for loans this will make it easier for them to buy cars which will enable them to get to a job the the otherwise might not have been able to get to and lifting themselves out of poverty it'll be easier for them to qualify for mortgages so they can enter the world\nCreating wealth that ranchers\nDon't have an opportunity to do is easily so it's pretty exciting that fake I was coming up with a new program called the ultra psycho score you might want to pay attention to this and I'll let you know when it becomes available and
