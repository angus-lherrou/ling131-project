{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "I either a a sales a receipt I mean my daughter had a a very old car a that she gave to a friend of hers\nAnd ... and ... but it made sure that it was Roger certain she has to copy that is registered or you were going to say what\nThey auction off the bike and someone else ... records were coming after ...\nYeah because they impounded so just say no cause you stole the bike and argue and I don't understand the three thousand dollars but ah I'm Mark your defenses are are attacking\nThe three thousand dollar impound vi and somehow proving\nThat you sold a biker gave it to your body and that's all you can do and maybe your buddy will testify saying yeah ah he sold the bike to me uh and I saw him registering at ... ... I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark 'cause you don't have they have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just it's just too easy to ah attack you on this one so argue that feeds you obviously you totally collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them just to you and then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims soup probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous even a disputed is your credit already been attacked\nRight yeah it probably will out at our credit\nYeah probably will you gotta mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWell my friend I mean half the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them negotiate say I'll give you half the money now\nI Know and but the thing is I I mean at the money more than anybody I wrote or giving them money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pounds sand or you look at your credit you got your choices none of them very good unfortunately I'm not a good\nPlace to me sometimes and I often say this is a ... everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about all I have you committed a crime yes or no right it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's a statute\nYes thirty five miles per hour is law you went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated she that's clean stuff I loan you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nWhat is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the to answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not me\nThere you go silver lining every moment\nOkay or Alexander Hi Alexander I'm here he is or what can I Do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judgment disappeared and I received a cat's always showed up that from the IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay when I say I view oh hold on are you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYeah okay so the IRS is now saying you will or you're forgiven this much\nDebt and die and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't they sue you or they just wrote it off\nMe a original credit card company I owe Fifteen\n... did they write it off or I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so that means you were that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgive me ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay if\nYou you can follow it a little bit better be original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean be credit card company after\nGiving up years later that the IRS\nYeah no I understand the IRS a ten Ninety nine on your behalf because with\nAn ... for the amount that they said I owe you said Nineteen thousand dollars the original that fifty nine hundred I think are like that they are or if a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hundred and it\nBut the fund is going to have expenses which means you're not going to earn ten you're going to earn ten minus the costs so if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter the year to date the past one or three years anything can happen in that short\nA period Ohio was suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're going to hit in twenty Eighteen and they're not suggesting that the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year to date they're saying that over the long term they're expecting\nTargeting an assumption of seven point two percent and oh by the way that's before fees because you know Ohio doesn't\nPay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know the people who invest a hundred billion don't pay the costs that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point\nNow let me take another step further when you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating six festival returns is by picking the right\nInvestments in other words there are Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick\nWell let's look at it this way according to temper on in twenty twelve\nThis is six years ago\nThere were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the U.S and the five hundred that year only five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred and Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred and Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred and Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty so off the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf stock mutual funds on the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nThe the us and the five hundred every year for five years in a row one out of thousands so unless you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going\nTo outperform the market\nI don't think so I don't think we can do it in our firm we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive investment\nApproaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market minus fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes and inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo of you packed and above average fund a fund that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe\nYou lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any crime [laughter] hey you\nKnow hey I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets not the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term financial goals and objectives are met and to that and I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class\nAmericans forty percent are facing poverty\nIn retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers\nSay that they are going to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not buying\nA lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick joining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot and avoid and what's not that's not the key to achieving your long term financial goals our goal here\nFor you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving and the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's why your call us AAA\nWreck we've

also got a couple of radio listeners who are unhappy with me here's a voice mail I got this weekend\nGood morning my name is John I'm I'm listening to the economic right now I'm looking\nTo eight ... those people that don't have enough in there on\nFinances to retire and this must be a sixteen year old he quote expert I sixty four\nI'm lost a tremendous amount of money during in the market my husband he passed away a hedge fund and I'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than my Social Security and I am against it before you see jak\nAt companies should work until there Saturday because they'll be dying in order\nTo provide money for their retirement is you know it's not just saying I can recall hearing number one number two the other thing that she'd be considered in one's life\nOn if I can their finances is the quality of their lives and many times working can be very exhausting\nI'm poor people that are stepping day and um and Seventy five I mean I think that it's an incredibly um thoughtless comment she has made on this show this morning and I'm horrified that he is agreeing with everything she has to say\nWhy don't we gets worked for where Ninety or two we guy maybe that's the thing to do that\nWith that is now worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she sold said but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault that she's now finding herself and retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working I I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts\nUm and maybe this is why we need to plan butter and we need to more effectively get professional financial advice before throwing all of our life savings in the hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives I feel badly for her but\nI have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation um but here's another voice mail but I got and this boys you might recall hearing before\nWith listen I'm calling to say that I work at him and tell us quite a while and I decided I Would never invest and him\nOr his company he goes on acknowledge him about a simple answer that take three minutes he takes Fifteen minutes and keeps repeating themselves\nLike he has to al ... is he no longer a good example of like clear swift thinking it's boring now that it takes up most of the show was stupid questions that she doesn't stop answering he's a little help\nI think she's too old to keep going on with your show it's become very boring let's talk about the financial crisis this week [laughter] that is going on and on\nAbout stupid question he needs some help themselves to fix this show I don't just feel that I'm a psychologist several of my friends have listened to feel the same way he just wandered all over the place like a loss soldier\nSo the fascinating thing that voice might be familiar to you because nearly seven years ago in January of twenty twelve she contacted me for the first time and here's what she said back then\n[noise] I'm a college and to listen to this maniac on the radio where\nIt goes on and on wham wave second maniac planting you can ask if man and they came back to the people and taking individual\nAnd their lawyers and ham if I liked it ended on it\nI Am actually wait I aged out of them and it's crazy renting get him somehow and shame on hand by God man\nBut know what was fascinating here is look I I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure what psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help or she should be recommending psychological help\nTurn them into other investments and they strip out\nThe interest in principle from the securities because some of the investors want the interest and other investors want the principal a different time periods so they\nTake these treasuries and they strip out the interest giving them to one investor and another investor gets the principal back maturity and encircle strips in so Wall Street invents lots of products like this they invented lions liquid yield option notes\nUh they've got tigers treasury interest grain tore receipts there are page after the income generators but no nobody on Wall street has ever created a bear because you know that's all street doesn't like bears um we like balls but I don't think anybody ever invented a security called a bull\nUm but anyway I digress so\nLet me ask you the question\nFor I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a tip a treasury inflation protected security oh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CDs right now which are destroying right or interest\nAnd what I Want to do is take out enough money or I don't go over the limit at up to my Medicare\nPayments every year mhm with increases\nAnd I know it could go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my Ira between me and the wife\nAnd I don't want to have any additional ... oh I did I had the you know be paying to stay in other words what I read the areas that they do is take you don't have to report that to the state\nOr hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYes it is so have you done and analysis to determine that\nI had a really done it out but I think I probably have enough money stashed away that it probably going to be you know whether or not you know depending on how long outlive naturally and how long to wipe live\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just do real quick back or they're not gonna for what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of ...\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nOh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand aren't\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk and therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond a relative to a Banksy day I don't know if the difference is all that\nWorthwhile relative to the complexity these securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary bank CDs the difference in the fields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was wondering if it would have any effect\nI don't think it's going to be material enough that this is based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper or I could certainly argue that\nAll of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got an amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nAh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues we have an office in Cherry Hill not far from you and mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you\nBut that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing financially speaking I think you and your wife will be fine\nOkay okay so ... in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is and if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number and we'll connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and ah go from there okay that'd be fine\nAll right Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you very much you can do it Neal dead and cultural bleach plan wreck and it's really important that you put your investment strategy and the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication to your life getting into securities\nYou not really familiar with are accustomed to win the material differences in results are really not going to be there when\nIn fact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that's the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer nailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently focused on retirement and engaging in planning will you have enough money that's really the key question isn't it I mean if you were Bill Gates I don't think you care very much\nWarren Buffett I don't think he really needs is Social

perspective\nWe operate on a trust basis when you engage in a transaction when you buy any goods or services from anybody else you're trusting that they're going to honor their end of the bargain when you buy a house you know it takes three months right from the time you sign the contract of the time you close\nIt takes three months you have to do a search to verify the deed right you go to a title company and you've got to make sure that the seller really does own a house that the dean of the house is legitimate\nAnd that title search exists because well you don't trust the cellar and so you spend months and you spend thousands of dollars in a title search and you buy\nMortgage insurance you you buy insurance on the deed in case something goes wrong it at the time it adds money it doesn't do any real good doesn't increase the value of the house for example\nWell the block chain isn't authentication process it replaces the trust process with authentication under the block chain using this technologically on the Internet\nThe only way the seller can sell you the house is if they do in fact owned the deed and once they do the transaction on the Internet\nThere's no need for title insurance so the transaction can occur much faster and much lower cost and into lemonade the middleman and there's no way the transaction can be changed altered duplicated or delete it and this authentication process radically\nAnd rapidly makes improvements in the financial services sector let me give you an illustration\nIf you want to wire money overseas you've got to spend about eight percent in wire transfer fees and it takes five days for the money to show up and the other country\nBut if you do this with bitcoin you can do it in about ten minutes and it's virtually free\nSo a company like Western Union\nIs now under threat because they're no longer needed so when you were lemonade the trust and replace it with authentication you wouldn't lemonade the middleman you no longer need that trust company you know the longer need that title service company\nAnd as a result someone's out of work so the middlemen\nCould be disrupted as a result of the block chain and the

I'm\nCurrently we have the money just sitting in a custodial a savings account\nSo my question would be is should we leave the funds and that seems they count or treat moving into a five twenty nine plan which we are already contributing fifty dollars per month or should we invested in the market\nOr what ... what we've we've just covered two very different questions here I don't want to make
