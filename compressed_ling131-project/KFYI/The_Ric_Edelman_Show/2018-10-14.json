U.S and the five hundred to end the Dow Jones industrial average is about ten percent per year\nThat's assuming that you had a portfolio that consisted of nothing button that now who on earth is going to put a hundred percent of their life savings into the stock market I wouldn't\nI don't think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile outside class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering massive losses in a very rapid pace\nThat's why you only have part of your money in the stock market so up until Wednesday people have been saying\nHow on a I'm a I'm a I'm not I'm not doing as well as the stock market how come I don't have all my money and the stock\nMarket because the more diversified my portfolio is no worse it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else of course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really glad I don't have all of my money in the stock market boy I'm really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even might be performing better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditch the alternative instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day\nAt any given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks\nAnd it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us was something else that's really fascinating\nYou all know it's been going on with General Electric\nRight we've been talking about G E for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year GE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year wow really awful so far\nThis year gee is still in the ... five hundred but its stock performance in the S. and P. five hundred year to date fruit Tuesday ranked\nFour hundred and Ninety six best stock yeah out of the five hundred ... came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than gee you're the date\nBut as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that\nCompany but suddenly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else gee did fabulous and\nBecame the number one performing stock for the week through Tuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next is you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't the just the G anyone from among the worst\nTwo of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday if you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the ... five hundred were advanced micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nTo for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument or reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not in and of itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still humming along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're saying\nStop watching them lose it doesn't mean you should change your investment that means you should change much at all that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're still struggling on what you should be doing with your investments I had the number one piece of advice\nAnd I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back here

I'm Talking to you gentleman who are listening to the program right now\nYou know it it's really fascinating people are fixated on what's happening in the stock market this past week due to the

company that you just got back from Bangkok gemstone capital of the world [noise]\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the television show headmaster Troy, Michigan polls on the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option of taking a a lump sum pension briefly I've been given the opportunity to take on and what did your input on it\nSo ah the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter]\nSo that's a yeah it's like they're no reduce no do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing\nOf folks the good news is this it is straight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they are going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all it requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more cost effective more economic uh the the superior answer\nGiven the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great Australian our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases the sheer they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries [noise]\nUm so if you have a pension where were the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions as a fixed amount\nWhatever they're giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe ... the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension ... stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nUh so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major want his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce that you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given a lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know yourself you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manage it permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put it in a A R a\nYes assuming you're eligible in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy crate on your own\nAs I said usually the answer is yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good so\nYeah but then there's there's like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what you have this way and here's what you got that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nCarrie thanks for your question uh yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create further declines in the value of bombs now a couple of caviar to this\nNumber one yes the markets do anticipate\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the market's doing to dissipate that and they adjust securities prices based on that\nIn other words this is called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market is a leading indicator not a lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked in\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond will have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nThat makes sense the longer the duration longer the maturity date\nThe greater the swing and value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should probably not own long term bonds unless you plan to hold them to maturity if\nYou hold on a mature you don't have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity meaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time\nThen you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bonds in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year majorities rather than twenty and thirty year majorities of for that\nReason so yes you do need to be aware of this and this is something new and different for investors most folks are comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to interest rate risk\nFor the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates have pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment and not realizing that rates could go up not just down and they haven't been used\nTo the fact that bombs could lose value because for the past since Nineteen eighty that bonds are pretty much done nothing but go up in value because when rates go down bond prices go up or down a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question because a lot of folks at the very same question don't buy a bond unless you plan to hold up to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably own bonds in that funds that are shorter in maturity rather than longer\nAnd to know exactly what kind of bonds are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them you should talk with a financial advisor and we're happy to help you AAA to plan Rick to tackle that question for you here's another question and we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is\nIronic is Mick more prone to answer a question about terrorists we're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied to all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in price is for a number of the products that we can to purchase\nMy question is where does all that tariffs money go then it goes straight to the government coffers\nAs it is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick uh the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S and it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service and stuff\nSo yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers um\nIt's really that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and are there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it's receiving this helps to solve that problem but uh the burden is paid by American consumers\nWho a foot the bill so yeah that's what terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax revenue\nAnd the people who bought these policies back in the eighties and nineties will remember interest rates were back then\nInterest rates were much higher and the insurance companies were assuming that they were going to continue to earn those high interest rates and that's why they were able to charge a very low cost for the policies well guess what those high interest rates have come down the policy costs have gone up\nYou know for free without free retirement review yes you can get a free retirement review from one of the experience financial planners Edelman financial you'll get written projections

ask why we lost a lot of money in two thousand and eight and a lot of house values and those items haven't totally returned\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dallas pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it and yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo that's a sharp and the stock market the people who hold stocks or the people in the high income but it's so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have 'em in their stock values have gained and\nTheir stocks have gained Italian um but for the bottom two thirds\nOf households they really don't hold very much stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our most recent data trick two thousand and sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the\nPeak of the bubble a by two thousand sixteen but the house values are really high on the coach as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day and our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today they'd be a lot better off\nThe first fact as you pointed out as most people didn't own stocks at all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those seven panicked and nine sold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are camped values are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later\nThey haven't enjoyed the run up in value because they didn't hold onto their investment for having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat's right and and it's a lot of people lost their jobs the train a two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded that they withdraw the money's level of marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments [noise]\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and it has a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves that they won't outlive as one keep working longer the longer you work the more money you're adding to invest", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "14"}
