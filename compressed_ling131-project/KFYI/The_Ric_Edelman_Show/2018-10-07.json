Fox News [noise]\n\nHey guys running Shane Harris shame company I grew up in our store where my parents were my mom remembers me drawing [noise]\n\nAlso back to the Rick Edelman show we were talking in the last segment of apathy is Donna Xing amount of money the parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up line\nSixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement sixty nine percent of teenagers say they know little or nothing about financial planning well\nActually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you first of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem teenagers in fact\nAs we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving a car you might want to pull over as I give you this is historic one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [laughter]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs they don't understand how expensive cars are or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad you haven't told them a ... thing\nSo my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenagers stood alongside you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate in\nGames with them when the time you go talking about investments include them in the conversation your kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemics and uh oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet the last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that\nLast taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions in an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ask wreck\nAt ... dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago catcher has to say\nHi Ray cares Custer against from Brazil you seemed a little bit surprised with the fact that your shoulders to listen to all sorts of other us\nBut I think it really should that's because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about for when the case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do remember opinion when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification editor location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here as a shows that budgeting is not a very good use of so much time but wells take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight years old the older one is two years old the youngest one would go to a private school next year just like the oldest\nSo far as being able to save a little more a little above twenty percent of my income\nBut with this extra expense if I don't make any adjustments or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about tough as much of what I'm saving health\nAnd allowed I'd like to avoid it without any might I'm starting to work on my budget for two thousand Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in ... study I Can't do much about it\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distribution the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw and it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life if you wanted to do it\nOn a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you'll get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the count of the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ths with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name another IRA and her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but we separately care if any of those accounts\nWere for one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from my four oh one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw this is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money\nOnce every month the iris doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the town on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated the rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they are on\nYielding meaning if you try to complain to the tax court your love most likely going to lose that case so we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advisor\nNot only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or ... or omissions\nThis raises the question will the insurance company be able to honor the obligations that the company itself was not able to do I'm going to give you the advice that I've been giving you for years if you work for an employer\nThat promises you a pension you need to assume that the pension doesn't exist\nDon't assume that hey I got a pension and therefore don't have to say for my future wrong\nDon't assume your employer will honor its obligations don't assume you'll get as much money as they are promising don't assume you'll get money for as long as they're promising you need to save for retirement as though the pension doesn't exist\nFabulous great if you do end up getting the pension good for you nobody ever yelled at me because they ended up saving too much money you know what I'm saying so\nBe careful it's really the simple answer\nWhether you worked for a state or local government whether you worked for a union dare I even say you work for the federal government\nYou need to assume that these entities will struggle to meet their financial obligations obligations they cook decades ago under a very different economic environment in this nation a very different workplace environment than we have today are\nAnd if you have questions about your pension if you have questions about when to start your pension if you're being offered a buyout by your employer should you take it if you're wondering should you start your pension benefits in when you do should you take a single life only should you do a joint a life with your spouse should you do a term certain benefit\nHow should you take your pension it's a one time only decision once you make the decision you can't ever change it it's a big deal in other words\nCall us let us help you you've never faced this before but hey we have lots of times let us help you like we have a lot of folks just like you call us a triple eight plan wreck don't go the pension decision alone policy triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nLet me change the subject here I'm I'm broadcasting as I mentioned to you from San Francisco I'm excited to be here and guess what San Francisco is the home of the headquarters\nIs Fargo and so we can't have a edition of the show go by without talking about the latest of Wells Fargo\nTheir chief financial officer John ... said this past week that he expects business loans commercial real estate and commercial and industrial and stuff all\nTotal loans were down three billion dollars compared to prior quarter\nWhy it looks like a lot of people are unwilling to do business with Wells Fargo can't say I blame us regulators have just now rejected Wells Fargo is planned to repay customers who were pushed into buying unnecessary auto insurance\nRegulators are saying the bank must do more to make sure I'd find every driver who was affected by this the consumer financial Protection Bureau to see if the bay and the office of the comptroller of the currency the OCC\nThey say they need more assurances for most Fargo that they're going to do everything they need to find and repay everyone who was overcharged\nWells Fargo was doing was saying to people who got car loans that in order to get the car loan you must buy auto insurance from us even though people already had auto insurance elsewhere and then Wells Fargo dab of their bank accounts in order to get the payment on people couldn't pay the auto loans Wells Fargo in some cases\nCharge overdraft fees damage their credit and even in some cases repossessed their vehicles according to the CSP being the OCC this could involve six hundred thousand\nDrivers last year Wells Fargo said it would take sixty four million dollars to pay everybody back but lawyers representing the drivers say that's way too low a number\nMeanwhile the Justice Department is probing whether employees committed fraud in Wells Fargo spanking you that they want to know the Justice Department if management prompted employees to improperly alter add information of people's accounts\nThe Justice Department wonders if there's a pattern of unethical and potentially fraudulent employee behavior\nTied to management pressure\nWell along the way Wells Fargo has suspended two executives of federal probe in the purchase of low income housing tax credit is behind it a senior VP and another V. paid the Justice Department is investigating whether the bankers colluded with developers to submit low ball bits on tax credits\nWells Fargo by the way is the largest purchaser nine billion over the last five years of this tax credits and it's not just those two a VP that have been suspended wells has fired or suspended a dozen other employees at Wells Fargo securities\nAlleging that these individuals charged meals to the company improperly we're talking nine analysts and others from New York San Francisco and Charlotte think about that New York San Francisco and Charlotte\nThree incredibly different locations geographically suggesting this is a system white issue not something isolated to a local office\nWell due to all the above Wells Fargo says they're going to cut staff ten percent over the next three years\nAnd is it any wonder that it according to a new survey Wells Fargo staff or more miserable than at any time in the past three
