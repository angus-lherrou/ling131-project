they come from people that attempt Stephanie's workshops we certainly enjoy these now here's the deal\nThe first question comes from Susan in anthem Susan if you were sitting down with Stephanie Stephanie would have the opportunity obviously because you're sitting need a need to ask\nYou follow up questions and big a little bit deeper we don't have that opportunity here\nBut we always think of if Susan has this question there are others that are listening that might have the same question as well All right this question comes from Susan in anthem\nSusan says Stephanie I listen to your show for quite some time and\nI Know you talk about income a lot and you talk about different things retire you know retirement oriented obviously 'cause your retirement plan or what I really am concerned about is I'm not real sure if I understand how my my cost of living for example will change and retirement because you're talking about income a lot\nBut I Know my expenses now might be different ten Twenty years down the road how do I figure that out\nWell you know I think that this is a question that everyone should be asking actually because inflation is so so key you know one of the things that we do when when um we have folks come in we will sit down and we do a full analysis we have an incredible program that takes a look at expenses today\nExpenses tomorrow you know maybe you maybe house payment that you're paying that is going to be paid off in five or ten years how is that gonna affect your debt I always encourage our clients to try to get that free because I Believe caches king\nThe more cash you have the more is that you can join our retirement but you know we want to look at inflation inflation as I mentioned before the silent killer since laziness averaging just three percent\nKnow that in ten Fifteen Twenty years I mean Twenty years plus your extensive just dabble folks I can tell you Social Security is not going to keep up with that\nTitle inflation so

life has always changing circumstances change so\nThat's a great question you want to sit down and stuff you can find out more it's eight hundred nine four seven Ninety five twenty two next question Stephanie comes from Robert in Peoria and this is a great question because you touched on this earlier on in the program a little bit and congratulations Robert because why Stephanie you wonder he's got a pension\nSo here's a question Robert says Stephanie I just had the opportunity of getting close to retirement I'm gonna retire within a year or two but\nThe company has given me the option of taking the lump sum pension or taking the pension the way it was designed where I get the payout every month this seems to me to be a really big question I don't want to make the wrong decision would you help me\nAbsolutely I tell you I Do this all the times recently I'm One of the a couple of that I can think of right off the top of my head ear\nAs I sat down with me and they had like a three hundred and fifty thousand dollar lump sum or they could take it was like a twelve hundred dollars a month for the rest of his life this thing here is that it was only his life he dies it's gone\nSo what that means is that that three hundred thousand that he could take out as a lump sum is he has no control of that\nHis wife he dies for his his wife loses that twelve hundred not to mention she also would lose his Social Security is over fifty percent of their income was going to go away\nSo what we did is we ran the numbers we put together an income strategy that allowed him to take this lump sum we rode it over we began to do and I call it lottery\nLot earn an income strategy for him\nThat was actually just as much as he was being offered and that and mediate pay out that if he was to take it and stay with the company\nThat they ... they were going to provide for and we actually were able to need it match it an increase it over time and if he is the one that passes away first his wife will continue getting the same paycheck and I'm also going to mention this\nBecause I think this is so important um as part of the plan that we put together for him is that let's say that he needed some type of um home care or nursing home\nThe income plan that we put together for I'm actually doubles for five years to help offset those unforeseen expenses that could happen you know we just answer the question right before this when we talked about those unforeseen things that we don't know you know yes we always hope for good\nBut we also have a model here that we plan for the worst as well so please come in and sit down with us we can make these decisions very easy for you and show you the benefit\nBy taking them some taking control of that cash and putting it into your pocket you know there's just so much that we've talked about in this show that you know I think it's so important that people feel empowered when it comes to building their retirement plan I Can't emphasize strongly enough how important it is to be working with an ally\nSomeone that is a retirement\nProfessional I sit down so many ties with people that their advisors more concerned about um accumulating accumulating accumulating embrace risk risk growth growth growth that they forget the importance about putting a plan together to be given to\nBe more concerned about the preservation\nOf your retirement assets then risk getting it to grow\nSo today as I mentioned I think it's so important that you're working with financial professionals like ourself you know one that it's going to sit down and thoroughly goes through the process with you to put together strategies a well thought out\nPlan and the importance of knowing how and when to take it to simply call us right now at eight

and we're happy to to have you here and we're happy\nI'm happy that you aren't are representing me and my family that you're helping us through all of this stuff because you know with all of the tax laws I'm sure there's some good but I'm sure there's some things out there that people don't understand that that could cost him some money if they don't understand them\nAnd I think you know Ninety percent of our conversations together or more recently had been revolving around taxes and how do we take advantage of current tax law and the changes that have happened and how do we look forward and protect\nOurselves against more changes in the tax law well how do we do that you come and see us well that that is absolutely ... your\nYour overall picture and and and we create the strategy that that works for you based on your situation and you know you mentioned you and Vicki and you and Vicki of different situations and different plants\nRight Vicky is younger so hurt her tax planning on retirement planning is a little bit different than mine uh I Am at the age now where I could be drawing and am drawing Social Security almost wish I wasn't you know for me it's really not a benefit\nYeah I think ah you know it's it's a product\nOf overall situation with with taxes and with working and you chose to continue to work that's part of your retirement\nThose situations where you're trying to figure out you know what should go where and what is the big picture look like how is the next ten Twenty years going to map out oh that's really where we can offer the value\nSo so Jake is that five hundred thousand in the bank or could that be two hundred and fifty thousand equity in your residence and two hundred and fifty thousand liquid cash ... how does that shake out\nThe way our firm is set up is it actually is a five hundred thousand dollar invest double assets okay with that is what you would have actively in the market or out kind of being managed by a financial team\nOkay very good and I see the reasoning Joe behind that because again when you sit down with with well when you sat down with me we talked about a lot of different options and so um I have\nTo have the the funds to be able to fund those options are just as you were having conversations and\nThat's a great point you know but I think it's also important understand the community is important to us and and that's why we offer free consultations we've had plenty of instances where someone comes in and maybe they're invest blasted bases and five hundred thousand but we can give our feedback on that in and find the right professional for them in those cases\nYou're going hey we're getting ready to go to break but we are going to have joined Jake come back and if you didn't grab a pen or a pen so I really want you to do that for a next segment because they're going to give their phone number again and you you need to hear what they have to say Vicki take us out\nYou are listening to

a short break\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the cw I already old music\nMiss the comic performer\nJeeze and little bit of a little bit of asthma but I met the tail end of it now so we are good where we are good and uh we went on a business trip to Atlanta Georgia\nAnd what you said it wasn't the Atlanta pages that was the Atlanta pine trees that causes that's why I came back and the doctor said this September starts off asthma month no who knew All right let's get positive thing here I\nMean we've got Joe and Jake back with us they are with Arbor retirement solutions they're your retirement and tax experts and you know what you guys really are tired of it and tax\nExperts and uh you blessed me the day I met you and I don't even remember how that happened but but that was just a blessing in my life you blessed my ... when I met you because you did so much for me\nAnd I'm I was spending way too much money on products that we're not gonna benefit my retirement actually we're going to hurt my retirement and we sat down and you took a hard look and we've made some corrections and we've made some changes and boy what a difference you've made in my life and in the life of my family members and my grandchildren and I want to publicly say\nThank you thank you because you've just been great thank you grow we're happy to have you on board so\nLet's talk a little bit about the new tax law so there's a lot of stuff going on out there and quite frankly I don't sit and steady him\n[noise] and I really don't know I hear that Americans got a tax break but it doesn't feel that way to me yet so let's just talk about that joke\nYeah ... it's ... it's probably the most common question that we're getting today is how is the new tax law affecting your practice mhm and how is it affecting your clients um and you know we're seeing is\nThat there there are a lot of cases where there are tax breaks and um it's nuanced it's not it's not really simplification the way it's advertised ... but it is a new tax law and there's a lot a lot of new things to consider you\nKnow I was just going to say so I remember Paul Ryan saying that uh we could do our taxes on an index card so I'm hearing you say that's not quite the case\nSome people can our clients cannot okay um and you cannot\nSo if we so if you have a portfolio if you have investments if you have assets you need to see a professional tax preparer retirement expert\nIn sooner than later where I you know on the planning side um a lot of the the new tax law from two thousand December to Seventeen is still being the spills by professionals and ... and and so the end of the year the sheer so crucial because you know wants to separate thirty first passes your time\nThis is up for taking advantage of what might have been there in two thousand and Eighteen\nRight and you want to take advantage of those things and so so Jake what I understand too is is that a lot of the conventional things that we've thought about this kind of they've gone by the wayside their new practices and policies\nYeah there's a lot of traditional things out there that people are falling from the financial planning perspective and generally speaking you know there\nAre things to think about but it's not actually always the way that necessarily works the best for an execution standpoint especially like you highlighted if you're somebody that does have a portfolio and need some management and has a little bit of integration\nAre into their planning side um there's way more complex things so that you can do and there's way more powerful strategies that you can implement to not only benefits you while you're living but a benefit the family from a legacy standpoint which are no longer here\nWhich is again as you guys know my personal story which is very important to me like a C um I really am I I'm doing this so that I ... and my family can have a good life and I feel as a parent that is something that I should be doing for myself or my children and for my grandchildren\nAnd and I don't know if you know most people realize this because it's\nIt's usually kind of a light bulb moment when we mentioned it but we are in a historically low tax rate environment if we go back and look through the last hundred years while we're in a lower tax rate environment I didn't feel that way dies it it doesn't it doesn't ... to any of us it feels like ... but\nWith being in that kind of environment is it's important to ah you know look at the whole picture as you just said and say okay does it make sense for\nFor me to pay a little extra tax today so I don't have to pay any tomorrow no matter how the tax law changes in when we ask our clients and and new people that come in what direction they think the tax rates are going that's the light bulb moment 'cause they all say up\nYeah yeah it's like interest rates it's like a lot of other things it's like home prices things tend to go to get to go up and so and what what is the what is the answer to that when people say when you asked that question would you rather pay a little more today\nWhen when you distill the entire situation and say I think tax rates are going to go up if it's somebody that continues to work like you or someone with a lot of money in an an IRA you know a big part of their nest egg in a retirement account a lot of times that the solution is to say OK how can I\nPay a little more today but officially mhm so that I'm hedged against the government tomorrow and don't have to pay more tomorrow and Jake has a lot of experience with that as well\nSo what's the answer to that Jacob doesn't very\nUh absolutely everybody's situation is going to vary based on where their assets are held what types of accounts that they are held in but that's essentially what our job is to really gather and put the whole big picture together because you have to understand where the thing is that a from a high level overview before you can start up picking away at certain things\nAnd then we take that information and develop the most efficient plan that we feel is best uh to lay out for your retirement years and get you into a situation if you think taxes\nOr are you know even if you believe that they're lower now but they don't feel like you're paying anything lower now if they do go up or double over the next couple of decades think of what that will feel like then\nHorrible it'll it'll it'll just feel horrible and so one of the things that that I really appreciate appreciate about you Joe and Jake is\nAh your call me make your oh come on into the office and we'll sit down in your office and we'll have these big computer screens going and you you actually show me where I Am what our projections are what we need to be thinking about because even though I Am love retirement age I'm certainly not retired nor do I plan to be a [laughter]\nMaybe one of the [laughter] so it's ... so it's really important that planning no matter where you are in your life if you're forty years old you need to be thinking\nAbout retirement planning you just do\nYeah you you hit the nail on the head and and if you're thinking about it at forty you're going to be in a much better position when you're on the five and and your retiring no matter what retirement means for you\nThat's right and and I can just give you a personal story my sister is younger than I Am she and she called me and she said I was planning on living on Social Security because they really didn't put any money away I didn't say\nAnd uh I just said to her I Want you to take a hard look at what you do you need to call Joe and Jake even even though you're thinking you can live on Social Security when I take a look at Social Security I don't think if you want to maintain any kind of a lifestyle I think you can get by possibly\nBut you cannot plan on living on Social Security alone cannot\nYeah I mean we're already seeing a struggle for people that are at Social Security retirement age I mean the reality is every generation that gets younger and younger and younger has less and less of a chance of that being a reality from what we're talking about\nAnd this all comes back to the conversation of leverage that we're talking about earlier I mean you're relying on the government to be the one to bail you out so to speak pay pay you back what you paid in\nThat that may or may not be the case so or you know we are set out to continue to help ah clients maintain financial independence so that you're not worrying about that piece of your puzzle\nSo listeners again here here what we have to say if you're if you're sitting out here today and maybe you're fifty five maybe you're sixty maybe forty forty five you've got half a million dollars liquid assets\nAnd you're thinking I'm going to live on that I'll sell my house", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Carol Royse Real Estate Show", "city":
