Love this part yes I'm ready let's\nAll right so the first question comes from Robert in cave creek now Robert I Will say this we're sitting down need any with Stephanie and her team she can ask you questions you can ask her follow up questions bought we appreciate the questions because others may have the same question so I figure get more from these questions sitting down with Stephanie but we enjoy this\nFor sure so here's a question Stephanie comes from Robert in cave creek Stephanie is there a good rule of thumb for how much of my IRA should be invested in safe investments at this time period I'm sixty years of age or is it just a matter of personal preference to the recent market volatility has got me a little bit nervous but I'm not sure if I'm not taking on more risk than I should be\nWell I think that's a great question I could just give you the cookie cutter answer\nAnd I will but no it so there's in financial were all about customizing each person as individuals we just don't so are you in and nothing\nPot and said this is the rule of thumb because that's what a lot of broke our houses will do they'll take your age that's attractive from a hundred and then they'll balanced portfolio based on that number meaning\nThe higher numbers of your age is you know safe you're sixty the plus you know sixty percent they'll keep that more conservative more safe the other forty percent they would consider that they could to take on more risk that the cookie cutter formula that is not\nWhat I call a good plan so what we would do is we would sit down with you we would take a look at everything that you have\nAnd then what we would do is first we would address the income neat I've never well I shouldn't say never very I Can't recall a time that I've sat down with someone and Social Security and itself\nWas all that they needed to take care of them and retirement there's always been a need for additional income or cash flow because at that deficit whether it's because of inflation or they're doing more because let's face it Social Security was never intended to be so retirement plan so we'll take first what's needed\nFor income and make that contractually guarantee will make that safe\nThen what's the last year we will then as markets talked about today we will determine how much do we need to take care of medical issues how much do we need to keep it in the market to hedge inflation it's all about ballot so I'm not I'm not a cookie cutter\nI Would customize your portfolio to address your knees and your concerns\nRobert The number is eight hundred nine four seven Ninety five twenty two there is no cost obligation no pressure to sit down with Stephanie eight hundred nine four seven\nNine five to two and because we went along and her first or second was going to go to our normal three questions so Eldon in paradise valley I'm going to save yours for the next time we get together on this radio show so here's your final question Stephanie this comes from Laurie in Scottsdale\nMy husband and I are planning to retire in the summer of twenty Nineteen we've been working with an advisor for years we really liking my question is this when we talk to him about retiring it seems like nothing changes in his recommendations shouldn't we have different strategies in retirement than we do while we're working\nAbsolutely we look at this as maybe that last ten years before he retired as kind of a retirement read so we've heard it talked about before those are the years that is so important to begin to rebalance you are not alone in death\nSo many people come in and they do they like their advisor and their advisors done good and they've but the problem is they're not making adjustments for the next season in life retirement is a you walk into a season of preservation\nNeeded to take what you've accumulated it begin to protect it see our goal is to help protect it grow it a little and get some income that's true retirement looks like it's not that went into retirement and keeping it all in the market and hoping that the markets keep up\nWhat if they don't how is that going to affect you and retirement I Would say as much as you like your advisor you need to come in\nFor free second opinion it never hurts to get a second opinion there still obligation we won't charge you know pressure simply a second opinion can make all the difference when it comes to your retirement so why don't you pick up the phone today and give us a call at eight hundred\nNine four seven nine five to\nNine five to tail and mess\nCase or or maybe you've had a had a real estate agent who told you you know it's the holidays it's got to slow down why don't you wait until January no don't do that I don't do it don't make that mistake because that could cost you thousands in the end\nPick up the phone and call me Carol rice for eight oh seven seven six five two three one will come out no obligation give you an accurate information on what your home is worth and today's market\nWhat you're going to that at the sale at the closing of the sale of your home and how many days we estimate is going to take us to get your home sold\nSo Vicki why don't you go on to your report your luxury report they were going to pop back in with Joe ... of next a mortgage\nOkay so all data is compiled from the Arizona regional multiple list service servicing Maricopa ... counties currently there are one thousand five hundred and twenty four luxury homes for sale price from one million to a high of twenty six million the current average price luxury for sale home in the valley to point three million\nWhat stays on market averaging a hundred and eighty seven so that was the homes that are listed for sale mhm under contract in escrow these homes have buyers on um there are two hundred and thirty two luxury homes price from one million too high of seven point five million the average price luxury home in escrow\nIn the valley one point seven nine million with stays on market averaging a hundred and sixty one\nOkay Carol here are the numbers that really matter this is what has closed escrow Irish have moved into the homes\nSo we had twenty eight luxury homes clothes and I am a less than last week show that numbers down it is quite a bit down actually close escrow price from nine hundred and Seventy five thousand to a high of three point two million the\nCurrent average price so luxury home and our valley of the sun right now one point six seven million with average days on market a hundred and eighty nine so that's a little more than six months yeah taking since the first of the year\nWe have had one thousand five hundred and eighty four luxury homes close escrow now we're up on that number but just recently as of this week we did see a slow down and our numbers we did so the highest price luxury home in our analyst that closed escrow since the first of the year Seventeen point five million\nMhm mhm that's right so what what we're saying is is that our market is still moving but days on market have increased\nAnd we are seeing price reductions and whenever I see days on marketing increase in price is going down that tells me that the market is getting a bit sluggish it doesn't tell me that the market is stopped we're certainly not seeing anything like we did in those seven eight or nine\nAnd my dad he won't and we will those days are over but here's what we know agents selection matters\nMore today than ever because the house has to be priced right it has to be in show condition but more than that Vicki you need to work with an agent that has buyers because you need to get buyers and the house\nAnd when I was looking today on our website we do have Ninety two hundred buyers that that we're talking to in our website NATO Ninety two hundred are looking for a high end home they're all different price ranges and time frames but most agents\nOut there don't have buyer's they take your your listing\nThey ... they walk out to their car and then they begin to think oh my gosh what am I going to do to find a buyer how am I going to find a buyer and they begin to do the traditional things they put the home and the multiple list service they make a fancy flyer\nOr they take some photographs and then they sit and wait for somebody else to bring a buyer we ... we are so proactive we do not do that right Vicki that's right we do not do that we get your home immediately out to our buyer pool to see if anybody in our by our pool is\nIs interested in it we have a city wide network of people that we work with we get it out to them immediately and we start\nLooking we we get your house in front of buyers immediately yeah immediately\nUm that's important um why why would we just try to go find that buyer after we take your home I'm In ... instead we want to build on the buyer's we already have that's important to you why because we don't want to waste those precious days on market we all know that dates on market as they start running on these homes\nUm can cost can cost a home seller allowed any fast right and so we try to do everything to hedge against that versus taking your home right into our him and try and and launching it into the M A lesson and trying to figure out a plan what to do later\nSo if this is something that interests you pick up the phone and call me Carol rice for eight oh seven seven six five two three one you could always go to my site Carroll has\nThe buyers dot com and and remember we do have the buyers we are your valley wide team and we are the team that has the buyers your home may already be sold pick up the phone and call me Carol rice\nFor eight oh seven seven six five two three one and Vicki when we come back we're going to take a short break and we're going to have Mr joke for us to deal with next a mortgage with us\nWe're going to talk a little bit about interest rates the market and what you can do if you're thinking about buying a home\nThat's right you have been listening to Carol race rotate show right here on five fifty KFYI we're here every Sunday afternoon from two to three PM pick up the phone give Carol call today for a NATO seven seven six fifty two thirty one that's for eight oh seven seven fifty two thirty one\nIf you're thinking about buying selling your Arizona real estate we'll be right back after the break and we'll be talking with Joe for the next the mortgage\n[laughter] I don't know\nAbout that\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nThey're buying attraction one ...\nEvery Sunday afternoon today I'm In the studio with my partner Vicki ... how are you hello I'm doing great that I've done a after it is a beautiful\nSunday afternoon and we've got Mr Joe proceed with Nixon mortgage in the studio with us today hello Joe ... or ... or ... and listened Joe you heard Vicki an eye on the last segment just talking about the market the real estate market in general across the country that is slowing down\nA the Arizona market we're seeing that too although not as severe as in some other cities but we're still seeing a little bit of a slow death so buyers might think well gee I'll just wait ... maybe we'll have another two thousand seven\nI don't think that's going to happen and what is your take on new door if I'm not going to happen\nNo but when we say a slow down what we mean by that Vicky is that we're seeing a little longer days on market we are and we're seeing a few more price reductions we are and we're not seeing as many multiple offers\nThat's right so basically what we are seen as a you know in some states\nThey were having fast ramp it appreciation for the last few years those states they're going to have a correction\nArizona on the other hand we weren't going at a healthy ... increase in price and now you're just seen a little bit of a a a slowdown but it's not going to be anything massive it's not going to be anything like what we saw in the past so don't worry about that\nWe're still in a pretty healthy real estate market here we still have jobs coming to the valley we do we have sunshine more importantly climate and we have\nUm we really don't have the national\nDisasters no so Joe what what advice would you have for a homebuyer what advice would you have so maybe they're kind of sitting on the fence what advice would you have\nParts of the first thing I Would recommend for ... to do is\nGet a second opinion and and the ... before I came to an extra mortgage or which by the way my animals are the numbers one six six or seven to were legal yeah I'm going to do or what I was just going to do is literally call you a second opinion was with not just one wonder maybe to lenders and this is the reason why\nA copy of the driver's license or we need a trucking and savings accounts ... so we can just when we got to verify were that don't permit money's coming from whether it's strictly on sale of their home or their habits and for one there's multiple options\nBut really if you do what do you do a pre qualification over the phone or just try to find out who the fire is ... what are their goals were those dreams and how can I help them the best right\nYeah that's good so so they should try to get this stuff get ...\nThey could if you have to W. twos other tech statements ... known information or when you're a copy of their driver's license best basically the owner you know will be a perfect system appointments with a ... worth of work and how much money they're actually making\nA that's the basic needs was a front a based off that information to turn around and figure out what they could afford\nAbsolutely and that's a very important thing before we go to break up you know it's it's important for us when we work with a homebuyer to know where they are comfortable and buying a home that's right and we can't even submit an offer without a pre qualification but seller would accept an offer that was submitted without a buyer pre qualification if\nThat was high qualification goes along with the Arizona purchase contract and so if you're thinking about buying a home reach out to us today ... throughout the east valley for eight oh seven seven six fifty two thirty one remember ... the agent with\nThe buyers Europe valley wide team we service the entire valley from the west side to the east side from the north of the valley to the south of our pick up the phone and call me for eight oh seven seven six five two three one we'll see you after the break\nHey it's my ... when it comes time to sell your home you want to make sure you hire the right realtor that can get top dollar and get your home sold fast do\nTo you from downtown Phoenix and beautiful KFYI studios and what a gorgeous October we had Vicki whether cool down a little bit although it popped up a little bit\nThis weekend but you know you can see the blue sky the puffy clouds and the winner grasses in and everybody's yard is looking emerald green and\nAll that rain my hat is yes what an odd at my job or I mean we've hit records [noise]\nI Know Vicki called me one day and from her how she said it is hailing like crazy and raining at my house I went outside and the sun was shining\nYeah it's just been kind of silly that well they just given an emergency broadcast for nine saying move your cars inside hail is coming and they gave the locations and I'm like oh my gosh I haven't ever heard something like that so that was kind of\nMedical cut yeah so I didn't know Vicki you've been studying the market and you've got some recent stats let's just talk about that to give our listeners a bird's eye view of what's going on in our local real estate market\nYeah so basically I'm this data was for September two thousand Eighteen 'cause we always kind of look back a month when we do these\nUm what's going on in the metro Phoenix area of the valley so here's what the numbers are saying sales are down ... points to ... the markets so Vermont\nThe year over year comparison is also down ... at five point nine percent so monthly sales are running around\nSix thousand eight hundred and Ninety seven homes that are in our in ... Arizona multiple a service that's where all the inventory is a new and tore Carol it's\nEight point six percent month over a month well year over year comparison decreased by five points six per se so here's\nWhat I hear you say so inventory is down because not as many homes are coming on the market do I hear you say that\nCorrect but ... coming on the market but let me talk about total him and tore have total inventory has a month over month increase of one point nine percent while year over year reflects\nA decrease of seven point four percent so what's happened yeah and it's happening we've had a little bit of slow down of new properties coming on the market mhm but the human tore that's been on the market has been slow down on sales it has\nSlowed down on says so here's Vicki just here's what I hear and all of that and and that's are important but here's what I hear your house needs to be priced right absolutely and you needed rice right and so many times you know a solar will tell me well I don't want to give my house away and I respond back to them\nWell if you're giving your house away there would be a line out the door people trying to pick it up so\nSo when we give you advice on the market and and who sets the market I don't set it no the ... virus at the market so when we give you information on the market um if you if you listen to what we're telling you were were telling you the truth\nAnd if you're pressure house accordingly\nWill get it so for you and that right and and not give away your equity\nWe are so on purpose of not giving away your hard earned equity we will price that house fairly according to the market we will negotiate on your behalf so so that you don't have to come way down and and to accept an offer and will communicate with you effectively\nThat's right so here's another set some months of supply of him and tore in August with two point four seven\nNow moving into September it jumped up to two point nine three so it's going to be interesting when I take a look at these numbers next month and see how September I wouldn't be surprised if we get into the you know over three months and that even tore\nSo average new list prices are up\nEight percent year over year while the year over year median is that five point seven percent the prices are up prices your hair yes the average sales prices up eight point eight percent year over year while the year over year median sales prices also upset okay well let's say ... so that's good news correct\nAbsolutely so an increase\nIs forecasted in October for average sales price while no changes expected in the median sales price in October okay let's see ... anything we're going to get an ... but we're going to stay steady at at you know medium price point\nFor foreclosures are pending over a month of or month showed an increase of two point seven percent people\nIn distress that can't make their payments were seeing that that's coming up a little bit but again he are nothing back\nBy not on a ... so right and so basically through September we saw two thousand six hundred and twenty two distress properties so now I mean like the numbers and we saw back in the day we saw that daily\nSo distress sales accounted for one point four percent of total sales up from the previous month of one point three percent short sales however dropped\nThirty five point two percent year over year lender own sales drop thirty six point four percent year over year so we are seeing that type of stuff\nUm days on market has dropped um for days now so I'm well month of or month increased by one day so we are seeing you know an increase on our average days on market\nWe are is go ahead this is the information straight out of our um all that so any property that was listed in the MLS and it sold these are those numbers from that source\nThat's right and so here's here's what let's just let's just put this in plain English\nIf you're home seller don't wait to get your home on the market don't wait until January or February and no matter what you've heard get your home on the market now\nAnd you'll beats a crowd because we know what happens in January is everybody rushes to get their home on the market and there's all of this new inventory that you have to compete against and you're just get lost in the crowd get your home on the market now if you want to take it off the market from December\nFifteenth to just to January first were okay with that will do that but get your home on the market now there is no benefit to you not to do that\nSo another thing I Want to mention about this is you know you get the people that that want to wait Carol but what do we know impacts pricing more than anything what\nInterest rates oh my God yes so you might be my Dallas ending to this going but I'm hearing that they're saying things are slowing down a little bit and there's got to be more ... rates will impact your payment more that it hurts his price so so maybe if you think he might be able to save five thousand dollars\nOn the price you're actually get a pay more with the higher interest rate so Joe so right now I mean our time yeah\nSo so maybe they'll say five thousand dollars on a purchase price works but their interest rate\nGoes up a quarter of a percent have they saved anything no cost thousands and thousands of dollars because alone that's exactly right because if you do a loan for Thirty years and Vicki\nLast week Joe shared with us that most Arizona homeowners stay in their house for ten years they don't stay thirty they say ten but but that interest rate hike even over a ten year period ... it'll it's going to cost thousands of dollars if you are not\nGoing to save any money at all it's going to cost you money a lot of money\nA lot of money and so you know I I Know that the president has been on the fed a little bit saying don't raise interest rates but I'm the trip and it'll happen going up there going up\nEvery ... to redo your price increases or leave 'em or do you notice is a river of Detroit and a ... different things but the bottom line is what you mentioned the roots are going\nYeah so so do it now give us a phone call pick up the phone call me Carol rice for eight oh seven seven six five two three one you can always go to my site Carroll has the buyers dot com I Am the agent with the buyers I Am ... valley wide real estate agent no matter where you live and you can hear my voice I\nCan sell your house and Vicki a we have a team of dedicated professionals that work with us it's a matter of fact
