will run out of money as they advance an agent Stephanie a huge piece of this retirement income puzzle is Social Security\nSince we're focused on making our income last over the course of a long retirement what suggestions do you have for taking her Social Security benefits\nWell first of all this is important because you've got a manager Social Security benefits wisely people approaching retirement age to carefully carefully carefully consider when to start taking Social Security payments you know they could opt out um and they could start payments as early as sixty two\nAnd if they don't need that income immediately it's often in their best interest of the late payments at least at least until full retirement age now that's going to depending on the ear of birth sixty six or sixty seven when they become entitled to fall are what's called an reduced Social Security benefits\nNow if you really truly want to know how to maximize your Social Security then you're going to delayed intel say such an age of Seventy\nBecause you can earn more money by delaying it\nAnd it it does make a big difference but here's the thing I think is so important that you seek out a professional when dealing with this type of information\nSomeone that has the experience on how to help people create a strategy for Social Security because everybody's different everybody needs to take it a different places there's over three hundred plus lays on how to take Social Security and making this decision once you make it it's it's their reversible you can't change it mark\nYou know in another part of that healthcare costs will certainly be if you need long term care and now there are so many more options out there that you walk your clients through Stephanie than just

big chance at one of you is going to need some\nType of care some way are somehow or not that I can tell you I I Need to be clear about this I don't like long term care insurance\nNow this is what I mean by that just simply just to go out and get a long term care policy and pay a lot of money for something that you may or may not need\nIt's just it's frustrating as going out and having to buy a car insurance now we're happy if we thought we got the insurance if we need it but here's the thing\nLong term care insurance in itself here's a danger number one but if you never use it you lose it you just that thousands of dollars number two I Would say at least Ninety five percent of the policy is out there have what's called rate increases\nAnd they see that happen to older we get the more expensive it becomes in some cases many times when people come in to visit me me they will show me if they have a long term care policy what they have\nMark they can't even afford it anymore here they pay thousands and thousands of dollars and they can't even afford it so it's very crucial to understand that long term care coverage is important and there are ways that you can do this and not have to pay\nThe high extensive causes that people are paying to keep a policy but that's why it becomes important that you're sitting down with someone like ourselves that understand all of the ... of

where your retirement dreams began with forwards and financial planning we're talking about what happens if you live to the age of one hundred and speaking of longevity Stephanie we're about to run out of time on the program today\nBut before we do about one more key to addressing longevity risk so that our income will last even if we do live to the age of one hundred\nBut you've got to take an approach that first of all that it starts with a plan don't go into retirement blindfolded don't go in with the whole upset that the markets continue to do good you'll be okay let's plan for the what ...\nWhat is the absolute worst happened\nToday right now think about it where you are right now\nWhat if the absolute worst happened how is that going to affect your current plan because that's what we do at Fullerton financial\nWe begin to take an investment approach and we take a look at what is it how do we ... put things into place to ensure that you're not going to run out of money and

[noise]\nDo they understand\nHow they put in front of you how much income you're going to need to support your retirement because they have it then you deserve to be confident about that and that's why you're going to want to\nTake up your phone right now I now pass this offer the among the ten people right now that will receive a whole retirement costs and my plan by simply calling eight hundred\nNine five to two\nWe study this were were students of the tests where students and uh so it you don't think of these things as I kinda whenever thought like a few words a description on my house matter but\nWe have those keywords that matter how people will find you and how people look at you and how do the do either\nWell who's finding its first of all let's just let's just break that now it's the buyer is the bar it's the buyer so they're coming on line and they're looking at houses and if there's two or three words to him and the description of that house that the buyer doesn't relate to\nOr can't they can pick so we don't need a lot yeah here's the thinking in the ... the thinking is this is how people in other coming on looking at me their sin lifting or seen the full\nYou know there there possibly choosing me here's what buyers are doing\nThey're looking for ... yeah they're looking for reasons to de select you not ... that's right yeah so that ... all of that fine line that we're talking about that find sand and in this hour glass or we're sifting through it matters that huge\nBecause people are not going on to find you to come and see the virus reject yeah buyers looking at you for reasons\nNow ... I wanted to tell you a quick story I I was called out at a beautiful property in a gated community and it had been on the market with another agent for seven months and I looked\nI looked at the comments and when I walked into the house it said it was a seven ... seven bedroom house Tim it was a five bedroom house the agent ... has said that that Dan was a bedroom and there was a huge game room upstairs that the agent said was a bedroom\nNo wonder buyers didn't didn't select that house that the den with not mention and had beautiful built ends in it and the game room which was big enough for the pool table and law and and and big screen TVs what's\nCalled a bedroom yeah so right then and there would rather have a seven bedroom home or a five bedroom home with the game room and a den yeah exactly so things like that rape point\nI'm ... and folks let me tell you they will do select you to photos will so the read your description if it's not in line with your photos but you gotta do select it it's just\nThat this was um what would you that it's easy and people think oh this is you know simple this is not simple stuff so you have to think how buyer thinks right make sure you don't get\nThese selected so I'm Glad we talked about than photographs positioning of photographs critical critical um because it's got a flowing and you've got to have the right ... you know your elevation and all that's got to be just perfect spot on the orientation and even you know the captions all that have to have to be spot on so\n... this is something that we used to go ahead for hey hey Josh\nAt one of the things that you do is when we take listening into our inventory you do something called a three D. video yeah and when does when you do the three D. video what does that do to that property\nWell basically one sided with really video the property tends to get a lot more exposure um people can actually go and look at the three D. video and it'll give them more of a understanding of how to access the house they can go room by room it's basically just a bunch of panorama stitched together to really give you a feel of the house\nGive you a feel of the house so it is a walk through the house and to him that he has really been important for for our homes because again we strive to position\nOr homes yeah and even some of these are sites that were on we run over three hundred and sixty seven sites out there uh the buyers used on a debt puts as to when we have those three D. size right Joshua puts us to the top of their list and the search criteria right exactly um ...\nYeah it's a huge thing and we really want and we call it exposure boy we want to get that home to our buyer pool immediately immediately we want to do some marketing immediately immediately and\nThen when we do put it on all of these sites we want to make sure that everything is done every I's dotted anti has crossed I think that's what you're saying to him and that his position proper\n... its position property even as you know the details of sign in the yard you know most U.S companies are just about every one of them they have one sign they just have a front sign out there it's got a number of album number so number sometimes you can barely read the numbers sometimes\nUh you know we do more than that yeah we we have we position to science or we want to know what buyers coming up to that house pulling that fire off that sign as a secondary sign it's called house top called ... talk and then we all also have a great description of bought that house explains that house\nAnd uh how folks can find us to get in to show your property right away and that's that's truly what happens folks will buyers will drive up to check out your your check out your neighborhood check out you know the park across street whatever the the humidity's around the neighborhood and then\nIf they're interested they'll go in and see it but they will drive you first in many cases right girl\nThey will and house talk is really easy and Josh is in charge of that and it's like a talking commercial in front of your house on the buyer's smartphone what an ingenious way\nTo to market home Josh it's so much better than than the old way technology is brought us a long way hey listen we're running out of time on this segment but we do want you to come back because
