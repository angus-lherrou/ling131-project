what we do every day\nIt certainly does and hey we've got a very special guest with us today we want we want to get right on to that in this event Meyer an event is with home old Republican protection hey how are you today how are you a very good good and so how are things that in the home weren't the business oh you know what now that summer is over [laughter]\nYou can have a little bit today I mean uh yeah these contractors really really work really hard um they're on call almost twenty four seven during the heat of the summer constant ac issues that's why people purchase the warranty is to cover that you know\nOkay let's it up yeah you just exactly so if you're listening and you don't know what old republic home to the action is Yvette explain what it is\nWell ... are designed to cover the major systems in the home so it's going to be your plumbing electrical air conditioning and heating\nAnd built and appliances within the living space the home and the garage due to come and wear and tear that includes you know air handlers compressors condense or his entire to ten package unit that includes\nCertain girls so Vicki so and so it's not just a waste of money has not frivolous that is something that everyone should have on their home be it if you're home seller or you're just you're just a home owner ah why why spend four hundred dollars to replace a microwave six hundred dollars to replace a dishwasher race for itself\nAnd and the air conditioners oh my gosh it's more than pays for itself and so if you put\nAn old Republican warranty on your home or do you do it for one year venue re knew it event ... going what we send your renewal notice and you can just keep renewing from their correct that's good so if if you had several things that went on in that year do you ever disqualify him\nIt's got to be pretty extreme at that point and then you would need to get me involved we do operate the industry not just so republic operates like an insurance industry so we do have to do an evaluation of you know is this going to be a huge just continuously loss to where we can't serve is are there for the most\nPart at our clients come back out ever give that feedback so I think it's very ...\nPlus plus the Carol race team pulls a lot of string suing saying it was Carol who referred\nYeah so you have been lifting the car race real estate show right here on

with another rage and it didn't so here's what you should do call my real ... about the\nPurpose of this show that Carol race real estate radio show is to bring you accurate\nInformation on Arizona real estate and I am in the studio today with my partner Vicki various middle Brooke hello hello there Mr Vicki and today again we're going to continue with Missy that Meyer and ... is with old republic a home protection\nAnd ... we were just talking on the break at at wipe platinum is such an important plan so if you're listening out here today\nAnd you think gee I'd like to have a home warranty from my home because it makes sense\nAnd you give that a call and you mentioned the Carol rice team that might be the key to getting a home warranty today is the mentioned the ... team event is going to talk to you about the platinum plan any vet ... the reason for that for the most part is because of retrofitting\nCorrect the modification that plant and that plan was developed as the need is the need warranted it itself in terms of the ... we saw that the new units the fourteen a unit schooling and\nWere heavier and larger and we're going to require modification modification has been something to modify for ... you're talking about air conditioners and water and water heaters so anything in the home but basically those too expensive systems\nA modification has never been covered before in the past ... years through home weren't the homework T industry so we developed this platinum plans and um and I'll just explain the importance of it you know my mother's own a home in look good and I ... a a few weeks ago her water heater\nA went out it is in a patio in a tight space in a closet\nThey came out the new water heater was not going to fit because as we know the new water heater sent out four to six inches wide or in space the installations built in the water heater and it was a west coast a\nMandate through the government for energy efficiency purposes so the bottom line was they had to um a retrofit for eight tasteless and the contractor was at the house from nine thirty to for thirty given the job it was a thirty four hundred dollar job eleven hundred of that\nWas modification now when I bought the plan many years ago we never offered platinum and as I renewed it I\nCompletely forgot to upgrade it I didn't pay attention and so on the eleven hundred of the modification yours truly had to pay so the moral of the story is this if I had platinum ended upgraded that plan platinum covers a thousand a modification so I Would have been out the difference\nOf a hundred that the plant didn't cover\nAnd the Seventy five dollar co pay versus the eleven hundred I had to pay and still they saved me a boatload of money over two thousand but I still had to pay that so that platinum plan pays for itself ten times over what the AC in water heater roughly over\nFive hundred dollars or thirty five Seventy five\nDollar difference ... yes and they called her a hundred dollar yes yeah so that's why she was saying earlier in the show you know go with the platinum don't try to save Seventy five dollars up front actually because it'll actually cost you thousands in the\nAnd that was just one job and to my knowledge still we're the only who weren't to company offering that with\nThat thousand a modification I think there is one of their homework to come in only covers two hundred a modification it's a moot point modifications are extremely expensive\nSo here's what we're talking about if you if you notice where your hot water heater is many times there in a closet in a closet in a garage and a closet on a patio mine is in a closet in a garage and then uh that the hot water heaters are smaller back in the day\nI mean my I have a smaller hot water heater I was looking at the last time you were on our show a vet and so I Know that if that water heater goes out and I have to replace it it's not going to fit I ended up ... to retrofit it for ... that's right and so if I have the platinum plan on my house and that hot water heater goes out\nCovers a thousand on the modification ... usually absorbs like I said it was only a hundred short of what I Need it with my mom's job that old\nYet that modification is covered and then the new hot water heater can come in there\nBecause again if you will look Mr and Mrs home owner go look at your just this is just one small example go look at your hot water heater and if you think that you can go to Home Depot and buy hot water heater for three or four hundred dollars and install laser on phase are over they are gone and the same thing is that with\nACC is we are all of that\nNo you know there there were our insurance the refrigerant now for our twenty two most all our systems are twenty two is tripled in cost okay to that the canister used to be sixty five dollars it's now eight hundred ... any homework to companies are charging per pound they've got a pound or dollar limit over public so far does not have a pound or dollar limit that\nCould save every time we go out to charge the with refrigerant that could save four to six hundred dollars above your client writing a check which is huge\nBut the modification what they see and it's just keep in mind the rule of thumb\nOld home the older the property the the the the tighter the space I'm the more modification is going to be necessarily ... air handlers compressors condense or you name it if it's a rough mounted unit more modification older the older the home the tighter the space the older the unit\nThat's what's going to require more modification so Vicki for five hundred dollars\nYou as a a list as one of our Carol racist or this is a benefit for you listening to the care where it's real estate show on Sunday afternoon you are going to have access to that and to old republic\nOh homework T and I'm going to give you an event phone number and you need to take it down and you need to call her if you've got questions she is a little happy to answer your question you can reach her at eight hundred\nFor four five six nine nine nine and that would be extension one two four six that's the ... with old ... public home protection this is serious stuff yet this is serious stuff yes we're talking about saving homeowners shoot ... lions\nAnd and they've got to keep in mind again those that are just came in and started listening when they think oh my homeowner's insurance you're homeowner's insurance did Dr bowl is at least five hundred are deductible is Seventy five dollars this is the difference between bridging the gap between home warranty an homeowner's insurance\nAnd I tell you how many ties a homeowner insurance policies will tell our clients oh you know we're not going to cover that clean ... and so you know the the folks are out of pocket so home warranty is totally different than home owner insurance I Know you need both\nYou need both you absolutely do I I just want to bring up Joshua column who is our digital marketer and who just bought a home from us and\nAnd Joshua ... one of the things that you insisted was old republic and a home protection plan and and Joshua has used it for his heating and air conditioning I Believe he's used it for his pool and I believe is used it for plumbing probably\nUsed it for his kitchen sink which was having um a plumbing problem and so he's he'll say to me um he is my son your grandson and he'll say mom I just put in a order online for old republic they're coming out you know\nTomorrow or today and um without that I don't think I Would have peace of mind with him having that home because I Know that he's got that back\nUp because he doesn't have thousands and thousands of extra dollars sending around Rick I'm to do these repairs\nYes no and it's so important it is so important and and that again is that\nWhen the ... team when we formed partnerships\nWith vendors it it's they've got to have the same values that we have\nThey they've got to operating under the same principles that we operate under wraps and we have I Will tell you that our relationship with you mhm and with old republic has been a blessing Oh thank you listen to our team and a blessing to our homeowners and and our home buyers\nThat because you have saved them literally hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years that we've been in partnership with you and yet old republic\nWell we appreciate being aligned with such a professional team I mean you're a legend obviously", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Carol Royse Real
