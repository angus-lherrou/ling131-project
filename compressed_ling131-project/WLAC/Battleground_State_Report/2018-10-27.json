I don't ever so we didn't move because I have a two and a half percent interest rate on my house that I got when the when the when the rates were super super low so I'm the guy contributing to the problem in in our economy will not selling houses but I don't have an assumption feature on that but if I had a loan that ad that who do you think would want to buy my house with a two and a half\nPercent interest rate I mean it would be the more it would be workable deal so I Do think we are going to see that\nComing or is that something that if water stoned to death and somebody says hey I Want assume I'm gonna buy Andrus house I'm going to assume her loan [noise]\nDo you ... do you do deserve the mortgage company facilitate that nowadays because back in the day it would come through us but is that something that the mortgage company facilitates\nYeah honestly Andrew asked me this the other day and I said you know what I Know that there's some some clauses in the mortgage is but you know clients ever asked me ...\n... ... or ... or ...\nThe government stuff is the conventional stuff nine and Ninety nine Ninety nine times out of a hundred year conventions are not going to be unless you have some sort of niche program that does happen assembly clause in it but just like end and I talked about you still have to qualify and you you mentioned did as well you still have to qualify as just that\nYou know you've got to get a release of liability and if you don't know what that is what that means if Michael I bought your house and I assume you're alone and you didn't get a release a liability hook and I quit than you are on the hook my friend me and I don't know many I always tell people I'm like if you're actually going to\nEver consider doing this the first thing you need to figure out to do is can you get the release of liability that\nBecause if you can't get that it doesn't matter if there was there's no way I Would trust anybody to continue to make those payments would and then I have to be responsible\nFor it and that's going to come down more than likely is going to come down in my opinion to each individual investor whoever's back in the loan and will they give it to you with us\nNow is that an investor or the the service or standpoint or is that like a da or an F. A. J. who makes that decision\nBoat but I mean it's going to be normally your investors going to do it because I mean ultimately it's all gonna funneled through the Geneva ... coupon platform where all government loans are back but you've just got to get the really if you don't have the release and it's like you said I'd love to know what the percentages are those are handed out like as he she called and I was like you know who she called\n... how are you said you shouldn't shot that you mentioned called somebody now I mean I Am in Fifteen Years I never had an affair had somebody on that we're going to learn because I'm going to try to when I Do I Love to know what every ... of of of actually hand than those get out of jail free\nCard on that stuff 'cause that would make a huge difference if your market in the house to say hey we can do it but I don't think that people are going to get to release didn't so\nYou know I'll make a note and all that you know like when they're apartment to see how many of our loans have been assumed the last ... years period two years three years to see what they tell us\nYeah and it and then er and then release a liability to ya\nI'm asked I Would I Would definitely ask about that if he got me interested to see because I don't disagree that we're going to be seeing some of that if if rates continue to climate as the government stops buying these bonds and they come back out into the into the open market\nI Do think the right they're going to ... we're going to see continue increases and some of the rates because the government is no longer backing the bonds get like they have done in the past where\nThe back and um they're just not buying buying them and the right they weren't directs are now let me ask\nYou this didn't feel a little drop this week last week it's go home\nAt your nightly news and watch the ticker at the bottom of the TV show about the new show\nAnd it's up and down every day every week same thing as I got as the bonds stock market does well bonds will increase their yield and that pushes rates down when all the market did bad right now all of a sudden you've got people pulled him our money out of the stock market put into bonds\nThat how it is so it's it's really a funny thing because you almost have to hope for bad things happened in the world to really screw up with stock the stock market and get people to pull money out of stocks and put into bonds but we're getting away deep and that kind of stuff but I mean it's it's one of those things of\nBonds I got thirty or thirty year more so it's going to take you Thirty years possibly the make this money back so you have the returns not as good but it's but it's a solid fairly stable return that you're going to get back and just takes longer as opposed to the stock market where you could possibly trade quicker\n[noise] making them making investment and make a return quicker and and make more money faster to do it but it's more risky or to do that which is why they kind of play off each other so much is is one of the longer term safer investment with a lesser return\nAnd you put that in just like layman's terms real quick or for just anybody's listening to science or was that was\nGood but it was right and bring it back home real quick\nI\nSaw her eyes forget it [laughter]\nSo you're listening to this\nAnd you're wondering okay what what uh Chris just say\nUltimately what he's saying and what I'm saying is if you're out shopping for rights you can call me today\nYou can call another bank tomorrow ... even call you can call everybody all in the same day and potentially get the exact same rate but if you call today and then you call in the ... and you call later and you've got all this change in the market from one day to the next you're going to get all different clubs\nAnd that's just simply because the market changes and if you catch that market the right time you're good but you're also trying to find that needle mice that were you trying to find that purple unicorn and it's just not going to happen every day\nIt's funny how the how you shop for right now that it's on the Internet I remember ... used to get the paper on Sunday the largest companies would lift all their interest rate in there and you'd go look at the paper and find out who had the best raids yes so you could uh shop um around from their\nRights are what they are they are where they are much more careful when you see a low low right there just looks too good to be true every fine print you're probably paying one two three points just to get that right so it's not always as what it appears to be on the online world I guess you'd say hey we\nGot to get out of here but again if you missed any of the show check it out online at ... dot net or on Facebook and many men ... radio you guys have a great day ground rules\n[noise]\nFrom the want to get electrical broadcast that this is talk radio not boy three I'll tell you I have to be do hadn't Fifteen to end\nHis three made the world series ... Fox News [noise]\nHe's had cancer a couple of different times his dad passed away in his early sixties have cancer and he's like I don't know how much time I have left I'm retiring\nAnd so he did he was a schoolteacher so we had the pension you know and it was one of those things that he could do and he just is never going to live at a super extravagant lifestyle that's not him\nI mean but he can do what he wants to do and he still does some things for the school district so he still gets a little bit more money coming in\nBut he was able to do what he wants to enjoy whatever he's got left I I think he kind of a under sells himself and his future but but that's just me but the ideas what if you do want to retire sooner water some of the challenges John that that goes into\nYou know retirees say at fifty five there it's different retiring fifty five and six because there's a lot of rules and regulations and get that retirement money\nWell let's talk about those but the big thing I Want to stress before we get too much\nIs its retirement doesn't have to be an age it doesn't have to be you know as a uh\nIt'd be a lot of people are looking at as a destination and they want to get to that retirement [noise]\nMore often than not people will come in and sit down and we'll have conversations in and we'll look at their finances and we'll look at other assets and we start talking about what their goals and dreams are\nAnd they start projecting out when I retire when I retire and you know they might be fifty five ... that's a great time that people come in when they're in their fifties and they really start you know looking at what the future is going to hold because they want to get out of where they are\nIn after having a conversation with them you know I look and I go why are you wait until ... sixty for a while you wait until sixty two but um you can go right now so I don't want people to be constricted with just a age number just like you mentioned your buddy who was fifty five\nLet's look at what it is you want to do how much you have and can we make it happen and it may take and it's going to take a few changes probably a few you know modifications a and a few understanding of some of these things were going to talk about today so\nYeah so let's not touch on some of the rules of getting to a four O. one K. or getting to an IRA before the age of fifty nine and a half\nBecause that's that's kind of the one to hold back and then there's another big question and that would be healthcare so we'll we'll touch on that as well but let's first start with some of the rules I mean Iraq can't get to it until I'm fifty nine and a half four one K. sometimes I can before sometimes maybe\n... ... you are correct so if you're coming out of um the\nEmployer sponsored plan so the four o one K for all three B a four fifty seven some of these things\nIf you sever employment after fifty five so if you're fifty five are older and you are still employed or not employed 'cause you're suffering employment but your if your money is still in the qualified planner inside that four O. one K. for all three B\nYou can take money out of that plan without any penalty you still have to pay tax on the money but you don't have that ten percent penalty\nIf we're looking at the IRA world in some of these uh you know different I Will just the traditional i._r._a.\nIt is fifty nine and a half we have to weigh two before we pulled money out of there without getting a ten percent penalty so the four one K. that is about the biggest advantage aside from a forced savings plan is being the biggest advantage before all and K [laughter]\nBut uh the allowing of money to come out of that plan inside the four oh one K. so they can they can take money out of fifty five and above\nThat when you're no longer employed by that that are basically so you basically they're retired he got laid off there's a lot of I mean that that happens does that happen often do you have many people to get laid off and then go you know what I think I could just go ahead and retire\nThey start to look at it they come in and they sit down I'm ... and we we start to look at some of their finances and we look at or something else you mentioned health care and we're going to touch on that in a second 'cause I Want to spend some time that as well [noise] um\nBecause it used to be a real barrier before we had healthcare reform people were like well I gotta stay working because ... you know I'm you know unfortunately sometimes ... and one of the stories I think of as a couple that\nThey came in and they said you know we wanna we wanna retire but I Can't retire because my spouse has MS and I can't get health insurance well now we can so health health insurance and then again I don't want to divert too much on that 'cause they'll cover it but\nYou know let's stick with the the IRA they go oh my gosh I can retire I can get healthcare I Can't afford to do this so what we look at inside the four oh one K. is a new or never strong proponents of leaving money inside the four o one K plan\nBecause if you roll that money out after you retire there's so many other places you can put that probably so many better options are ... should say more choices you have the University of choice when you get out of the four o one K plan\nBut leave enough in there to maybe that supplies are supports your income for the next four or five years until we can get to the IRA or until we can get to some of your other assets that you know aren't going to have any penalties on the one we draw the money\nAnd that's really a by I think it it's it's a big decision but it's not something that I think just the average person could just do that can they can they just say well I'm going to pull money out of my four oh one K. are there\nI mean does it get a little complicated or not yes when I was thinking there's a little bit more than just going okay I guess are no longer work I'm just to start pulling money from my four oh one K. and you do have to remember whether it's four one K. R. I. R. E. money and has not been taxed yet so every dollar you do pull out\nAnd use you are now adding onto your income tax cut following year right\nExactly and it let me take a one story is my uh is much much sister and so my sister lives in Dallas with her husband and he they they both worked for ... and they ... forever and by the sister's husband to his name as Blake\nBlake is wanted to retire forever right so everyone out forever but let's say the last ten years he's wanted to get out of there and it's been bad and he has been fighting and claw and just to get through because he just wanted to retire so he said at fifty five I'm going to retire\nAnd then so I was always talking to him thinking that he had a pension or something that kicks in at fifty five in and he's like\nNo we don't we don't have a pension and fifty five we just have the four oh one K. and our savings well then you have my sister my sister is a very very very very very nervous person\nSo she is a deal anxious nervous or wants to support\nBlake wants to support her husband and say yes let's retire but how the heck are we going to retire if you if you quit working at fifty five where's the money going to come from well he thought he could just pull the money out of the four oh one K. and we'll just live on the four oh one\nK. money and we're going to be fine well you could\nBut there's not enough there so it was a matter of us sitting down and really looking at OK\nWhat steps are you going to take where's the income going to come from how do we contact human resources and the four one K. companies to make sure this I'll get set up properly because one false move there one bad move there\nIs a life changing decision so the stress in the anxiety that comes with that decision uh needs to be considered and looked at it and I would just stress\n... give us a call I mean the phone number is six one five six five six zero zero nine nine if you're in that fifty year old ranged fifty five year old ranger considering retiring\nUh you're starting to really look at what the future holds and where you're going to be and how much do you need and where's the income going to come from you need to give us a call at six one five six five six zero zero nine nine\nWill sit down go through have a pleasant conversation ... called it a fireside chat we won't be on our bathrobes but we'll have a nice fireside easy relaxing chat to see if it makes sense for us to to work together to help you to lay out the beginning of what we call your lifestyle maximize are so again that number six one five\nSix five six zero zero nine ...\nDo you like the idea of retiring sooner maybe you do maybe you don't well if you do think about what what would it be like to retire in my fifties\nA that is what we're talking about today kind of an exciting topic uh the question is can we realistically do it while we're talking about some of the challenges that some of the things you need to be aware of it so we've got a lot more to get to stay with us this\nIs retire fed what John maven with John Nagl and associate\n... stories are from like in a\nComfortable feeling now you can learn how to ... with the hamster will feeling you know try to keep selling point\nYou have all kind of relationship with your financial nightmare you down and having a hard time even on that front Danny I'm hungry I share some common inherently things weren't all about you and your family want you to get me now from John in the ... the only person to building tracked comparing\nFind find things I think you're right and you're on Ninety nine and\nThen come home we laughed very patient waiting\nIn how they went by the time you're on Ninety nine find here on your own mind marrying off I only knew in my view management and even if you're not having any kind of\nAnd then when I talk about retirement or think about retirement it's about choices it's about having the financial freedom to do what you choose when you choose\nIf for some people that that is a unique concept because it it hasn't been introduced to them before but if we can set your finances up and we can look at your whole plan and create a strategy and do all the steps that we're going to do to help you make new choices and to learn new stuff into go do what you want to do it's basically freedom\nSo looking at the freedom to\nOr having the freedom to make new choices to find new areas that really really excite you know and then then you're right if you're you're leaving your your social a lotta times your uh emotional your your work environment is a big thing to consider and to make sure that you have\nSomeone that can help guide you through not only the financial stuff is a little bit of the you know the emotional and looking at what you're going to do and step you're going to take\nAnd I don't you think about it because you we've seen it so many times if somebody has worked so long and so hard and they finally retire and they're just like\nBoy it's over there and there's what am I going to do now mayor Brian is always the one I think are being from the sports world them and from what the sports background\nYou know Brian what a great career you had at Texas A M at a Alabama and of course it was like he when he retired he passed away within like three weeks\nYeah you know because that was his whole identity was getting young men are strong and ready to play football and winning football and all of that and then there was nothing left that was his whole life\nAnd we're not yet I just thought of something because I think now there's a difference in some of these words and they may sound like nuances passion to me it's a little bit different than identity\nAnd I think what you're talking about bear Bryant that was his passion so I'm not suggesting you leave your passion ever you know but if you put that passion down\nNow yeah you're you're it's like you're you're going out to the farm to extend them the dog to the magical farm you know what she doesn't come back from so we want to make sure that we're we're discovering your passion and so it bear Bryant had a great quote I don't know if you ever did you know it used to carry a note around in his pocket\nAnd they're not you did not he had a note in his pocket that said see John David ... said call John ... after\nHe said call John David it was basically just I'll just summarize 'cause I Know are running short on time in the segment but it was a he read it every single day we kept it in his wallet and was basically a note that says that ah the gist of it was [noise]\nMake sure that what you're doing today is what is purposeful passionate and exciting to you because you're exchanging a day of your life for it and I think you're right that was when he quit exchanging a day of his life for his passion\nHe uh he passed away with it which was said here so we're all about helping you find your passion to find your purpose make sure you have enough money to do it called us six one five six five six zero zero nine nine\nSo we're talking about the idea of retiring sooner one of the biggest areas that are really critical when it comes to retiring soon sooner rather than later and say you're retiring before the age of sixty five healthcare you gotta have it and how are you going to do it that's our topic when we come back\nStay with us this is retired federal John even which on navy and associate\nSee [noise]\nIs retired fit I'm Mark Elliott pleased to hear what John haven of ... associates John works with is fine and build a financial plan designed help focus on living at a fulfilling\nFor retirement and we're talking about not just one thing we're not talking just about finances we're also talking about personal health physical health we're talking about everything kind of working together because if you have money and you don't have health doesn't sound like a good retirement\nYou have health but you have no money let's not probably good either and then you have money and you have health\nBut you have no personal balance in your life there's no really good thing this you know I mean it all goes together in in the idea is to try to get everything on the same page going in the same direction you know road the boat in the same direction\nSo that's kind of what we're talking about today are we are talking about the idea of retiring sooner some of the challenges that poses\nAnd if you'd like sit down with John kind of find out a little bit more about where you are on your road to retirement six one five six five six zero zero nine nine no cost normally Geisha no pressure to sit down with John six one five six five six zero zero nine nine one\nOf the biggest hurdles to that decision of I'm going to retire at fifty five for example or I'm going to retire at sixty\nIs certainly Social Security has kicked in yet so we'll talk will touch on that here and just a bit as well but health care Medicare doesn't kick in until sixty five\nCan you still keep some insurance at work even though you're retired there is a ... that's a big part of this equation of being able to retire sooner rather than later would be the health care aspect isn't it it\nIs yeah and you know we've had this health care reform going on for the last eight years and we're not sure what Trump is going to do with with a unraveling and I'd always be talked about unraveling at the gym shirts unraveled\nOr or it is on rebel just to some extent and so it's a constant question that we're always asked and I have been you know a strong proponent and I'm going politically here but my youngest daughter Julia is a diabetic and she's been diabetics as she was four\nAnd so when the the health care reform came about um [noise]\nIt really was a big positive change not only for my daughter but it was a positive change for a lot of people that we talk to you because\nYou know with with my daughter being diabetic finding health insurance we had to stay on group plans or you know we couldn't go into our own individual planned\nUm because we couldn't get coverage a lot of people that we're we're talking with that come in for retirement face that same challenge because somebody has a\nIllness or something happened where traditionally before the health care reform and they made health insurance all guaranteed issue so now health insurance is all guaranteed issue so anybody can get health insurance anywhere whether it's through the exchange which again is not our area and I'm not a hundred percent familiar with it but\nYou can go to any carrier and get health insurance is guaranteed issue that doesn't mean the price is you know favorable but that we do we can get coverage so if you have\nSomeone in your family that you're going okay I don't I you know we have the means to retire I can afford to retire\nBut it's just this health insurance we won't get health that church you can now get health insurance so that was a huge deal for my mom diabetic daughter because we couldn't get health insurance but now she is covered and she always was covered but she can get covered under an individual plan versus the group plans so I just want to stress the folks that we can do it\nWe got a budget it [noise]\nI also hear sometimes a price wise people come in and they go oh my gosh it's cost a fortune to buy health insurance you know it's going to cost me two thousand dollars a month ago I was talking to my neighbor and my neighbor said\nNo it ... it's not always that expensive and then we've got resources and people that we can help get your health insurance so a critical component for sure we do need the coverage because Medicare doesn't kick in sixty five\nBut in that it's one of the challenges because sometimes you can leave and and your employment will still allow you that what's that yelled when they\nAre we can cobra ... for Eighteen months if the employers big enough I think you need more than fifty employees are I Know they can get very expensive though yes Colbert and get expensive but you can also\nYou don't have to stay on that plan because now they have the portability law where you can move from your group sponsored plan and doing it is individual plan and there is no longer preexisting conditions\nSo they have to take you\nAnd it just depends on the planes are coming from\nYou know what your costs will be your what your your benefits will be in that way but this is\nProbably one of the biggest expenses that you will have isn't it\nYes yes it will so to get to be expensive for sure especially if you get to age\nSix so really what you're saying is just let the ... you're saying if you find somebody that you know so you can have the coverage I'm saying just roll\nDice come on there's nothing you can add up to five [laughter]\nMark is not the one that you want to call if you have if you're going to retire because if you roll the dice do not listen to that if you roll the dice now what are you jeopardizing you're jeopardizing\nA basically everything on one because you I mean one bad health they could wipe out your adult you know and it's really\nIt really is amazing because I Do think that the health care and I think it's one of the challenges and I know that's one of the areas that you'll talk about in the lifestyle maximize or\nYou know when when people come and you're going to talk about income planted here to talk about investment plan is going to talk about tax plan of going to talk about health and long term care legacy an estate planning because all of that is part of the lifestyle maximize er\nAnd it's a well rounded you know the the physical the financial the personal all of that working together\nBut at the end of the day when you think about something happening most of us don't think last never going to happen to me you know you drive by a car wreck on the while that's crazy I Can't believe that just happened right over there was never going to happen to me well I've got a friend that is fifty six years of age\nBen diabetic like kind of like your daughter Julia for a long long time so he's had the ... different things and he's my golfing partners and what he is well we played in a tournament I'm In the Ozarks in\nMay and torrential rains\nAnd he ends up like a month later gets pneumonia he can't get over it and so when they took him off the directs the flu it all came back they go you got congestive heart failure they go in and try to put some stance and can't do it they go but we think we can fix it so on a friday he goes in as seven our heart surgery at the age of fifty six", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Battleground State Report", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
