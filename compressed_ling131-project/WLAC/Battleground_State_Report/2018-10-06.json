deserve what's up [noise]\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college money from my one year old mhm I'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy\nThousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so\nFive is address kids' college and it's different being there in you know number ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your two ... and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nOr any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably only about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find in my budget almost keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand in that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it currently with the U.S department of treasury\nHum it as a result of having been additional service academy or three years ago and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue paying off the smallest at first or should I\nI'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know the fact that will eventually end up any collections account\nIf I'm not able to pay the amount of all I'm\nYeah I'm In what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile so you learn you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on line three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got wonderful income you'll be different\nTwo years it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to untie thirty thousand bucks this thing or if it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either after the surge through in the service or you're assigned to\nThe recruitment and death and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good

two to five Jill is with us in Phoenix Hi Jill how are you [noise]\nThere thanks for taking my call and I've been here for a while\nI I have a problem that I'm hoping you can help me with my daughter who is bipolar just had a baby two weeks ago and [noise] she was living with a man who had family his wife had died and have three small boys to make it short she\nSigned away a lot of things that you shouldn't have one is taken out a couple of title alone in her car a rubber check credit card games can make a long story short she's got\nA few collection agencies after her\nShe can't be here with me right now and how much she really knows I don't know I Believe\nIt's over four thousand and eight I'm not I'm not sure she kept a lot of last year she almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question she says she has no money I Do not want to pay our debt [noise]\nUm what does she have a nice collection agencies literally she has nothing\nIs ... is she still living with this guy now he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nIf kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight the fear in Arizona I gave myself and my husband uh there's constantly taking care of the baby now and go wherever Sean ... baby stays with me\nOkay so ... now moved in with you yeah she's with me the ... the baby on the mother correct okay good\nGood that's good news okay good so here here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing and that she's dealing with bipolar and you know you date she is what we in the business called judgment proof\nOh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants\n[laughter] that's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking you know he wasn't you know her boyfriend had said to me well I didn't make Lee and find anything that she wasn't aware of but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that in the second book let's assume that debt is valid for us it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her to work her way through it when she gets back on her feet\nShe might even got a job right now I Know yeah\nI Know what I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid ... in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we worked with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes\nAlong with offer him in the past year and I realized she probably had her biological clock ticking going well\nMom and dad have always told me he shouldn't get pregnant on him he's mad because she's on to ferment every day so she's been from the\nBottom line is random line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but\nNot under medication um that that she can live a very normal life I make good decisions about everything child rearing financially and everything in a bi\nEver had you know but it can happen it can I have no choice on what\nHappens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January cook myself off\nOf her checking because", "show_name": "Battleground State Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "06"}
