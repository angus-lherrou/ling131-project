at whether or not we shape I buy a house and that way with Tom ...\nLike actually and we we want to hear you\nWell I mean it's a personal decision I made a personal decision I don't go into debt and once I got out I don't think I could go back\nRight and that kind of the you know what we're thinking about having you know we definitely that if you know actually fan on and and\nNow I mean you could benefit with Bob uh [laughter] but you bend it\nTo do it I mean you know it's it's from want his ... definitely not a need you have a house so ah two hundred thousand dollars how much do you make now what's your household income\nAnd I am twenty okay okay and you don't have any debt but your home or you don't have that at all\nYeah we don't have any guy because\nNo payments in the world you're making two hundred grand how fast can you save two hundred grand\nAt that point you know it's ... years fifty grand a year or two hundred and you want to buy a better house if you get the house unless you did this I bet I bet you could do it in a little over two\nHow about you want the house [laughter] well I guess now that in that yeah you know you go but bad enough to go in that\nSo this is where this is you know I I'm picking on your just to make you think okay I'm a I'm not I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing what happened was sharing a nine Jody when we went broke was we should never again\n\nNever again they'll take phone call if somebody calls us collecting money it's a wrong number\nRight okay and and life is God\nAnd there's nothing I Want bad enough to go back into the noose again\nWhere the borrower slave to the lander that's our decision that's how we decided to live that's what we teach people the goal is it's kind of like the holy grail that Iran's you show racket everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and now you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms\nI couldn't do it\nIt makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it but if you do it\nYou know you're just living in a different things so you called me to ask me my opinion what would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and that sort of never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really work hard to save up the money for it\nAnd I have to sacrifice all the stuff to get it and then it makes me go I like my lifestyle but I don't know like those two more bedroom so I'm probably not going to cut my lifestyle down to nothing to get this which is kind of what you just said and I show um which is okay that's okay choice you just made the choice though but what that does is it allows us to buy something we can't afford\nShow I mean you can do whatever you want to do what you and I'll be friends I'm not really mad at you but you called the Dave Ramsey showing us to borrow money\nAnd it just new you're not ever going to get a yes on that one um show and just makes me sad that you would go back in so I I Would 'cause I I think he doesn't stop and measure the freedom that you have the sense of peace that you have the economy turned down to the gym your house paid for back then if you did that feel\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere because I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them home with a mortgage\nSo we just we quit\nBorrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms in downtime ...\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of
