answers or are you only shouting things\nDown or you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights mean where do your rights even come from\nToday I saw I think progress write a whole article about how the constitution has failed that was a headline the constitution has failed\nAnd then it goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document and the three fifths in the constitution all lies all lies\nNow you can argue that or we can begin to teach our children you can argue that\nAnd you can throw it back in their face with some sort of habitat or\n\nName calling of some sort\n\n[noise] here's the question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad that requires real thought and discussion because\nIt is neither in my opinion it is both it has been a force for bad and I warn you if we leave the bill of rights we will become the darkest force ever on earth\nWith our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people\nWe free the blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe've

forget about the past let's talk about\nThe future we have never ever reached\nThe heights demanded by our mission statement\n\nBut have we gotten better is it still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self evident\nThat all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nWho you have do you have everything the baby\nLaying next to you has when you were born as far as human rights and dignity\n\nDo you still believe that\nThat I'm not talking about well it's not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's thrives and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw got into it too I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than manned\nReason why the creator is important is if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away rights so if you want to see\nHe's turning these the grave cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doubts each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more\nAnd that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this\nAs an aspirational statement we're only talking about the past we're talking about the mistakes of the past you cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying where we're going\nSo where are we going to fall you want to terrorists down there now I read your website I read your mission statement I strongly disagree capitalism is not the problem\nCapitalism that is that has no moral sentiment is\nBut you don't fix that by a state run economy by co ops it's always fails no you\nAnd your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\nDo we need to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future\nBecause that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can doing the hard things not the easy

let me go to Anthony in Massachusetts aloe Anthony you're on the Glenn Beck\nProgram I Glenn how are you good how are you\nDoing well so you know I'm looking at you you you mentioned earlier that are really that the opposition are the people leading this leadership that the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inner partying out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there I Would have party members they\nWork every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media\nAnd they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a poll or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts are that\nAh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference in unusual and peculiar people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seen their side being unreasonable violence if you see anti FAA the way to answer and so far is not\nWith uh the militant people that will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group you have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility your kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd\nBut you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book or let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck\nProgram Hi Glenn how are you I'm very good um I\nOverall I agree with every book I think it's awesome\nAnd I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um you're\nTalking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all of a job than and I know you don't necessarily agree with the I bet you've said that we need to at least have a conversation about\n... because of it yeah and I you know I think we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering heavy I I think that they're really using fear over a I to try to come in and Institute that's that's it\nYeah it's I think that they want ... socialism I think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right on ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their thoughts that right there probably correct and\nUm I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the time\nYou know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a machine thing they are running you know there are certain things I just can't like I'm being a ... a leak in or climbing in her house probably not going to do that um\nAs far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think people are going to be upset if they go into the tunnels and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet is known for their service and I ... that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you that first of all just a ... there's a don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ah what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than tape work unless I'm sound coming just ... you know different perspectives are having to sit there for a search that I Know that you have sure on that\nBut you know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer a quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so Heather are there is a very and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it uh there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see\nOur emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago [noise]\nThe uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started your comment about the section of the book where I or there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nThe culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hits high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent\nIf there is a democratic victory in the house and God Forbid the Senate we are looking at a different world and it the next two years are going to be very very different\nUh I've read the report and I am

the same thing [noise]\nKeeping our children the fit school so what's your weeks ago I asked seven very different American to sit down with me and help me find an answer\nWe found an answer but it wasn't at all what I thought it would be the answer as it turns out to my complete surprise is a single digit number [noise]\nA number that would have to leave written on a ... posted dumped and passed over to me with a handful of others as part of a kind of warm up exercises the seven were just sitting down to begin our conversation [noise] as you hear me read all the numbers down to the group several weeks\nAgo three ten ten or ... why\nKeep in mind one of them is our answer forward\nLet me start by telling you about that than\nI Am and high school teacher and a mother of three boys three one boy I Am a fire little stricter\nI was a police officer in Arlington policeman Virginia for thirty seven years\nI've wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find the older that I get the more progressive and liberal but I become I Am very much on on that high I oh is that for the person that scares ...\nEven wanted their experiences and feelings about guns to be different\nThough yeah shot down in the closet or not he had shot that I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our homes are locked out I've never seen them I don't want to say that ... started shooting I just asked my dad and his redneck buddies out in the country\nThese seven words thoughtful well informed\nOr to people who all agreed to spend an entire evening talking to people they didn't even know why to come up with a list and I wanted to find a list and even if it was a very short one specific\nPractical things that we could all agree upon to help combat this intangible threat to our kids that we all think about from time to time an intangible threat that a ... a teacher in the room explain from the perspective of being inside the schools each and every day\nAnd any time there is any sort of anything out of the norm at school and the kids get weird they get fat and just feeling among the entire school than something tried fully wrong and\nI think it all over the country I think that you hear and noise in the hallway when you're ISIS quiet and everyone had turn [noise]\nWith that awareness we begin talking\nThe story of that conversation has two parts the content that dumped up with that and then the impact what happened because of what was said so content [noise]\nWe searched for the list for almost four hours I'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there were considering remember same children same goal\n\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize that in this age of unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation\nListened to the following exchange between two mothers Anna a progressive\nAnd Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people opinions and perspectives are brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear and\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself and it's kind of and I'm not going to let you are but I think it's kind of a bank at Penn and play\nAre ... rubble ideas we can come up with that well I'm going to ...\nBy and you're right there are probably ... over there and your reasonable but that leaders movements are not reasonable I that's why is that when there's a school shooting last shooting someplace stuff first things we hear\nWhen Ethan control and they enter a it's a bad\n[noise]\nSo many other opinions and voiced his most of them extreme jumped right into our conversation on minute thirty nine and reaching much heightened from the get go\nBeneath our firearms instructor who almost missed a round table because she had food poisoning speaks about the problem was letting other people speak for on\nThey inflammatory temper\nYou know agitator that are being the talking heads on the media is thinking France thing for me that are up for that kind of that kind of craziness does not represent me and I would like to think that you know when I see the ultra liberal you know screaming about all that stuff and calling\nPeople like me and gotten nuts and all that I Would like to think that that's not representative and yeah so how do we solve that problem with\nGetting the people from stopping the ones that are out there trying to send a message because for me I think it's the wrong one and it's not productive\nI became aware very quickly that it's almost impossible to have a productive conversation with so many other voices\nReference to repeat it how can I get each person just to speak for themselves [noise]\nBut it would take a while\n\nSo let me tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's American financing do is use of American financing\nAnd um because voter lying and saying uh\nShe uh when who did you get it for ... you get your loan finally from Vito\nIs that we got it from a vetoes cousin vetoes ... not to be named yeah because those who got a little\nLike okay they are what are you give me nothing down\nA but if you don't pay I take your children there's some children and I do lose my knee caps right but ... ...
