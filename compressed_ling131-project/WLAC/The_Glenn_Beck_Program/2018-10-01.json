Mitchell did a report for the Republicans in the Senate and shared her\nHer recommendations as a prosecutor and and said look at this case wouldn't be brought by any prosecutor district case couldn't be brought by the prosecutor 'cause it is non winnable as you pointed out this is one of the things that didn't her letter to the Republicans it's now been leaked to the Washington Post quote a she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the vet and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and I would point out that they either refuted or fail to corroborate the allegations under penalty of perjury under penalty of felony conviction and her best friend who she says well backer up\nIs not backing up and then she attacked her bicycle she's got health problems help right well let's delve into Dr lazy Ford's background and see what sort of health or other issues she has among other things again we've seen repeatedly the mini way she's lied she's she's painted herself\nA and portrayed herself as a psychiatrist\nA psychiatrist is a medical professional a medical professional she is not a psychiatrist she is a psychologist and at that she's more of an academic\nPsychologist and would love to see some of the academic work she's actually produced you know she's not like arches it'd be like it'd be like somebody who's a paralegal falsely proclaiming themselves to be a lawyer you get prosecuted for that\nI suppose we could the FBI could ask her brothers two brothers who were living in the same house she was in the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nOr two ... two parents who are living in that same house who presumably\nA would have talked to her that evening of the alleged event and you know she never said a word to them that evening or the next evening or the evening after that she actually never said anything to them\nFor thirty six years even while she was talking to the Washington Post even while she was talking to Senator Feinstein staff she was concealing all this\nEven when she was talking to a beach friends in California they weren't on her on\nYeah she wasn't talking to her parents about it or who lives in the same house in Nineteen eighty two or who two brothers who by the way are both attorneys in Washington DC\nAnd even though her husband's family has written a letter of support you know vouch for her\nHer parents having signed the letter her siblings haven't signed the letter what did they know\nAnd when did they know it to paraphrase the old Watergate questioning Howard Baker and Fred Thompson what did her family no and when did they know what apparently they didn't know anything and and when you've got this\nThis consistent pattern of\nPer verification to be kind to Dr Blasey Ford that is coming forward are fringe him half the gateway pundit delved into her story that then all of this came back to her mind and she for the first time identified that this it actually happened still didn't uh didn't apply\nBrett Kavanaugh by name but in two thousand twelve she she had this therapist that she and her husband went to because they were having some marital difficulties over her desire to have two front doors in their home that they were remodeling\nNow the therapist notes are being withheld we're not getting the therapist note what does the therapists know to actually say because we're just getting these sort of\nRedacted snippets of what she wants to know was said about this in those therapists notes that it's being hidden why she hiding stuff if she's so transparent but one of the things the gym hopped in gateway pundit found out was it while her story is that this therapist session\nThat came about because she and her husband were having some difficulties over her desire for two front doors in the remodeling that they were doing well he went back and pulled I Love this\nPulled the a request that you have to file with the city if you're doing building a building permit and the building permit on this home\nWas issued in two thousand eight four years before she claims it necessitates this therapy session in two thousand twelve\nHer her story doesn't stand up even if you don't look outside her story her story doesn't stand up internally with what she says and what his verify oblique fault like her claim oh I Can't fly on the freight to fly and yet we find that she flies all over the country all the time\nSo so we do know do things with absolute certainty after the hearing even before we get the FBI investigation Brett Kavanaugh like beer\nAnd Christine Blasey Ford is a lawyer we know that with certainty because she lied about the flying thing she lied about when they were doing their home construction she's lied about when she uh who's paying for her stuff and when she met with various people we also now know from the Feinstein timeline she met with Feinstein's staff\nBut for she produced this letter Feinstein staff helped articulate her claims in that letter that is still falling apart as more and more issues come forward it was two boys it was four boys were five people in the house she can't even get the story straight\nEven though she rubber she had one beer she can't remember where she was when she was there what year it was her story doesn't stand up under her own ... disinformation misinformation and and inconsistent\nSounds like a set up to me I have two questions just we close out number one will the Senate vote on the

that's going to do it enough I think they're going to come up with some other bogus kind of like that had sweating it kind of had this ... girl kinda like they had the guy that recanted they claimed that he was running a rape session on boats up in New England somewhere\nI I think you're going to get another bogus claim late probably Thursday night Thursday's just to just to say oh we need another week are we going to investigate this thing on the whatever they're going to lay on and then I got to lay on him until\nWednesday night maybe Thursday mid day and then try to create a

hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel Mitchell's memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was a woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Iraq Obama's head of homeland security\nAs the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack and also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is on old crimes\nTo be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any it's CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating\nTo you I Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event\nAnd those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this\nThis poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah I ... ah the homeland security prosecutor addicts crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amount of credibility in with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's\nIt ... won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible a but\nBased on what she said not how she looked\n\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lift the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty\nSix but then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attack changed to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYear in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens why did\nThe change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years\nIt it gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged attack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties\nPerhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false\n\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post\nFor narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks for what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important Nick ... events of her

Democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that rate you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head\nAnd promote these outrageous accusations against him a specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick who just don't even ask the snow is I mean we're\nThere they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I could kind of speak to the culture and how how those communities operate I mean the thought that a group a Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape carts hell all throughout high school and nobody would know anything about it\nUp until now is just it's ludicrous and then that they edit goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened the cheaper is frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man\nOh all me and my buddies we were the college chicks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who let's be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete torque when he was ... when he was in high school this is somebody who kept ... you can see on this calendar he literally has notes of what his parents would ground him\nI mean this guy was a complete ... in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this is\nGreat I'm really happy so the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we've abandoned a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right\nWhere we just believe things based on a matter of faith based on historical pattern of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late that they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things or because you know\nWomen have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism in there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right\nIt's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life and they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system you go back and you look at the polls then\nTo the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and let me tell you I think uh [noise]\nDoctors poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony or think of as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies\nThat would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least its severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated\nAnd how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what you're doing now is that they're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank while he was in college or whatever I mean who cares\nBut it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like pleading Adam hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow\nHe is a Democrat or who are has not lost his footing ah with with reason [noise] um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\n\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper right there you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular\nSituation other people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder so the question now is the economist is right and\nThere's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented his exculpatory right that the guys calendar clear is that right the testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast at a side and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happens four times so I think people need to cash this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell\nGoing to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge I I've never\nMet demand nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of your state right now and based off its own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not Brett Cabot but we're not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with his judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family was like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations\nJust because we disagree with them with a clear ideologically that each state and that's what they do and and and banana republic that in third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you

to gather\nOne of tons of work did has words\nThat's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so leery tell me your day one you're governor of New York where do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing was about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority says we don't go ... percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen ... percent but it was something to vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nAnd it does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is is that the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even come in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats and Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat they don't have to worry about small business\nThey don't have to about smaller government they will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left\nAnd all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that will libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive a massive\nCulture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nDon't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire four years this is my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency is a problem with low governments now is they're enforcing the kings well so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the government to be\nI'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSo do you read the constitution or what does that I don't know I\nKnow I Know it's I'm not sure where he's an old during the day to die\nAnd they sort of the way a while ago yeah [noise] but yes that's\nMy point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met or individual businesses that individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community\nWe don't do that well in New York said it all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent and\nOpened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county how 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and sort of lowering spending\nHere's one idea that does both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that British named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up I'm\nGoing to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year a marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that's using the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nHundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nKind of law at Texas hang on just like a Texas New York's popular says Texas you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but here's the best part now we have them do maintenance\nAgain we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility\nTheir job is just to repair it right they begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now in New York state collapse we don't have enough money\nThese guys do will have to have safer bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars\nAn hour if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge\nLess money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's
