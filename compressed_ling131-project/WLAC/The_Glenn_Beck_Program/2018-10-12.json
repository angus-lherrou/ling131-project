gets it wrong you know I don't know what I'm for five years\nWhat's my name what what's the name I don't know [laughter]\n[laughter] that's all right Jason is a Jason's our guy who uh you know uh\nIt's kind of a wannabe spook and this guy is can I say that any more oh my gosh my apologies to actual Halloween spook ... and to the CIA I Apologize I so\nI'm Jason is a guy who watches a international affairs for us and I am fascinated by this story of ... a from a from Saudi Arabia\nOr and I want you to bring me I Want you to bring me the news that no one in the news is reporting on this but let me bring everybody up to speed if you haven't been following this guy in a nutshell he worked for the Washington Post he's a revered ribs veered reporter which makes me ... suspicious immediately\nBut he's a revered ... a a reporter Washington Post he is a Saudi citizen\nHe was over in Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy\nAnd so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy hours and hours and hours going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out she calls the embassy and they say oh\nNo he left he left just the oh he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside I'm not sure if he went out bill did he go out the front door yes so Phil and the other guy\n... says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door [noise]\nSo [noise] the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis the Saudi prince\nLands of gulfstream his gulfstream ... at the airport there I'm In turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they pile up in the back of the vans their drive into the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases they buy some more empty suitcases they also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bones\nSaw [laughter] they buy a boat saw Oh thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the ball and saw\nGod only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seen leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back of the van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off\nMeantime United States says we do have a we do have a an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping more tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nA and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or showed in the United states this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered we don't know if that is true but that's the latest today so ... we're going to find out who this guy is and was possibly ah when we come back because this is the part of this story that no one\nSurely CNN and Christiana autumn poor would want you to have this information will give that to your next [noise]\nWith them um and it was friends with the crown prince though was he not um I don't know how they're framing it he was friends\nHe was he was ... he loved the crown brands they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies\nAnd that's where they've ... wants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that's the best way to put it for this guy but he's a\nHe's not a good guy he wants to political Islam he wants political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work at Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy then on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling he they\nDug plain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of the life he is a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they had a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest of the doubt that hit the street have you want to see the place where the next ah Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia the the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised rattle\nSo how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug\nYou can't I mean it's like Russia really either bright groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for a\nWhile maybe doubtful here's the problem we are we are pushing through a major arms deal with\nSaudi Arabia we should not be doing that nope we should not be doing that that should be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and they're probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia going look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate\nHave at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's business is a man stay out of their business chemical production\nYeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame a very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no shelter salmon get him out of him [noise]\nNo radio at the office no problem you can stream I show

U. T. H.\nAnd she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ss gorge did and she terrorized women are and participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress and went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay and then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform I'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off\nAfter the war ends of free

later they get to\nThe state department finally tracked her down sends her back to Germany where she's still alive Beck and every month gets to the United states Social Security check\nUh September eighth it's twenty Seventeen was the last night I went to church um\nEarly in the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we're going to separate oh separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating [noise]\nUm and I looked at it on that day\nAs a as a new beginning go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you were going to sue\nI didn't know what I was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false huh it was a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever\nCome forward it was all anonymous sourcing [noise]\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on and go find another job this could just go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mine for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we're celebrating the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start and then I drink on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang I was a young man on the other side of the fallen sang miserable and call your son call Eric right away so what's wrong is just cleric right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying and for some reason I just went right to um is he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] she said no [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was a rough day the next state went to Colorado\n[noise] and uh the president called me as anything we can do for you [noise] I said no\nThank you [noise] but at that day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to to create awareness around a opioids\nAmerica what his antics on campus [noise] [noise]\n[noise] you know ... ... ... so yeah so that was that day [noise]\nUh and so now we are a year in two days after\nThat and it's been rushed calm you we can stop at any time if you don't want to talk about anything so um [noise]\nI think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive\nWhy we're there indications or I was just a bad feelings that feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and it's told the call your son right away without explaining why they had the ... enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat and all it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed and was an accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment I had no fighting needs to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close we spent the better part of the next year just talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic\nExcuse me and a and\nA ... parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and not sure what you're taking the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlantic City exposed to potentially dying from an overdose\n\nIt's a very emotional and I think important um interview\nThere\nThere are places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think tense\nUm and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on on the opioid thing I mean I I um I got an emotional all yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you for speaking up for opioids because there are those of us who\nWe cannot live without them we can't say this woman said because of her disease she can't even sit up in bed and she's bed ridden without the opioid there are you know\nAll of these things they're double edged swords they're they're good when they're used properly and they are\nDeadly when they are abused and uh it's up to each of us uh to to know what we're dealing with and they are deadly um that podcast also goes into his relationship with the president in what he is seen as\nThe president and uh it's a very fascinating interview\nWith Eric bowling you can find that podcast wherever you download your podcast I tunes now and modify but everywhere or the Glenn Beck podcast they come out every Saturday and different interview with somebody who is truly fascinating\nDoctor radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ... the ah\nIf

principles so we wanted somebody with some a real uh meat on the bones\nAnd a guy who I have really grown to love but he already had another job or is Steve days\nSteve works for see our TV\nUh but we have convinced the our TV too also kind of it's kind of like a Warner Brothers and ah you know the old the paramount studios deal where we're like okay well you can use our star for this movie and we've convince them to ah let us use Steve\nTo uh do a program immediately after this and welcome to the program\nNow Steve Day so are you I'm doing well get to see guys that were really really excited about this starts on Monday\nYeah starts on Monday he's still going to be on the our TV's still gonna be doing to see our TV thing but he's doing a two hours of for us everyday tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] like that are just living in ... when he said the second best why here's we did have had it he's number one and then space by our space butter space by your number\nTo help move in that I understand why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do you\nKnow we actually talking about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them [noise] ah because we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time 'cause we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names are returning to the uh uh the ... factory of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over\nLogging verbal bombs at our neighbor over there and we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay I I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend ... and I'm perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I'm a doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything [laughter] but I'm looking for the people who you can't have\nA conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress there is\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees either maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas and enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy of somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants a government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside\nOutside of the Haiti arena I agree that there are you know\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't\nTalk ... she has no interest in his ... he wants to end you want to share a country with a ...\nIt's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen\nShare pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd wrote the way it happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has it gotten away with everything funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAs she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or any later I Can't I Can't and ... do you watch them never except for when I'm On the year ... India and unless it's\n... hang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this job great without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... long form it's just toxic ingestion and the vast yeah my mom watches a lot more of that she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is find why so by Medicare\nThinks that Medicare for all is okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail because she's not fight we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with that ...\nSo I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems um of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like were communists right and so we have\nWe have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that\nCover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and of capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I've worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement rather than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers the GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down into the talking points we in conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants on wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time\nIt actually totally and reverse the majority of ... and you know it's fascinating is if you did a huge study on this breaking it down into twenty sixteen electorate at the the libertarian the myth of the libertarian voter minutes how they define them that voter largely does not exist as a unicorn okay the ...\nOr it has gotten a the top pick for home security from seeing that and all of the ah technology you know I'm a experts\nIt's simply say order it right out simply say fact dot com that's simply safe back dot com if you use the ... back you're going to save ten percent off your home security system it is simply safe back dot com [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W ...

I. lazy\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with us Steve days pat gray a stew steeper gear or executive\nProducer and of course my charming self uh we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have Eric Holder saying a chicken when they're down\nIs this is this the or is this the\nBeginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\nUm I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with Benny sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four ago but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with this stability thing\nThat they're completely ah issuing I think\nI think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change a say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist no movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the rights that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we are we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore I think we're ... to get the referenced\nI'm making here so okay let's let's pick it up there how do we um how do we come come back and ah how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have\nMuch more in common with us\nBecause they do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may now I'm back in a minute\nNo radio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W. L. A. C. dot com\nRadio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W. L. A. the\nAnd so we talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group it was a\nTurning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they didn't hide God three times in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in the near seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that\nHad decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is a this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth Olson Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and became seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan and say this okay say\nI'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes shareware in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor you're you're attacking their idol this was not mere political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement this religious fervor you're dealing with the lucid sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they come to short\nRace thing translate that into human language\n[laughter] uh I I I think we see that with\nGlobal warming with a with their reaction to abortion with is roe v Wade thing that means absolutely
