{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Moving together the picture nominee Kim seems really even bother looking down on when they\nGet home quicker we can help ... another traffic update in less than ten minutes on TALK radio Ninety eight going green beans and tell me you will lazy [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd work of making this is as soon as he started to force the Michael Patrick Leahy and on Fridays joined by Dr cake\nAny interest with his prognostications with the friday football forecast already in uh Alabama UT Alabama twenty eight point favorite and uh he's picking UT Penn State a fourteen four point favorite over Indiana picking the points with Penn State Vanderbilt Kentucky\nKentucky and eleven and a half point a favorite and he's going with Kentucky and Mississippi State\nUnless you unless you still reeling out after a big win\nBut uh um\nThese go with Mississippi State and the titans head to London england for their uh for their overseas trip meant that the I recently had to make a quick trip to London and back\nAnd I got to tell you the first twenty four forty eight hours man I I was I not only was there for like three days but the first twenty four hours and specially man I was jet lag like crazy I Can't imagine playing a football game\nWell it's certainly going to be challenging I've never been blessed to be able to go to um Europe but uh hopefully you know in my life I'll have that opportunity\nTo Paris, Tennessee though now I have been to Paris assured that back in eighty four [laughter] anyway um\nSo this is a football game that just I mean this football team\nIs whoa frustrating for me I'm a there's been so much said this week on\nThat we lost a doctor case bone he'll call us back in a moment again this this jet lag back now the titans decided to go late I think the the ravens were going earlier\nThis week they wanted to get kind of act\nLittle ravens they're not putting the ravens is who we got to who they play they they they just got stumped by the ravens\n... who they who they plan even we might as well Dr King will call and tell us I think it's I think it might be the Vikings I don't I'm not sure if it is the only doctor came will call us and we'll tell us a we'll find out who who they're playing but at this London thing to me how's that working out for the NFL I don't think so great\nYeah you know again the the the the crowds that you see in in years past or not\nAre not big crowd I mean they're getting maybe it's for the TV maybe it's for the for the selling merchandise and those sorts of things but they are not\nUm being embraced again as part of the we're going to globalize the NBA's trying to do the same thing the NHL has a better shot to do this because\nThe NHL has a lot of foreign players the NBA has a lot of players coming in from Russia coming in from from China and other places so so they they can make the the international play you don't have a lot of feeder college football\nIn in in London in England that that would feed into an NFL team in in England\nTheir planes is the Los Angeles chargers now talking about travel think about this the Tennesseans though that the [laughter] the Tennessee Titans\nAre are going from Nashville apparently there's a direct flight now British Airways apparently uh\nThey're they're leaving like this evening and they wake up at six thirty in the morning friday morning in London\nBut the the Los Angeles times are leaving from Los Angeles they're going across the United states and then they're going to ... that's a long trip\nYou add another three hour of of body clock being off a off tab and and not sure how that ah how that's\nGoing to charges of got to be a favorite in this you know look I I'll tell you what uh I Try not to watch the uh the NFL these days uh but occasionally 'cause I'm a sports guy I'll I'll watch it I think this might be Phil Rivers year the foreign to\nA and that is there's just there's not a lot of sympathy I think from even Americans who are open\nTo to a border reforming immigration reform yeah it's just that we were attacked the ends and do it three weeks before an election it's almost like Donald Trump was like hey guys would you want to creating a caravan and sending it this way and I what I Will do that we'll talk about it and it will help us win this election and then afterwards you guys can go back home will\nPay for your boss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states\nAnd I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy in paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and he gets you across the border is that what you're doing or you just\nYou're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf would be a these things are so\nBad so bad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot or she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like\nTo say that we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole three part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant bond there in a green area is a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like\nAlone [laughter] without your brother [laughter]\nI [laughter] would you stop\nAnd think about how you know pretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] look\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you'd probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there in certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations where like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to at the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone has a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a ... it's a different story\nAnd you just want her first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about\nA hardening the borders this is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa it you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish matter right\nAnd you know like four thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight it feels like waiting does they're just ... like the top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right look over running the security\nThere there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet ah the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful a war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they're going to work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back to them they send back to them if they do it without permissions they sent back to them but we can't uh\nIs Beto ... over or yeah or some better know ... ... of our so anyway the that a race continues to be pretty interesting right now it looks like\nCruz has is pretty well in hand him right now it's up by seven I think on the average\nYeah he is up about by seven um he of course is a a deep Hispanic roots as why if you don't know what better way to do is they deem a Hispanic nickname for this deeply Hispanic man\nWhose name Robert Francis O'Rourke\nI'd might not signify to you that how Hispanic he is which is why he's called Beto right that that's right um but yeah he was hit me I I I assume he probably was a dreamer right\nHe probably came here you know you would soon that he was in Iowa or Lyndon dreamed up coming to the United states and then came here and became a Spanish and I think he believed he was until the Hispanic caucus said a no new who ... even the nickname didn't get him in it oh\nThat's weird Ryan racism exact here is a Beto addressing his nickname when\nCongressman throughout the campaign you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic\nSo what does the Hispanic community mean to you and what relationships do you have with that community\nSo to to her part of the question about my name was born Robert Francis or work on a path friends has to work with the son of John Francis or fathers saying that you're listening Francis work or who will go as UFO\nUm for much of his life um\nAnd and from day one in El Paso and and you know this and that gallon if you were born Robert or Albert for Gilbert formed back into your folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that I've gone a bar for my entire life\nI'm born and raised in fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than ... percent Mexican American\nUh first of all I'm just you know I'm not Hispanic I no one calls me or any name other than stew of at this point which isn't even my named either or you can criticize me the same way you can talk about better because that's actually not my name my name's to have\nA ... I'm called Stu thanks a lot for to Glenn Beck for that one but I but I Would say there is first of all it's just an inefficient process I I don't mean to criticize a the culture\nThe of the Hispanic people but if you have if if if it's true what ... saying which is anyone who's named any foreign names\nAre all called ... is that true everyone who know everyone is called Albert it's called that's how everyone everybody\nBorn in El Paso that of Irish\nAmerican descent that same Albert Robert framed home ... better than you know we can go and fight an actual Robert in\nEl Paso do any exist\nMaybe somebody in El Paso if you were in El Paso or anywhere around there and your name is Robert I'd love to know if you exist because what we were just told him as everyone knows if you're happy to grow up and do your name is Robert bills Ted Stanley Orlando or Reginald you're referred to as best hope [laughter] I I Can't\nBe true American ... and\nAnd I don't think it is I\nI think it's not a common nickname in some communities it probably is but it wasn't his can\nBe is it not cultural appropriation did he not appropriate Hispanic culture\nIs that not a problem\nIf that is a thing\nThis is an example of it yes\nNow [laughter] I'm not going to sit here and tell you what the thing is I think it's a ridiculous thing but I'm sure that's how it will tell\nUs it's a thing yes [noise] yes he would [noise]\nAll right and in the meantime we'd love to hear from Roberts in El Paso or near el ...\nDean ... though are you back into ...\nYou leave deal and the tendencies Starr Report back Monday morning at five on TALK radio Ninety eight point dream and Fifteen ten W well ac\nWith only a kite a husky and west hamstring\nBenjamin Franklin captured lightning and about [noise] over two hundred and sixty years later with a little resourcefulness\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy from the sun\nEnsuring Americans have the energy they need [noise] whenever\nWendy what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after his head as Sean who's blink camera alerted him a burglars trying to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent a police to help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double a backup\nDave Ramsey weekday afternoon from five to light on talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W while I use the\n\nLanguage program congressman throughout the campaign you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic\nSo what does the Hispanic community mean to you in what relationships do you have with that community\nSo to to clarify the question about my name was born Robert Francis or work on a path for instance to work with the son of John Francis or father to Ulysses Francis or work or who will go as UFO\nUm for my wife [noise] um and\nAnd from day one in El Paso and and you know this and that gal and if you are more and Robert or Albert for Gilbert ...\nYour folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that I've gone a bar for my entire life I'm born and raised in fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than ... percent Mexican American\nOkay so if you're born Robert al ... Albert Albert Gilbert Umberto Paul Frank\nMhm Blaine be if you have Don ...\nJak yup or a Frank ... ear called Beto\nAnd Frank twice ... some guy because that is true I agree just learned that amazing actors now remember I didn't realize too he said it's not just El Paso and all of a sudden the calendar Kelly is all over Texas is apparently what's true here yeah um and and one of the things I Would love to do today\nTo see to test this it\nIs it true that there is no example of someone named\nRobert Albert Gilbert or a baritone who was not named uh what they eat it looks so if you were Gilbert and people call you Gilbert apparently ...\nDo you do not exist you are not a person you're not a it's like we just we have no evidence that you exist so if you happen to\nBe a Robert an Albert Gilbert or an embarrassingly\nSmall baritone and obviously you're probably going to have a Hispanic nickname right that's kind of a Hispanic\nMan I Would probably be better do yeah I Would I don't know what you would shorten too except\nMaybe that's how I guess I I don't I don't know any um people who are not Hispanic there who are named ... and and this is an opportunity for us a\nPet and do a two white white white ... we're talking Whitey Whitey to the ... the two of the white is people you'll ever know with almost no cultural awareness whatsoever\nTo be learned here\nWe can be you talked about the uh Hispanic culture I mean Beto ... it has been white explaining us ah some Hispanic culture here over the past few months\nBut I Would like to know from people who actually grew up in these areas is it true that every one I'm sure there are some examples I can think of one off the top of my head whose name Robert Francis a work in calls himself Beto but is there is this a common thing to the point of\nI Believe his standard was everyone who gets ... named one of those names in Texas or in in this community needs communities would be referred to as bad [laughter] is it possible in theory unicorn out there that is named Robert and his only called Bob\nIs there's someone out there who is named Albert is called al ... is that is that a unicorn is that I missed the call being or does that exist eight eight seven to seven back eighty eight Seventy seven to three to five if you happen to be someone named Robert airborne\nIn El Paso or grow up in El Paso or lower mckell and yeah I mean more along the border are wrong the border in ... in southern Texas somewhere or I ... I suppose it would also apply in Arizona right now where are our foreign ya\nYeah any any I mean he didn't he limited it to I Would say Texas border area but I Would I'd be interested to see if this is a widespread phenomenon yeah is it possible cannot ... mother\nNamed their kid Gilbert and not have them referred to as best show their entire life is that a possibility I don't know I Am just not in tune to the cultural development as much as I should be and you know please\nCome in and and white explain this to us because we are just ... that's not a role here that we're just two white and understand things like that to to let ... let me let me in the oddest admitted to me\nThe ... referring to himself as Beto feels like a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I I Know that can't be true because but it's just because I'm too white to understand it I Can't quite get their cat clear that hurdle to understand why someone would do that\nAnd we will soon find out to see if we can find any any Roberts who are actually Robert\nSo it looks like we have a a Joel Robert ... no doubt is Beto calling from El Paso I'm Joe Robert yes fear or is it is it more preferred for us to refer to you is Beto\nI think credible that amazing because why he made a speech about the NFL where he said it was okay to Neal because they are I guess that there is exactly what you are or American and that I can I can think of that law or American than that a lot I I don't uh I don't think I understand it\nBut maybe we'll get more evidence from El Paso and this will show us that there's only two there's only two people wouldn't possibly disagree with the story from Beto O'Rourke in these communities\nI'm Glad we've heard from a couple a because it proves that unicorns do exist but we'll we'll figure it out and we'll we'll locked out here coming up to relate them twenty seven back is the phone number or Glenn of courses or traverse the Mediterranean Sea then coming back across the Atlantic ocean in a canoe\nAnd when it gets back he will join a traveling circus this weekend if you want to check out the dates you can find those out\nI don't know if they're gonna be by Glenn Beck dot com slash tour he will if you go there you can find the dates to our tour where we're going out around the country\nUh but I don't know if the this weekend's traveling circus that Glenn will be hosting is going to be listed there but you could look for it in your community as well or he'll be back on Monday a ... ... talk about they caught a little bit here bitcoin was down forty percent gosh it was only over just a just a year ago it was down to Eighteen fifty a coin\nAnd uh you know you forget what the huge run it hadn't leap year that anyone who invested back before the giant spike of bitcoin is still up a whole lot three and four times their money from just a little over a year ago\nHey it's hard to imagine that that uh this whole run has it could've been profitable that late now she could to Ari from Palm Beach letter wrote an announcement or talking about how it would bring an enormous amounts of money into bitcoin are at the time it was Eighteen fifty a coin he said they couldn't wait ten thousand a well as you know it went up to twenty thousand it's still almost seven thousand now which\nIs a much almost up to his ... but the level he was saying it was going to get to it to its peak\nOr a T cutting out a like last year another big event is happening he thinks bitcoin can go up by ten times or more if it does it would be nice knowing you'll you'll never hear my voice again um but [laughter] I really hope he's right on this one\nBut the point is or if you want to know about these things you have to make sure you're educated crypto currency is obviously been a huge development\nNot only and find in the financial world but in the technology world you know a huge corporations are dumping money into this into developing these ... these ideas on black chain you need to know the details about it\nAnd we've been saying this for a long time ... ... if you a hundred bucks we could skip a night out of the you know dinner movies and drink you could get a hundred bucks thrown into bitcoin could turn into thousands or if it's already happened and in very recent history\nOr what you need to know the details you shouldn't invest if you don't know what the heck you're talking about don't be me a smart grid to of course dot com is the place to go go to smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven P.

[laughter] Oh yes\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called bird that which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that do personally oh you do I where\nI used to work for the NBA no Paso as a secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started as a time in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt was when I came on the a lot of my information 'cause I knew what was going on and stuff is costing my desk and everything when I found out that\nBad though was\nRunning for Senate I knew he had used the veterans as a launching point and they need to do with them under the bus\nWell ah to get his name to get his name nationally known and by the way my call him personally myself I come in ...

I don't know uh it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he has put on every single sign slowly\nBefore letters B.

double digits situation happens there yeah look at again North Dakota's a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and you know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is one we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that the United states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got\nIn a democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way when you vote against\nYou still use argument saying okay the Catholics were not
