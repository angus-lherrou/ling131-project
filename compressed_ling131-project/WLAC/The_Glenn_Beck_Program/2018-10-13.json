Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nObese you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be from Ramirez or from Amman ... client was her name sweat Nick\nI mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have yours are high\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you L. rush but but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media you should have the best that and podcast\nOr should have the ... and ... [laughter] hey my point is a\nToday a with Hillary's comments at a base of liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility for barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society is always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards the middle of the barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact and most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party and ... what was it when that was all button and fine and dandy one more thing that\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nNone of what they want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were in the Democratic party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh issue was a labor laws and um when\nYou were what purpose my putting the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism\nHas been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means\nMy point they're not that different there just mass getting less today\nHere if you know read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah ... be met

they're talking about how we we we we've got to be careful because people are going to be hurt because we're too where we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that there's no other way it's a little put a stop on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August that got my eyes at what we saw chasing we've right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls what do you call that civil protest or that I'm off I think if he is only a mob yeah and if there was a party or as we call it a ... come on\nI ... I mean 'cause I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court and banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their\nChildren you know and the homemade signs how many people they chase down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't\nDo you remember where they tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington D. C. would not have been pretty it would not have\nBeen pretty by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob they're charging ... ... and they're taking over that's a huge and that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quota is a mob of protesters that their usage\nSo is this not a disorderly crowd of people that are trying to what\nIt was a A N could goes hands on causing trouble in tents on causing trouble I mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not causing trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nJust as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media\nDoes not see harassing conservatives that's causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a currency that that's like the you know there it's basically you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good\nFor the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that you know [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they are [laughter] Irish guy over our [laughter] let me tell you the white people white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob me yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protest as mob rule here it is\nProtest is guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife said things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his route as he said knock the crap out of them are what you and say okay that's not the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push\nProtesters guaranteed to\nSorry sorry [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThe the [noise]\nHere's here's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says\n... I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhen I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which state's college was nearly killed the guy shooting a football field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot glasses almost go he was yelling this is for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and that's why ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to think\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed [noise] and uh that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation and those who are actually getting their face we have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this ...\nYes they would claim that like border enforcement right idea that's border enforcement that allow afferent than\n... yeah the ... the law they're claiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism I'm a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities well who could that be [laughter]\nI was I I Know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that\nReligious majorities it's the left conservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the United states toward socialism yep did that one because that's what's\nHappening that's what did happen I ask a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah that's a it's a crazy accusations rice point many on the left warn that fascism is taking root in America no\nSocialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people in the less they fascists every time someone do something they don't like right it's like the ... fascism it that is it socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline we're all socialist now that's what's sleeping is sweeping the nation\nAre parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties oh that is an understatement of the air conditioner that live out the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but I did one way to describe you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely\nInaccurate but as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today political rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies sparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism\nOr the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more hang on [noise]\nYou know radio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W.

I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against\nA all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade\nAnd they actually end up rioting and killing people okay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIf that were essentially it was a an industrial workers of the world of ... thank you\nOkay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for\nAuto light strike the west coast long shore strike do you even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth through October twelfth\nThat one's shutdown San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\n... probably from conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle of the overpass the republic steals strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots have\nCommunist and Marxist fingerprints on them\nI said it's it's fundamental to the ideology right revel yesterday is fundamental to the ideology is or is it surprising that this was happening again ...

program back doing\nI Am a I'm very good very good I I mean there is a a interview with ah\nOur first lady a today and I believe our first lady has a displayed grace and a great composure a and I don't care how you feel about the president I think enough is enough with Melania Trump\nI mean I don't see her I'm\nIn a position where she's being vilified on a daily basis by the press space sniping her for a long time I'm very charming woman a very intelligent um loves children\nUm I think she's done a very good job as first lady and there's really no reason to disparage malaria Trump you\nKnow it it my breaking point was last week when she was over in Egypt and she was over in Africa yeah and the the photos coming back of her were beautiful\nI mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread\nAnd all the press could do was if they published any of those photos or they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap alone I Know uh and then I came here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman\nIn the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie oh\nLove Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine but no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump on\nYou know of course she couldn't go out\nTo their cocktail parties and all that it it it there you do your commentary on the political correct ... percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media yes\nI like the idea here at eight or is that correct\nAs ... uh let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the size which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying\nWe in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that are tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they sent they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nA because she was a victim of something\nAnd he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year [noise] All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay now that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened to Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I didn't really made him I was an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on and he was brooding right okay\nSo he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it All right so kind of goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat\nAnd and no one likes him and he ... he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine\nUm then because of that Trump invites them to the oval office work ... walks in with the hat and and uh does ... the president or whatever they did mhm okay\nNow why isn't anyone chair\n[laughter] thank you for sale CNN his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what do you want I\nKanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump All right and she\nTold everybody in Tennessee out and get them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is no I don't\nAnd no one else does either this is a tremendous example a political correctness\nThat tiny tiny it was just going against the PC so he must be vilified\nSo I Want to do I want to I Want to come back because you I Need to get maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to get a little a little more animated here bill car but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about cars you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like Beto\nUh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers seem to be falling apart I think that there is a change a foot and the Democrats don't see it and when they get their head handed to them\nOr by the people I think they're going to double down yet again we'll get Bill O'Reilly's\nComment on that coming up and just a second Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com his new book is out it is a killing the assets\nAnd it is really good it's worth the read a pick it up and and read it is really really good [noise] alright zipper critter\nZipper critter is smart technology and um it is it's really brilliant what they've done they have a really brilliant CEO\nA and he's a high tech guy and it's you know when when separate could it first came out it was a way for you to not have to have an HR department or you could you could post a job on all of the different websites well since that point the super critter has become the number one website\nSo now they not only post everything there but they have all of this internal data\nAnd they really listen to the smart technology really tries to find out exactly what you're what you're looking for so if if you have you know a big job open up and you know PR director or whatever it is you don't mind finding you know seeing the right person if they're in California and you're in New York\nBut if you're you know a Starbucks and you're looking for a brief the you don't care that you know you're in New York in somebody's in Santa Monica you need the person right across the street\nSo they don't just dump everybody a onto your onto your plate\nThe smart technology goes through and really looks forward also they look for the people that are not necessarily out there a scene you know your ad or reading
