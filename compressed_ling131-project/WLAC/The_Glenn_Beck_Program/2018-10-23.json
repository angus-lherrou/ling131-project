[noise]\nBack to the Tennessee report with the tail and Mike [noise]\n\n[noise] yeah morning this is the ... star Ford I'm Steve deal Michael Patrick Leahy with us as well Tennessee's start dot com that's tendencies start dot com on the Web or you can find links to some of the stories that we are talking about today we've been talking a little bit about the early voting explosion that we've seen in Tennessee and across the country US News and World Report I didn't even though they were still in business I\nI I think that's one of these operations you can buy for a dollar and the assumptions liabilities\nAnd the liabilities would cost you more than the dollar yes ah anyway US News World Report has a story about the early voting explosion with some interesting statistic from around the country while election day still just two weeks away\nMore than five million people have already cast ballots in this year's midterm general election with a number of states experiencing record levels of early voting according to US News in Indiana home to one of the crucial US Senate contest where you're seeing Mike Braun\nGain and perhaps slightly move ahead having all over the GOP guy I'm shocked that donnelley's even in in contention and I'm not\nI'm not is drawn that ...\nHe he did a wonderful job\nIn the primary he ... you know he's the guy who had this little that these two opponents who are GOP congressman who were about the same and he walked around the state with kind of a stand up\nA a a a cardboard image of both of them [laughter] and he put a cheap put them next to him and he talk and they'd be in in uh in suits and he would just be in his church jak and he was not for her it was very good in the primary he defined as opponents he's not done such a great job in the general against Donnelly\nAnd Donald he's doing what you're saying Phil Bredesen Jones and others trying to claim their moderates that they're going to work with Trump when it makes sense that you know again it's all baloney just like you've got that isn't here in Tennessee but but that's the game plan they're following and we'll see it\nIndiana voters get fooled in any of that residents in centrally located Hamilton County in Indiana are casting ballots at a rate equal to the two thousand sixteen presidential election while in Minnesota\nWhere we have the Minnesota son the Minnesota sun dot com where you can check out the news from Minnesota uh they're hosting a trio of competitive U.S House races a Senate race or two and a and a governor's race\nTo Senate races a governor's race the attorney general race where Keith Ellison is embarrassing yourself all over the state uh and then ... really are there for competitive house races are in the eighth district in the northern part looks like the GOP guys moving away there\nBut then in the the three and in the south the first second and third ah looks like a couple of a GOP guys are in trouble in the second and third there\nWell in early voting there has surpassed ballots returned in two thousand sixteen so huge turnout in Minnesota in Georgia which as one of the more competitive governors races the year ballots are being returned at three times the rate of the two thousand fourteen mid term so\nHuge turnout we're seeing the same thing here in Tennessee uh you've got a over four hundred thousand early votes cast and we've been trying to talk this morning about the the reasons are are people voting early who traditionally vote on election day are we simply saying people move up because of enthusiasm on both sides when they're voting in the early voting process\nI'm normally a second maybe a third week guy and I voted yesterday Dana and uh took her granddaughter ... they went and voted yesterday you voted over the weekend\nOr people voting earlier in the early voting process and maybe ... what is it appears is happening versus actually greater turn I mean you and I always vote\nIn ... always about seven three seven nine five to two are voting early this year when you normally vote on election day are you somebody who typically doesn't vote\nOur government and Donald Trump needs to tell Mexico if\nThat caravan arrives at our border you receive zero eight zero\nWe will cut off all aid you are to stop this in your country is not to hit our border this is not our problem nor our fight\nZero aid to Mexico if this hits our border it is time we stand and make it very clear crystal clear not our problem is zero aid to Mexico\nOr we're going back\nAt the time that you wrote to appreciate Donald Trump because Donald Trump\nWill stand against this now let me ask you when's the last time you saw Seventy five hundred people a mass with another flag to cross a border\nI Would say would probably have to be if you were in the military crossing into Iraq from Kuwait now do you remember the reason why we had to wait to go into a right you just don't land in go\nBecause you need to logistics and the logistics of moving a crowd that size is a nightmare otherwise it becomes a death march because people are going to get tired they're going to fall they're going to be dehydrated you don't stop at a seven eleven\nSeventy five hundred people to get some water\nWhere's just the water coming from where where is the emergency aid for those who are falling ill along the way ... where are they going\nTo the bathroom have you ever gone to a McDonalds as you're traveling across the country and a tour bus has just pulled in and that has fifty people and you're like oh jeeze you\nAin't going to the bathroom there if Seventy five hundred people rolling the town\nWhere all the bathrooms that they're using\nWhere are you stopping for food\nNobody's controlling logistics wow\nMedia this is truly spontaneous and on miracle I'm expecting God depart the borders for them because God surely must be involved to keep them alive for this exodus away from pharaoh\nOn believable\nWe welcome to the program Mr pat gray hello pat\nWow the hatred I just was a party to just was deluged [laughter] as as I Know I Know I Know wow\nWhat does the president do\nI you know ... ... the only thing you can do is send the military where do you what do you suppose said they'd cut it all oh yeah you have held on right now but if they right here if they get here the military is the only solution you\nCan't let them in no way it's Seventy five hundred people look at they they try to handle it\nOn the southern Mexico border yeah they ... they ... they just rushed into yeah\nSo if I could ah demise CNN impersonation briefly so what you're asking for them to just start shooting and killing all the people [laughter] that's what that's a fair you know riot riot police ah with tear gas and yes if you have to rubber bullets\nYes sometimes those hurt I Know they don't wells the well the well and you know I ... some people might die some people might die don't come over here yeah don't do it okay we have let's just say this\nWe have Seventy five hundred people that want to release people out of our prisons\nAnd so they're just going to rush the gates Seventy five hundred people want to the officers do do they\nTry to fight them off does the does the criminal justice system sending more troops and tried to fight those people from storming the gates and opening up our prisons\nWell we wouldn't want that I mean some people could get hurt\nWhat do you what are we talking about\nWell if they're Seventy five hundred people and they want to go into a small town\nAnd Rob every single restaurants truck stop bank because they're Seventy five hundred of them and there's not enough police in these small towns where we just going to let them take all of the money\nOr do we say no this is a mob this is ...\nA group of Seventy five hundred people who are stating they are going to break the law\nAnd they've already done it and they're just crossing in an overwhelming we did we would never let anybody do that to any other thing why would we allow them into our country\nWe wouldn't let them into our towns just to\nJust to take over our towns we would we would never allow this to happen can you imagine W seemed just the waste and the garbage left behind you know it's amazing they are just crashing everything along the way\nWhat are we supposed to put up with that too you just come into our town and just crash it and then we have to clean up the mess after you\nAnd the question not being asked enough is [noise] why are they are so many young men no no no no no those already for\nYour own you know no no those are just women young women and children that are ... forced\nTo look like in like ... year old men yes yeah who should be defending their own country yeah who should be making their neighborhoods better who should be fighting for their own country\nHave you noticed how have you noticed how the media is just calling these guys migrants yeah and knocked Marxist protestors because that's what this is this is a Marxist protest their their Marxist government which was in bed with the Castros in Cuba\nManure oh in Venezuela they were ousted in a coup because they were destroying the country they were ousted\nJust as ... has done in Venezuela correct same thing\nSo they were ousted what happened\nThey get pissed off\nThey start coordinating with the door Owen Castro and the ousted president they have been disrupting their own country now they want publicity they want this to be a world stage and so they started coming up towards America They're not looking\nFor jobs they're not looking for a better life this started as\nThree thousand people who wanted to make a Marxist point to embarrass their own country because they got rid of a Marxist dictator\nWe're just going to we're fine with that we're just fight with these people coming in really what will they do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nAll the media doesn't care about any of that and do the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they ... they just want\nThem here as voters already they're sending out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats are in Texas of set out but voter registration forms to illegals all over the state inviting them they've already filled out the the uh citizenship box Bush get they check the S.\nAnd sent this out to non residents all over the uh all over the state\nThere's we had the governor is to increase their power base we have the governor of the state coming on and just a minute we have Greg Abbott's coming out at about ten minutes or we're gonna talk a little bit about the uh the massive rally for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump uh yesterday in Houston it was\nThe battle of who we can\nFreaking war time favorite traffic coming up on TALK radio not eight point three Fifteen ten W well lazy\n\nClaim\nThat rally last night was uh something to behold here in Texas it was ... I Can't pick\nA ... if I just\nWant to give you a reminder when Barack Obama first got into office the remember he was doing these giant stadiums\nAnd thirty thousand Seventy thousand people would show up soon as he was elected by the midterms remember they were shooting the fact I have video of it today they're doing it again they're not shooting from behind so you don't see the crowd\nAnd Obama is out and he's in you know these these rooms that are like four hundred people maybe ... maybe cops two thousand\nAnd they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms because his crowds went away here we are at the midterms and Donald Trump still has these gigantic crowds and and\nListen to what can we played Sarah the audio that was played on the loudspeakers outside of the rally last night and Houston listen to this\nBy my house [laughter]\nFamily finally porn I mean\n\n\n[noise] I Can't believe we have to have\nThose announcements are but we we did um and the crowd was more than enthusiastic\nIf I was a Robert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name oh ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um [noise]\nI don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate\nOr for any quarter and history thirty eight million dollars for Beto just for him that's right on that link\nThat's not including the ... money that is going into this state outside a pack of money and say I have tons of that um so uh we're going to talk to the uh Governor Greg Abbott we're gonna talk to him a little bit about the care of and and also about what's happening\nHere in our state he's also running for reelection but his he's so far ahead of any contender he is really the greatest\nGovernor I have ever\nI've ever lived under I mean I've never had a governor of a state that I've been more proud of\nA than a Greg Abbott um and\nObviously a lot of Texans feel the same way because it's a I mean it's a run away campaign for him\nBut the state of the state and the election when we come back then Governor Greg Abbott\nGlenn back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen ten double the ... the\n[noise] I think of it at ... here in both of them are from\nHarvey practical tap tonight I saw your sample ballot and pregnant with a guy in my racket ball\nArgument that in your home your sample ballot provide that information and I got my county board of elections but go\nRush Limbaugh weekdays at eleven on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen ten when you well ac [noise]\nWe're thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with us now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going good\nIt's always good to talk to you I'm ... I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive\nTurnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWhere this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're seeing with regard to the turnout is a national records are not just for mid term elections which is what this is a but in many of these locations\nAre the first day of voting exceeds the amount of votes that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote with another was part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure people who simply to stop it uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas it would be clear about the future of America but you could not sit on the sidelines this election here because there are other people out there who were casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nMe to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a lot of times people have said this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I've\nAlways hated that praise but in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say\nYou know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nWell he he captured the U.S it was very correctly because it just to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent undergo label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a is an out and now he says he is a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the left in the same things happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open quarter policies\nThat is socialism or with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is socialism handle these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it and Venezuela weather report it in place your way to Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nDon't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close\nThe state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into the state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand that there's a George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles [noise] uh two years ago he gave a ... million dollars not directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that you as bonded these ground games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have often you have El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the passion of freedom that bashing the liberty or in the fashion of conservatism and so\nUh because your future is at stake but today for example when we hang up I'm headed to a Belgian ... GO Campaign for some people they aren't going to be a in Dallas County later on today I'm going to be in ... county later on a in a week and then parents\nPut it in ... north Texas and in South Texas He's Texans who wants to talk to or to make sure that we win these elections from the talk of the ballots are the bottom of the ballot\nGreg always go to good stuff do you think you'd go to appreciate it God Bless you God Bless you have to stay\nGovernor Greg Abbott of Texas by the way to Texas a matters or to you [noise]\nTexas goes blue [noise]\nYou then have New York\nYou don't win an election again [noise]\nAh they have taken the electoral college uh every single time [noise]\nTaxes must remain bread and for another reason we're creating\nAnywhere between thirty and fifty percent of all of the new jobs in America are coming out of Texas [noise]\nWhy do you think that's happening [noise]\nOnto this half hour is life lock for more than three years software vulnerability and Google Plus social media network\nGave third party developers potential access to users private profile information more than a four hundred and Ninety thousand users shared private profiled data with a friend\nThey may have had their act their files access to Google says no evidence any data has been misused but it can be misused at any time\nWith your personal information from data exposure criminals can open accounts file tax returns and buy property\nSo many threats in today's connected world it just takes one weak link and criminals are in that's why there's the new life lock identity theft protection it adds to the power of Norden security to help protect against the threats to your identity and to your devices that you're not even able to see on your own\nNow nobody can stop every cyber threat prevent all identity theft or monitor all transactions at all businesses but life luck with the new Norton Security can see threats that you might\nMiss on your own so called life ... now one eight hundred light flock or life locked dot com life lock dot com or one eight hundred lifelike use the ... back\nGet an extra ten percent off your first year plus an additional twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with annual enrollment that's promo code Beck terms and conditions do apply [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten ...\nI've been there I Know what it feels like and that's when I decided to do something about it after lifting my home with some agents that just could not get the job done I decided to start a company that would find the best agents people you could trust people who had\nYour same values honesty hardworking carrying we started real estate agents I trust dot com it came from personal frustration and nine and now your frustration real estate agents I trust dot com our goal is to connect you with an agent\nWho will help you sell your home as quickly as possible and for the best price when you wanna sold sign your front yard fighting the right real estate agent is the key and it's working houses that had been sitting on the market for months are now selling people are finally able to take that big burden off their shoulders another open house some more balloons it doesn't work get moving\nNow go to real estate agents I trust dot com where our individually selected agents will work two or in your business and sell your home real estate agents I trust dot com\nYou get from Mallory lane to Madison\nTime saver traffic follows Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W.

I think you should all these things do you are innocent until proven yet either Simon charges against Cory Booker one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every day up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor's but we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to have let's why innocent until proven guilty it's a thing\nA and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism by the time these relationships break up and there's things that and who knows\nThere's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed cabinet should be you know I don't put in prison or what happened so\nInteresting here is the Democratic party has completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations ... it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time and he's she's credible\nShe's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind\nJimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports at the time\nUh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party light she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't right if I wanted to win this crazy yeah it's an amazing mind so that one forty three thirty six is a surprise\nI mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a here looking at\nRight now a forty four feet are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a few it's forty six excuse me forty effect if you add in the solid Republican seat than leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head they're a\nVibrant and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than he did a few a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got a another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're gonna be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull off fix them six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past ah so\nYou know at that level of whether it's ah him and they could lose it to that could easily still lose it impossible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six this is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers\nOn the way he was a pro Arab or twenty third that is that going back program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even\nConsidered it to really know well you know that which is er out putting X's Donald Trump\nYou know and which is our I did not know that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and and Ted Cruz and others and what are they what are the\n... one of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kinda brushed off myself I'm In I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women need to be aware of what's coming up and just going\nStories a\nA\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has in Greece states gold reserves by one thousand percent\nIn a due to increasing quote safety concerns this is the first time since Nineteen eighty six that Hungary's central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons of gold\nAh they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying are moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold in their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... who knows that\nAre hungry in Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans\nWere the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years\nShe's bought it from Goldman were that a lot easier right why us for it back when it doesn't really exist [noise] the reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word\nAnd write this down on no matter who do the very high path occasion thing again are you I'm just saying that right yeah\nWhen you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear people actually talking about well the problem is ... that's when you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so\nThe only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss ... that's when you run for the hills okay\nAnd I don't know about you but\nThe gym problem at my house yeah in a problem for a long time by you almost never wear a headscarf well no it's for ladies only oh okay yeah for ladies only sold in Tanya doesn't wear a headscarf and I come home I'm tired I worked our day and I get home and I'm like\nAs a gym falling in love with

genius how they just granted wishes that they're evil care I don't know I don't know I I don't know if I ever see like a teapot idle rub it to have the genie come out\nWhich is strange because why he's trapped when there was an opening right there in the you know in the in the lantern there's an opening right there\nRight and I I think I Would make the same point whiz\nWith the cloth device first of all cloth does not seem difficult to penetrate but secondly there is an opening for the I mean the the genie could just go ahead go right through there to get into the head of the person right now they don't I mean just from a pragmatic now they do perspective you just go right through there as long as you're wearing\nGloves a full body you know are covering and then your head is wrapped and you're just have the eyes\nNow your ice can be used to a a lower a man or even just if the eyes if you look at him and just write you can say you know it's not like you know look how they're dressed it's look how they were looking at me or on her and so you can uh you know you can be\nBe which if you will by ... by a woman's eyes I think even in this in lightened me to era we can all come together and say if a woman looks at you you know what are you going to do right exactly I mean you\nKnow exactly right this is especially if she's been possessed by a gym [laughter] I mean you know this is the\nThing we were talking about this off the air a little bit 'cause you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we're talking about nationalism and well in the definition of nationalism in history is is at times very disturbing ... um however ... you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we are trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look where the best country and we were routed and we have a ... the best you know culture and went and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be ... up you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you\nWhen you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I can say that because you've\nProbably been possessed by a gym or ...\nThis is the gym tolerated and now it's a different kind of a threat was I had a lot of of didn't talk they were in my life [laughter] hey it's travel yeah it is and it gets you into believing in the bottle adds up ... sixty shots of\nBeer on a program recently alive on the air right it'd be an issue but I think I'm OK thing that a culture that embraces women as equals he's superior to a culture that that puts them we won't let them drive and and forces them to address the specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean\nThey might ... those are all just social construct\nMaybe it's just a good social ... sometimes things are built and they're good to know the good piece of can no you're not you're not from the west not from the west which\nBrings me back to the caravan when we come back [noise]\nLand back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than double the ... the\nLights on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W. I. lazy [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] you're listening to ... [laughter]\nSo let's talk about the caravan for a second because we really need to decide what we think about this and\nWe're going to do about it what do you think we should do about it and you need to have this conversation with all of your friends right now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are\nPolitical Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag in protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them as they're marching towards our border they're not refugees they chose to leave their country they're finding their country they were trying to get a do a political stunt so what what are these people where did they get the money\nWho's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way\nWho's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't march twenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing medical aid who's providing the water\nWho's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this video\nBut if we could play this a video or if you have it the the video of a these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks they're being trucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nAnd you pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers and it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk down by like that's not how that happened but now they're getting out there grouping up there ... for a couple of miles to cameras get them\nThen they get back in trucks and get an injury that Dr\nLook at the ... video game ... video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck [noise]\nJust count them even just count them as the right now because of how the uh well you know all of them counted right one all of them counted one ... one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the one there was an a on the um\n[noise] one Mm okay now so this isn't women and children who are these people are we know that MS MS Thirteen now has embedded the people in to this group I mean now Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one uh\n\nYeah I think it's a I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation\nThen how does it play how was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and\nBut I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have\nThousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in ... words for America can\nYes ... you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and it's a turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou see this is an invading force these people\nThey're not come into our legally [noise] now the media is trying to\nSay wait a minute wait a minute this is an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away\nThey didn't like that they decided they had to put a shutter on it and then they started looking for shutters that would make the right noises so when I went to church and close you could hear it and then they had to find the right material that could do it you know five thousand times without any kind of wear and tear on it\nThat's the work that simply said puts into your system you own it and there is no contract for the monitoring and the monitoring is only fourteen dollars Ninety five cents a month that's it you get ten percent off your system and you won't believe how inexpensive it is it simply safe back dot com ... ... ... or protect your family\nOr and trust to the company that we trust for our business and for our home simply safe back dot com go there now simply safe back dot com [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ... lazy [noise]\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now not into relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain\nQuite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or\nPlaying golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know\nThe majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to go to relieve factor dot com\nOr Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W. I. lazy\n[noise] gland back [noise]\nYou know we had a we have ... we had a governor a avid on with us and he said mixed inside of that seven thousand you know my grand caravan\nAre\nMS MS Thirteen leadership and members\nEmbedded in there are these are actual gang rape is\nNow I'm waiting for the left I Can't wait for the laugh to pounce on this how dare you say that gang rapists are in that care of him when they had absolutely no problem\nCalling someone else a gang rapist without proof just recently not a problem I thought that was okay no I yeah I thought that was fine and with him is Thirteen they are getting rapists we know they are\nCertainly some of them are for sure well I think that's part of any anger and some of them are rape is yeah I think\nThat's part of the thing of getting in you have to you have to rape to to join the race and kill\nA pass on this year's the subscription I I I don't need the members show guarded free though all you have to do ... you know saying no thank you kill is what are they going to go a different direction okay has MS twelve available you know no no no no [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's a I mean you know we've talked about this before\nMS Thirteen the United states constantly is is this is just a Donald Trump fever treat this is nothing this is not a big deal\nWhere they're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings\nSo if you think of him is Thirteen isn't an issue\nYou probably don't think school shootings or an issue\nWhich I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in their ... say that again coming that way you don't come in that way that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nThat it's not are not hateful they've if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a\nBlack Friday and say oh my gosh people are animals\nGetting into a Walmart yeah\n... that's what this is going to be Seventy five hundred people trying just to push through an opening those doors\nThat's all I Do and I listen to Black Friday Wal Mart says it going to be fascinating to watch because there was a good chance that you know as a rabbit talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're gonna try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome that are not on our borders 'cause you know what that is\n\nThat's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that attend not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and\nI heard an UN's going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor tech I I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know some reason to believe it's possible but let's see if it\nDoesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border this thing is going to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are are National Guard of the\nWorst people on earth and are not going to stand for it and people are generally I met him than for Seventy five hundred people trying to run over I Hope our border guard either they're not ... that is a that's going to be a real mess where he just goes way [noise]\nYeah that's how I deal with my problems I Do I don't think it's really up to Mexico\nThem more lose all day in\nAnd do a play and the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative\nVideo content um that out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by this that company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they ... they are\nBut um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else well what we're trying to\nDo is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some running and conservative content so we said\nYou know we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we wanted to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board and obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so in what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view ... to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your contest\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um [noise]\nUh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we\nNeed a conservative Facebook no we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there\nSo how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first kick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this is a Bernie Sanders ... light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys named it was all about the content\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really weak mobile application makes it easy for people to interact with the ...\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nThey can't sell that we can sell the libertarians to Staci into older and you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty some things that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there is a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think is the time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having to be a conservative publishers on board um an does banding together you know with this program we're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmaker and go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch\nTopics with you because you know you've consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera\nBut do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no wave\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing what the election as the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media sang\nIt's always about local that as a as the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism is not going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think the Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the currency just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door of the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nI hate to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up stop it\nI mean I think the president's made it clear where either country of laws or or not and it it you know the the ruse that they're using that this is\nUm it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers well they're asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't\nEven know if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately a refugee and I got to Mexico and Mexico was willing to hear my case or process me\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's not this is about politics and who's funding them yeah it's a great issue but I'm\nThe president should stand strong and stop it if they make it that far [noise]\nAll right the or the name of the ah athletes flushing went this week\nYeah launching this week you can go to the ...\nDidn't talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W LA's the\n... [noise] [noise]\n[noise] fast plant that probably am how it should listen to this resume [noise] guys and carefully ... he's a lawyer for porn stars [laughter] okay yeah\nYou know ... Michael ... okay\nHe's a lawyer for polling porn stars she has been at the front lines of some of the craziest people around uh including the oh yeah he was running a ... a you know a gang rape ring when he was fourteen took that clients he took ... okay [noise]\nUh yesterday uh we can add to his resume\nThat he suffered to court losses\nA one a judge ordered him to pay four point eight five million to a former lawyer or who Michael ... had already lost the court case\nAnd ... and settled on ten million dollars she still owes them four point eight five ... you know he was taken to court for the additional money and the judge was like yeah dude you settled on this this is already a court case you settled you have to pay that okay so\nAdded to his ... resume one he uh didn't pay somebody was sued settled broke the law tried to get around it and was forced a second time in court\nAlso and she lived another judge in another case a said that he and his staff have to be a victim from their offices the you know attorney offices or because he hasn't paid rent for four months\nNow\nWhen you look at a resume like that some might say failure yeah trouble massive failure I say next democratic\nPresidential nominee [laughter] I mean and the qualifications now he doesn't know how to manage money he's getting a victim because he's not paying his bills he doesn't listen to the courts and what they say if he doesn't like any just something else hangs out with foreign START I mean it's the sounds great\nBut it's a fundamentally this is like you created Frankenstein monster this is from scratch the Democratic now than it was like if you could design it with DNA and invest in them yeah so there is one other thing that I Would just like to point out that I\nI found [noise] I don't know maybe\nAppropriate for an attorney like him uh that uh his offices were in the fashion island mall ... and I don't care how nice you know if you're if you're if you're attorney's office smells like\nA you know\nA Auntie Anne's pretzels yeah I think I just don't think he should be taken seriously [noise] fairly good voice I don't know if you're trying to\nTo to capture you know born lions like parts or you can't put your office in a strip club right I get\nIt right somewhere to put it where else are really clinically yeah that's a Planned Parenthood [laughter] ... [laughter] they're all good [laughter] but it did after yeah ...\nClosest to the ... side right then\nWe'd be want pretzels you know or you just said man I Love the smell of sin about oh yeah the he's your attorney\nYeah I think so is your turn ... this is interesting 'cause I Wonder after seeing all these things are as they've developed\nIf his moved to the public eye this very loud representation of Stormy Daniels was not just a move of desperation like I'm Out of here I'm going to end corruption I Need to get into the guy and maybe I don't yeah\nI ... other option is to die of drunk\nAlone some play in a bar [laughter] you know I was talking to somebody who is pretty well versed in media circles about this and and about ... a few weeks ago and he's saying that like\nThe the media knows this guy is a nut job they know he's in that job they know he's crazy really they know he is he's not a real player and they actually don't like him they were just waiting for that moment to be able to march him get rid of him and here it is more here they've\nJust now they're all reporting on how all of his finances are terrible them all the background on his on his his ah you know the settlements in court that could've been done months ago you know there there isn't where they're all set with him now there's an interesting didn't work out you know so they moved down to something intriguing he'll be at the Planned Parenthood setting up his office I'm sure so\nI'm sure I'm sure he's got to go some place that listen to this and this is the way the media does these things right looking at it now George Soros reportedly had an explosive device in his mailbox or over overnight mhm which needless to say\nBut we should say it anyway it's a horrific idea if anyone were ever to do that and you are an awful person in every respect or if you were to be responsible for such within other days for the rest for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Nashville", "day": "23"}
