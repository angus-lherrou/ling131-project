less than ten minutes on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W well ac [noise] now more of the Tennessee star\nAt one point\nIn my home during\n\nThe summer for seven three seven nine five if you if you had your voice to the mix of conversation\nYou know we've heard so much Michael in the last week or so about the need for civility despite the fact that you've had folks like Maxine Waters\nWho's kind of disappeared when we need to put out a milk carton or something she's uh she's disappeared from view lately as the Democrats have realized that Maxine Waters getting TB time as we head to the final week of the mid term elections wasn't really helping them so that helped I don't know if they've taken her to an undisclosed location I don't know if they drug ... took her out of the country\nBut she's kind of disappeared Hillary Clinton\nHas been talking about the the fact that after Democrats retake control then there'll be civil then then they will show Seville\nAs your yeah I'm sure there'll be civil we we got another dose of that civility with the actor James Cromwell\nAre being honored do over the weekend at the fourth annual Carney awards\nAnd noted that that we will experience another revolution with quote his his boat blood in the streets unless President Trump's agenda is stored it unless we stop President Trump now they will have a revolution for real there\nWill be blood in the streets James crumble he was the actor that was in ... he was the I'm kind of the gang leap older guy in in ... and then has been I think\nPresident vice president and some some other movies I think the reaction you know for most people in hearing his comments was I thought he was day [laughter] he's not and he's trying to spur a revolution and yet I born you again there are millions of guns in America\nMost of which are in the hands of not the snowflakes but the people who will defend this country defend their families defend themselves\nUm if there is a revolution\nI hate to break it to Mr Cromwell there will be blood in the streets and most of it will be on the snowflake liberal Democrats side if they if they want to go that direction but and and promoting violence is the way they're going to bring stability to our country\nHe that sounded real civil what he said let's turn up the uh he went up ... he wants to play in the streets they're a very safe\nWe don't stop Trump it's all on us if you don't stop Trump we're going to kill ya\n[laughter] that sounds like you're just ... it's in the constitution\nDoesn't isn't that ... if you don't do what we want politically we will cause you harm they will be blood in the streets of America sounds like an ISIS recruiting video there will be blood in the streets of America if you don't take down the Republicans who were securing the border making America stronger making your economy better if you if you don't fix\nWhat's what's working well by breaking it then we're going to hurt you\nWell you know let let's let's say something about Robert De Niro and at least deniro uh just insults the president I pay has ...\nHomeland security and defense secretary Mattis are obviously treating this seriously\nEven though people like CNN or are you know calling these are mocking those who call these are an invasion but what do you call a group of people two thousand four thousand seven thousand strong\nMarching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not while carrying another country's flag ... what what do you call that [noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion because America can control our own borders nearly eight thousand troops\nTo match a four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is and I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo is the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing\nThat men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house\nThey said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not and we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there\nNow if you had a group of people that were marching saying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing what'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know why\nNot common for you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I sure be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act two examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures that's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door and stops all of the side windows and the back door entries\nThe country needs either serious policy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and so far when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program\nDirection by numbers\nA look at election by a numbers hello says do tell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get all the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category um because Poland's been close and now we start to\nTry to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are done it only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident off Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still leaning Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if for Republican sweep thoroughly knows right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss ups bill and we couldn't really\nMoved them or Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was more some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling is a lot closer a really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean Democrat\nDate again this is a tough race 'cause you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a\nMovement towards towards a Nelson in Florida and we now have that one is a lean Democrat state um we've moved from Minnesota as well from faith Democrat to leaning Democrat polling there [noise] yeah [noise]\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer than I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well\nOr was a tough race for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be leaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin leaning Democrat as well so if you if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate [noise]\nThat is the starting but it's a ... it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around you know we see no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia\nAs well which was a big hope for pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin I'll vote yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota high camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThat the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slightly nurse we're moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nIt's an interesting one probably the most calm and can under control that Donald Trump was in the entire election was in the last couple of weeks if you remember he gave Hillary nothing nothing after that tape came out right and that was probably a month before the election last three weeks he gave her nothing\nShe had nothing to say he was crazy on he was I mean as rock solid as he has been as under control is he's been no crazy tweet none of it he didn't play any of those games for the election and that's when he closed the entire gap was down by\nEight in the polls are so ah when after the the tape came out and closed it to a much ... you know tighter margin and wound up winning obviously\nYou know it's funny that seems to be going the other way with right now I mean like he's talking obviously about a lot about the they're talking about a potential\nUh executive order to end birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm it's been more aggressive right and that that may be good it may not be good we're going to see right now\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled\nWith Kevin continue just help me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal you know what I mean ... and he reminds people in a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need that makes sense\nAh yeah I think that's probably true\nBecause he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continued a dog pile and and quite honestly I Wish he would stop the\nPresses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it ... out of control but that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable I think\nWe have to also back up and say that this is not just adjust the Trump election right up to ... ... lecture and for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate where you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it\nI think the issue a overall however uh there's a the momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more\nMovement a dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean I Know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that the way it's going to turn out um it's just it's not you'd hope to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the image like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run for\nTrump and Democrats and Republicans remember they you know a\nMonth before but I'm an eight or nine points they close that gap all the way\nAlmost would pose a so that was not a the momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaning that would get\nOut and vote do not want to sit this election out and get out and vote\nGlenn back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen ten ...\nPickup Rush Limbaugh weekdays at eleven on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W ELL

radio towers bystander insurance talking [noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr pat gray who ah receipts this program on the blaze radio and television networks are and also has his a\nPodcast that you can listen to and download at your leisure welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem well problem it's an executive order I'd agree with them\n[laughter] so you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah it is a justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which\nFinally okay force the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday\nEverything after the tenth amendment basically is a ...\nIt's just ... or or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nPay your debt right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and then I'll stop it yeah here the ... the ... literally Democrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know sneaking in cross that having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here ludicrous that what that was\n... and so it's been an interpreter now all this time\nRight but you can't you can't do it with an executive no but if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court on kind of okay with it yeah\nAnd that's I think that's what would happen there um because of they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be entirely there is yeah I think it would be interesting to see how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in\nWould now rule on the than with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not if it's gonna be fascinating yeah it does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and\nAh and Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh really I mean\nYou can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which it's interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play can we played just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nTo make a decision is

hard core conservative yeah she got her oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not not at least not at that desk\nLike George Soros so how do you weigh that one policy based it hit the policy but and they know\nIt they know they do they're doing the same thing as they were doing with a bird rock Obama when you said wait a minute social if he's a socialist you're a racist for saying that\nYou know don't let this work doesn't make any sense don't like to do this and there's this does not even we're into response or at least a serious response hidden there they have become a joke

HBO\nThe social justice warriors all around them remind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and then in the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know print brave in doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to a ... and I think that that is\nIs one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of it because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened and egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red pills America you can hear it on the ah I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing chef Smith or say there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion what what are your thoughts on the caravan [noise]\nYou know I think that it is something that for whatever reason in the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on\n'em in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nA that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow to construction workers\nThat um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to chew a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this year I think that this caravan it is not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic\nAnd it's going to hurt the the most vulnerable people in the United states well I think it's\nWhat's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know it's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent fuel out of that because a lot of these kinds of\nLabor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis in ... in Los Angeles is is that there is is the drug epidemic there are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that I'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare\nTo fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using then using the the health insurance or\nThey ended up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically ... rehab tourism\nHere in the in the Southern California area that has been a that is it being attributed to the homeless ... of course last you know basically follows me the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to\nObamacare as being part of the reason why uh their kids have gotten out here in Los Angeles and then get end up getting stuck out here\n[noise] um you're covering also one other story I went to a cover with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for Democrats\n[noise] you know we are that we were releasing two episodes on Thursday so um our podcast as launching this Thursday and I are radios or a podcast or to me I Am and one of the episodes is on this question\nAnd we speak to Kansas Owens and diamond in
