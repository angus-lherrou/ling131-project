L. A. C. reader good morning\nMorning I was calling to say that I think it's got to have a Republican I'm Out of black female and shot one person I ever before\nAnd I just thought it lights wait a minute black and I'm the only but my husband and vote for Trump but after he saw that carrying here who all of a sudden\nThe Democrat as well and he also but Marcia and um so I think it's going to have three\nOut of you know now what was the turning point for you read it why why again I mean President Trump was saying to African Americans what have you got to lose ... did that impact your where there are other issues\nIt ... it had an impact and um I've been out a Democrat and I voted for final twice and I didn't see any change it's like a bottle of about trying to make people feel good and ... and and it was like\n... ... immigrants illegal I feel like he came up like that and like you know you need to take care of people home\nShouldn't be I mean it's okay for people to come if they should come lately like all these people comment that I mean that's a lot of people jumping out with people that I Try to come legally you know and then went to India and I'll come on educated and\nAnd it can't English I mean so that's a lot of money that we couldn't do these people get an ... just because I live out\nOn the pattern that show where people don't think that's what they are a lot of Hispanics and and people that moved out there\nAnd the crowd in the schools that you know this goes on the south that there's so many out there and they need you know a lot of the kids don't speak English you know I mean it's kind of take a lot it can get caught it and come there they found them\nAnd and again are they coming to be Americans I mean when they're singing Guatemalan anthem and waving their own lives you know the same thing you see these protest on the Mexican border when these illegal aliens from Mexico here in the United states they're waving their Mexican flag and fine you know in St Patrick's Day we're all Irish but but but it doesn't affect how\nHow they embrace our culture and I think as as you point out Rita it's a lot of African Americans are the ones who were seeing these people take their jobs because they're able to charge less for their wages and be taken advantage of by employers who are using them rather than American workers and\nTo me one of the things President Trump is doing well as saying are we going to put Americans first\nOr illegals first and the Democrats keep wanting to put the illegals first Rita thanks for your call in and keep going and spread the word about the show as well\nOkay thanks let's go to Richard next to Richard in Kentucky is listening in Richard you're on the Thames eastern report [noise]\nHey how you doing today good thank you\n[noise] uh I'm I'm a driver he did what we can get my hair and you know one thing that I like everybody you know it goes away and\nI Know in this country\nBut I have no before the\nAmong Republicans and Democrats you kind of can see what happened in the election again we talked about a two thousand six big win for Democrats well when we went to that election sixty nine percent of Democrats said they had a the highest levels of interest in the election\nSixty nine percent Republicans it was only fifty six percent and Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent\nRepublican a percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked\nUm it's the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and\n... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nFor relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of feet and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and uh and they revealed when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if he were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place then whenever the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing ten feet from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races\nAnd the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nUm you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of Z yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance that this up two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling ... they're in an interesting group because they are not as\nPassionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nNow independence are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket robots typical I'm into doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\n'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent Jim I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left\nHas gone insane right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being right her life was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] it though I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians say don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and we were\n... could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... I mean I Would think they are discussed\nWith what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting ... standing here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this very heavily we talked about ... a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um a Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ninth and she doesn't tend was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason well it is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for\nDemocrats [noise] it I mean\nThe only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied\nMinors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that ... okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would ... the only place this low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine for going into ...\nTen percent off and a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card terms apply\nThat can rape may apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever ageless male Macs a patent pending formula within a greeting if that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases in muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide minutes\nMaking a wrong turn into gridlock shouldn't be one of them die in traffic on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and dean than W. L. A. B. [noise]\nTalk a little bit about Saudi Arabia and what's happening with ah the ... case it it really it ... [noise] have you noticed anybody who says\nAnything other than ah shockey oh the great one ... oh ...\nWith the exception of uh uh hear his name forty seven different ways and that sentence now I have not heard [laughter]\nSo it's it's amazing to me how if you speak out\nYou're a conspiracy theorists now hold on just a second sense when his reporting of fact since winning is quoting him a conspiracy\nI make it seems like the accusation is if you're trying to say that he's ever done anything that's questionable in his life you're making excuses for his murder which of course it's not\nThat it's not no no it's different that's different that's that's the people who are tweeting and saying oh oh so you deserve to die\nNo no no no this is a horrible crime committed by a horrible state who is not our ally\nPerhaps we need them I don't know I don't like to getting into these situations I Wish we weren't there at all but this was a crime and it was despicable disgusting brutal\nI mean unbelievable to people in the west but it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it okay\nThat has no bearing on who he was we can say that this was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people\nFor X Y Z and we can say ... did not deserve to die this way\nNobody deserves to die that that way however he is not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs the Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic\nState he wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post says yeah we have to have a an Islamic assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islam assist rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule sharia law tell me where it's working out\nShow to me where is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by none other group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia\nNo thank you I'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy\nThere was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and we have found is that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue\nBut let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving friends because\nGlenn back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than double the ... the\nGolf Sean Hannity weekday afternoon Vince you on TALK radio da da da and Fifteen ten ... scene [noise]\nTalk a little bit about [noise]\nThis back and forth with Saudi Arabia because it is important that we get this right and we don't make this about American politics we\nShould make this about American interests but not American politics right now people are saying I came away Donald Trump or\nYou know what George Bush Bill Clinton the second George Bush all the way back all the way back to FDR we have been in bed with the Saudis\nI don't like this I think we're in bed with really bad people\nHe's a rattlesnake a bad pet that was asked me once and I love this is a rattlesnake is it a bad bet\nThe answer is no it's a perfectly fine pet as long as you always remember it as a rattlesnake or a snake and not a little puppy dog\nIt's a rattlesnake it's not a bad bet just don't have it and don't\nTry to a fashion Elise ... around its neck take it for a walk it ain't going to do it\nSo\nHow do we handle Saudi Arabia well should be the same way we handle turkey but we're not because we're looking at turkey and Saudi Arabia with American eyes stop it these are both Islamic states now their warring with each other why\nBecause one is Muslim Brotherhood and one is a well hobbyist they don't like each other they want death for\nEverybody in the other state they want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim Brotherhood [laughter] and Saudi Arabia wants turkey stopped because there will hobbyists we're being\nPut in the middle of a fight between to Islam assists both\nOf them want the caliphate both of them want Islamic rule both of them want to rule uh with jihad and they also want to rule which surreal law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those so now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place horrible horrible horrible horrible place they execute kids as long as you've shown any kind\nOf signs of puberty you're tried as an adult they execute through beheading ... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet a about a Saudi were woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each got you know between two and nine years in prison however she she received six months in prison and two hundred and ... with a whip\n\nBecause she was in the car without a without her husband and then she dared to take her story to the media is the kind of people that we are dealing\nWith the crown prince you and I are not going to like this guy\nYou just say oh look at what he's still he's he's making it easier for women to drive without their husband yeah okay yeah sure\nSure sure he's still a lobbyist\n\nLet's look at what\nBoth sides in this country have done [noise] we're currently\nFighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that President Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year\nIt was President Obama that vetoed a bill that allowed families of nine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government\nSo both sides everybody is in protecting these guys when the crown prince came here to America he met with Donald Trump\nOh my gosh but he also met with Oprah Winfrey bill and Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer\nDwayne the rock Johnson for some unknown reason Brock Obama or John Kerry ... rice George W. Bush Henry Kissinger Michael Bloomberg Thomas Friedman from the New York times\nThat you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam assists\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam and his ... believes you have to use sharia law that the constant wow it sounds like the Muslim Brotherhood vats our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood\nTurkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states\nTrue they kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him\nProbably Saudi Arabia did he deserve it no does he deserved to be called a freedom fighter\n[noise] only by either really an educated progressive Z\nOr just liars ...\nLots of this half hour is simply say simply\nSafe home security system for your home home security system uh\nYou know for your business as well uh we have simply safe here at the studios\nAnd uh it protects the the George Washington compass and the and the ruby slippers somebody came in and said ruby slippers there's seven ruby slippers or that were made actually the the um [noise] a\nSicilian has the worst pair\nReally beat up and really pretty nasty the best Paris probably owned by a an individual I think loans them to the Walt Disney studios but ours are protected by simply safe simply say about protecting more than two million Americans you want to do it for rare artifacts well okay\nIt's it's I use it for the family because my family are much more precious than any kind of artifact set up your system within minutes and own it\nThey are really really the best at what they do and uh they're really affordable simply say back dot com go there now check out how much money you're going to save how easy it is and no contracts it simply safe back dot com ... take control of your family security was simply safe back dot com [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ...\nNow that I sleep cool and comfortable every night on Casper I pick it\nOver any mattress I've ever had it's a high quality mattress at an affordable price and its ships free in a small box so you can try it for a hundred nights risk free you don't love it they're going to come and pick it up and refund everything so put Casper to the test in your own home for a hundred nights go to Casper dot com and use the ... back\nYou're going to say fifty bucks towards the purchase of your select mattresses Casper dot com promote go back that's Casper dot com promo go back terms and conditions do apply\nAccording to the department of energy the most expensive utility for most Americans is their electricity bill adding to your financial misery\nThis allergy season has been one of the worst in years so now is the perfect time to order a new set of age back soldiers from filter by dot com with over six hundred scientist to choose from including custom options you'll find the perfect fit ships free within twenty four hours\nWith filtered by dot com they're made in America\n... on my voting hours and ... ... ... ... a full time [noise]\nDuring early voting for him to run around for a hangover harmful\nFor it and find out why so many experienced investors are switching to an staying with Fisher Investments Fisher Investments are clearly better money management investments insecurities involved the risk of loss and visit us it Fisher Investments dot com to find out what we can do for you [noise]\nWhen it comes to facilities maintenance and management league company is the trusted expert you get the best with lead company smart people dedicated partners creative solutions\nOn TALK radio Ninety eight point three man dean then W.

real estate agents high ... dot com\nEvery day it seems like we turn on the news and you have absolutely no idea what's going to go on its war in Syria another mass shooting a terrorist attack another indictment and the Mueller investigation uh mudslides\nLives meaning unhappiness and so I think it's very important to um as far right as they come on the right versus left to continue but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build\nA better mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics is a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nThey are you know they're they are anti capitalist though they are they're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics\nBut at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California how are you aware\nDoes did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly ... because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet\nThat kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal\nThe the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch heads ... pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out\nAnd leading 'em and standing you know\nMartin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking a beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... a a phenomenon is really built\nFor short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and\nAh there's no end to hear and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about and to today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that men are basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content\n... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work\nOr if you disagreed with him about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now and they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still\nReally only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think\nPart of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them [noise]\nSo what is our\nOur we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... ... e pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumptions about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity that way\nBigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless\nWe can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using\nPolitical tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this a and a year looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben Sasse\nHis new book is called them and why we hate each other and how ... will log onto this half hours relief factor really factor has\nBeen I'm kind of around our studios for a while some of the guys had been taken relief factor here for a while a and I got to a place where my pain in the last few years have been it's just been off the charts and\nDidn't know what to do about it anymore I could not go to the doctor and you know hey can you give me some drugs I just don't want to live my life that way and I needed to be able to be out of pain what am I going to do my wife finally said 'cause I'm\nI'm a weirdo I don't believe

I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal hang on weight before short stuff started without many Haitian go in the kitchen absolutely on them and talking about getting rid of all of a centralized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because ... testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do [laughter] that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and that was I proudly Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about where he was really do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that works somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked at the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse let me give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want I Want to make sure that we have some localized central I'm the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that four billion and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows were running granted Minnesotans were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that the two counties I crossed off if you\nGoing to fool sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than a traders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish ... over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve ... K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now he takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college west\nTerrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic we've never had a job it is he's been he's in he's in screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he says Larry my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is people show up at the clock in the morning there's just so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a ... number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the\nProblem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and it for a new computer all day ... that a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and the advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who have not sure about the new doctor you know being a female but that's a different\nDown okay yeah so um so that kid was really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and gets into your degree why should they be boarding school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber a carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing the work\nThey should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in your city doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job why not go learn a work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation or this or if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss\nLearned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five\nLearn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nLoudly sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth\nI'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck his ... his wife ... going to happen\nBunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nBunch of great trade schools will pop up yes how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to me just go top it'll be amazing there's the best part when schools pop up now we're spending\nAnd thousand dollars per kid per year the last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid was saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven sweaters is more than four billion dollars we said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core\nWe've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders added at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this a lemon twelfth grade you're in
