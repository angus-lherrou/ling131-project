I didn't say well you know I just I'm dying to I mean I really think much about it but she is less than one tenth of one percent I think I can Vader I think I can beat her to be there will us for a million dollars from the president to now want it to the no enemy [laughter]\n[laughter] I don't have to find out about it was\nFunny it and you've got a again Lindsey Graham stepping it up\nYeah Lamar Alexander started speaking out more forcefully you've got some of these some of these Republicans are actually stepping up and and and being forceful yeah again this this contagious ... of of winning that Trump is brought to bear is apparently is starting to in fact some of these Republicans\nAs well and and I just like I like the way Lindsey Graham's approaching this now this is going to be one of those Jerry Springer reveal moment and the father is you know he's going to reveal his DNA tests presumably live\nOn the rocks in France and a couple of weeks is going to reveal it how long does it take to do at the end\nI think a couple of weeks in Elizabeth Warren's case apparently it took several months but she had a special case that DNA Analysis was was done in a peculiar way or the DNA sample went to a lab\nNot verified no chain of custody there the lab than put out a a basically a digital report\n[noise] [noise] they actually had an airline hitting economic program\nSo we have Bill O'Reilly coming up in about an hour I'm going to be gone for the next couple of days and [noise] and a bill is going to come in and give us a rundown of the week so far and we have a lot to discuss one of them is Saudi Arabia this story\nIs just getting more and more bizarre let me bring you up to speed in case you don't know\nThe story started a couple of weeks ago with this idea that this Washington Post reporter is suddenly missing well he's not a Washington Post ... a reporter only his name is ... and uh he is a Saudi\nArabian citizen he is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nHis beef with Saudi Arabia in his own what he called self imposed exile is all about the Saudis not befriending and not I'm not excusing the behavior of the Muslim Brotherhood the\nSaudis are very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization and not a friend to Saudi Arabia or really any one in the world\nSo he went into self imposed exile a and he came here to the United states the there are claims that he is he he was still a Muslim Brotherhood operative there are also claims that he was feeding us information\nUh uh uh uh against the Muslim Brotherhood I'm not sure which to believe at this point so he's overseas he's in Turkey and he\nIs going to get married but he's been divorced to his wife in Saudi Arabia for him to be able to get remarried he has to have a a divorce certificate from Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabia and say well you're going to have to come into the embassy to get it now he is not a friend to the Saudi Arabian prince\nThe one who has been this big reformer and he is going to you know take Saudi Arabia into the future and he is good for women and he is good for human rights and everything else\nIs shaggy is not popular with that prince and that prince has not been popular with ... the he had been trying to get Chicago as a ... to come back to Saudi Arabia but ... knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\n... but it's kind of hard to believe\n[noise] the new information today you know is is coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had\nAnd video tape of this man's interrogation or torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake\nI Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if it's if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the\nThe execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... an conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel\nWe should get evidence there is there any ... over international relations with the past Twenty years of age should make sure we have these things right yes there's also it's not an imminent it's not like okay it's weapons of mass destruction for example to use one that works in this context where\nWhere we could be facing an imminent threat\nOf you know a bomb going off at a place that kills a lot of people that you know we might be able to stop this is\nThe if this is this is a prosecution of a crime\nRight in our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person\nThey need to be held responsible however we don't need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamics going on just because this is a media feed on today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously and look at the facts only a media ... because it involved a reporter\nAnd yeah and and and the story is so dramatic as you point out what was it wasn't the first Hitchcock movie yeah rather window right we're window I mean ... you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you wonder if capturing our attention which is ... is okay it's just that we have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Saudi Arabia look bad my guess is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things um this ... I mean getting remember this prince took his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely eh stole tons of their wealth\nIncluding planes and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking the remains out in suitcases\nSo these are the planes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in a you know rich Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia the very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we didn't with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure\nTo not go through an intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously\nBecause if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and Tom to everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you talk to the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're knocked friends of ours\nAre not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nWe don't need it open up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nWill watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb\nNo radio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W.

election\nTime and we have some uh twenty twenty um you know elections suggestions I'm just I'm just 'cause I'm a helper I'm a helper stew you're a helper and we just want to help the Democratic socialist out\nUh we've got some extra spending maybe that they could consider some slogans necessarily think extra spending as possible or what their support them as being a barrier to do that I don't think they've taken every dime true yeah I mean\nDifficult to find more to spend arrived at ways to spend ... million remember the classic documentary is from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance humid received the full inherent as the three hundred um this is an important moment or in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take an ... so he couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had a zero after it's at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing we do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from then on was the idea in in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually and it's just a spoiler alert from Nineteen eighty three but how did he a wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at All right uh so I think ah you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is\nTen they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a\nA democratic socialist [laughter] and do you have to spend sixty trillion dollars\nTo do it is harder than you think it is harder than giving can you do it\n... the socialist already have but can you do it\nVery difficult very difficult when you go over that I think we're going back dot com slash tours yet to go by the way to get to grab your\nTickets a Bill O'Reilly is coming up in just a few minutes and we have a lot to ah to talk to him about um I I\nI don't know if you've seen this but uh Minnesota's democratic former ah or sorry farmer labor party ah this ah this this weekend to this last weekend said Republicans should be brought to the guillotine\nOn November So that's a that's okay that's that's a that's not as bad a thing you want a targeted districts to take her right right yeah yeah the guillotine is I mean you know that's common language people always say that I bring a good team we get ... but those you know whoever into a gear team\nNow I assume mhm I hate to say this but I assume they're not actually building a team just about Republicans and I'm not sure I'm not a hundred I'm not sure it anymore I I think I Do think that the ... you know could be talked into it pretty quick all we act\nAs if I probably could be a Roger Williams the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that and and it's maybe not so a positive on this new\nDemocratic um a way of thinking where they're saying ... or Eric Holder when Republicans go low we kick them\nI'm Cory Booker says get up in the face of Congress people Maxine Waters a harassed members of the Trump Administration Hillary Clinton we cannot be civil all these things are ... are maybe a little bit more impactful to someone who was being shot at by a Bernie Sanders volunteer on a baseball field and then watching the skull east almost\nBe killed but what's worse but what's worth those things the guillotine or horse face seriously what's worse wow that's a great I mean one of those things deserves\nTwenty four seven cover it all I Know which one it is I Know what it says on Twitter right it's a yeah it's horse race and certainly I got to be a serious issue and we all know that you know saying or space\n[noise] [noise] you know saying\nIt I I mean I mean the question is what's horse horse face or the Rwandan genocide I'm On the fence on that part of it I'm not sure there are so close right and deserved an equal amount of coverage by the way cars face will get more coverage than there was a genocide ever yes yes it already has had already had already had a day\nAnd funny or I Believe horse

I Know I Know\nThe bigger picture here is this the Democratic party is confused now they don't know what to do All right I'm Juanita Broderick claimed that Bill Clinton tried to rape\nDepression never in a million years is going to give that allegation any exposure at all non stop going to happen so you can talk about it I can talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nArgue why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at\nLeast acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality is that is putting herself out there in these\nPositions where she is the re litigate this stuff now the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president\n[laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo you know I Know she wants to run and do you really think she will\nIt depends\nA lot on Biden it depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against her is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is the Democratic party doesn't know what to do\nWith Bill and Hillary Clinton they don't know what to do with them\nAll right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on the road and they were in and talk to their devoted supporters this isn't an accident [noise]\nThis is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was frozen and we did all this and Hillary was a great a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary's day that's what this is it ... it up\nThe country to see how it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field\nAs it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that\nA non American ... know rushed her a horrible\nCrime rushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we got a little bit ah blood on average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves give us a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total Rosen fraud knock it off the chair\nIndians themselves crazy\nOK and war and you use that ruse as I say in my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the wrong use to advance their current and academia\nSo and this is a woman who thinks she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts that may be at Oregon you know these states that she can get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate in a way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist a do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three that she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um uh she was a chair or as a mother or you know was a source of all of this but look I'm\nGetting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed\nOh yeah All right so she didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because\nShe has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe ... she lets them\nYeah she's a system a Paul would they call in New York She's a Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes or so I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what\nThey may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than ... is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg is going to run for president of the Democratic ticket\nYou know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg are very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but\nHe doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there but other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think in twenty twenty but I think the only twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly\nShe would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's the it's the reverse you know\nThey're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPer year to the you know I'm not sure you need the uh the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter any more\nJobs to smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this was in her time the next time around you want to go up against Trump I'm certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about ... ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't forget his new book is out killing the ss which\nIs fantastic uh pick it up and grab my book at the same time by him as a as that again I think that's what Amazon his recommending people who bought this brought this to a so grab 'em 'cause they're both really good All right Mm liberty safe\nSo now he had a guy will or the mayor the town Rosa police bureau that's what they call it there are basically says I'm not going to force the law not going to do it and that poor woman uh is going to be a salted verbally and\nNot allowed to walk where she wants and that's okay with me mayor Ted Wheeler that's fine and I'm going to tell my officers don't help that women don't interfere there\nAnd also I'm going to lead antifa a surround the ice headquarters\nAnd I'm going to let them do pretty much whatever they want to do including fighting on the street using masks over their faces carrying weapons they can do whatever they want to do now\nIs this America you would think the people Portland, Oregon would rise up white that they would go out in the rose city which signs condemning the mayor and antifa and mass tens of thousands of them\nThey gather by the ... river with their signs this is not the city we want you got anybody out there doing that\nNobody so this is the problem the problem is that wheeler the problem is that in ... the problem is the people in Portland, Oregon\nAnd that's why I wrote killing ye says\n'cause I'm saying we better wake up here in America we better wake up and confront evil and ... is evil\nSo I get my boss yeah I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that\nThere isn't a an uprising or in Portland or they are the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's the real readership\nAnd they ended in Montgomery County so you if I were still working on channel two I'd be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out uh on the banks of the ... river\nI'm going to be there at the turn in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility it'll it'll be two\nUm unfortunately because there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAlright they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the New Orleans but yeah I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe they're not like me and maybe people hit me or I'm not going to do it it's\nA selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want dogs on the streets and mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten the grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians ... the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means a but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThings have gotten even more bizarre and now now now they're saying that the ... he was alive\nAnd aware as they were dismembered seeing him a it is just an amazing story I'd love to hear your take on it and also if you were the president or advising the president\nWhat would you do when we come back [noise]\nKnow radio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W. L. A. C. dot com [noise]\nThe the tendencies to our report morning five ... ... talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than double the ... the\nYou're not willing to climb down combat\nBill the frustration is growing in America the press is excusing or antifa they are excusing everything the Democrats are saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said\nIt's time to bring the gear teams out for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets\nYou um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\nWell you do it peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper or with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example or a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing because that's almost ...\nPossible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what\nKilling the s._s. was really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want\nTo engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and arts\nElements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them they sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes\nAnd there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo ... that's the big difference we didn't have that what was left wing press but we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's what we have now\nMe let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say as a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king um the rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten a for doing it by ... but in the Nineteen sixties\nThe press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out which\nIs what happened is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nDoing that would have to hire security they'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it\nJust takes it takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively\nTrying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still try to do with Trump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad\nOkay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran in the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you why not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nAnd then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequence of that is that the whole alliance against Iran falls apart at a wine is empowered eight times as much as they are now\nThey'll do it and it's free right now you can order through October thirtieth and you'll save up to forty percent plus an additional five percent off site why would the promo code back\nInto blinds dot com forty percent plus an

R. subscriptions are up and our our uh you know visits to the website ... you know back over a million or you know a day which is fantastic\nUh and we're just we're thrilled thank you thank you thank you thank you for watching and listening to our podcast thank you for finding the blaze news on apple news uh we're making a big impact now an apple news which is really fantastic uh so we thank you for\nFor sticking with us and\nUh just stick around because we have some really good things are coming your way and a an announcement while I was supposed to make it this week and it keeps getting delayed and\nSo it may it may have to be next week so I'm not going to be here tomorrow or the next\nAh Glen is purchased the Cleveland Browns as well as the running that franchise from now on so\nAll you're excited for that ah yeah Cleveland yeah you know to know anything about sports but no no I'm not even sure if that's baseball or football but could be basketball you're a big issue with them was you wanted to change their brown costumes yeah I don't like the ... yeah and that's and that's one of the things I think that's you know why they're you know\nThat either really good a really bad I'm not sure right and then they have to do but they have to have this costumes changed because they're not that second\nYou're a bit of a ... to ... well but I'm also very into Ohio sports you know the uh the the cabs cab I thought that was a really stupid a name because I mean why a baby cow\nI mean Who's Afraid of a baby cow that's not that they're not fast like they they have ... they can't\nHave you considered but maybe it's the muscles on the on the back of your leg\nNot that you never thought of it that way yeah so that would be better but what a stew I mean what is your what is your you know jump there's a lot of jumping in basketball I Know about what will you know what's the mascot look like or the\nBack of a leg I said I was going with or at least I don't know that other regularly or say yeah that would be really kinda weird how do you feel about the Indians are you offended by you know\nI Love the Indians I Love the Indian ... I think actually we should start a team of some sort and we should come up with a Native American name ourselves really yeah\nYeah I'm a you know people seem to be going the other way that they're all yeah\nAnd I do think it's about time that we go the other way [laughter] I think it's about ... I kinda had enough\nOf it so I you know\nYou have a if you have a name\nA for something you know that we need to start a baseball team or you know something you know and just inside the blaze with [noise]\nThese people were executed because they were leaving the caliphate these were people who had been a wet endure more than likely the full three years of the ice occupation and muzzle and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of I\nIt's you know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so leaving behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so yeah\nSo you went from that um to say and I I've got to do I got to keep doing this\n... um and that brought you to Burma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talked you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update\nForth yes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as arraigned fund\nFor getting out of the ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a bunch of people yes and you were going to bring them all\nTogether slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist because all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing\nUm [noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips with the ... find in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to how this because\nI was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then to the brim are removed all of those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these tribes [noise]\nIt's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma\nThey want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve departments and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because where there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought ths\nAbroad with me several photos have somebody I'm over his mercy pass their apologize I think okay so I brought with me [noise] several photos of of what I see all the time when I go to these places\n[noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened um this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you handy photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see\nDead civilians you see kids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage these or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and the baby didn't die right away I Survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and the army still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time\nThe ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artists for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the arm army him and his family have fled the Burma Army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the ... fund was there and he came and found me and he said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive to this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's they have picked fat and rice and ... and ... and so we're sitting there\nAnd he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark it's bark from a tree and he's like this is all we have a snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and he has nothing is literally nothing and she wanted to give me ...\nBecause that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark but this man and I was I was so overcome was just like I\n... his gratitude is the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the ... being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle\nAnother man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he's driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh like oh good English uh what I'm trying to pick them and talk more about um [noise]\nUm I'm about what what use more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what would you know you have any like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nThat's what he says to me this kid who's maybe Nineteen years old they\nKnow nothing but a slaughter an Oscar in these in these terrible things but\nWe're there to bring help and we're there to bring help and it it's an honor to be there was an honor to represent the ... it's an honor to do what I Do every time we go out we save people's lives and it's it's it's an incredible thing and we keep things like those photos that you're looking at you can't even show them\nWe keep that they're actually happening foreign on\nIt\nLee means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why yeah man anybody talk and all that why is it now [noise]\nNo radio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W. L. A. C. dot com [noise]\n[noise] ... this is talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W well ac [noise]\nNew program so glad that you are here um we're going on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond and Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City\nUh Tulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour or we're going to see if you can spend as\nMuch as a democratic socialist a game show that I don't think you can win now you know I think we all lose in the end and and you know\nThe sad part of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or you know as his parents wanted him to be known\nIs going by as he used to call themselves going right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself that's all right so Beto\nIs running here in Texas and if you don't have and you haven't seen that you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics ... outside of that Ellen and cold there ... you can hurry where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd go and I would have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change but\nWell they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have it and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points to visit from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with Beto tonight CNN at their poll sending to forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as Eighteen I made that would\nBe a real surprise uh no it would be but you know that when I mean it is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran but I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won he won by three but I I just think that there is this something that\nAh you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I ... I tend to\nThink he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here and lack of this\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll is\nIt the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is\nThe um ... you think of it bright red country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nThis way try this on for size\nAh a Donald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life\nUm and Donald Trump has a really good side and a free leap pad inside and it depends on what day you're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh can we talk about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or a big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job okay mhm I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Nashville", "day": "17"}
