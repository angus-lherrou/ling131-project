issue which our job and are you at all though\nIf we don't know\nThat's pretty good new ad for a for Marsha Blackburn the Republicans nationalizing the election talking about jobs\nAgain that the jobs not mob steam works particularly you see this mob of migrants heading north particularly when you see the the kind of mob violence on display at the Marsha Blackburn rally yesterday again go to

last in line\nAnd so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap of land vase say was there as because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as foretold\n\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and style and couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud\nOf who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nHad a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of\nAll faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that Mad Men went into Philadelphia to try to stop this is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again the group of people\nWho now have to concentrate just on one thing\nSurvive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease anti Semitism is as\nOld as the world\nFrom the moment God said\nI Will make you might people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI've told you you are the audience that will in the in ... the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence the world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\nThis is not who we want to be\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\nThe cycle of hate\nHas to be gone again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time and the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos\nIt always comes in a time of fear it always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society it's why\nOur founders came here in the first place\nWhy our founders defended the Jews\n\n\nWe're a different country where a different people we're\n\nNot better than the rest of the world we just see things differently\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nHe stuck in the middle between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or blaming them\nYou know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed\nThey're out here in Boston there at their out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children safe while in a prison system called school\nThat is teaching ... and and doing everything that most parents believe\nThey come home they're tired they don't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed society's just pouring into their house with with the media and social media\nAnd then they have to sit and they have to watch people screaming at each other on TV\nAnd there's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering a solution none of these things anybody is talking about is the solution\nIs just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed they're the ones\nThat are racist they're the ones that are massage ... they're the ones\nExcuse me we're just outta here bussed in our rafts trying to make a living well you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our tax dollars [noise]\nBut the the what's happening in our society is a symptom\nWe are unfortunately sick\nGlenn back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen ten double the ... the\nSean Hannity weekday afternoon to you on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W LA scene [noise]\nWe welcome to the program Mr a path gray a hello pat how are you hello\nGlenn come good that was a good how's your weekend a it was a it was not great and why why why not\nIt was a you know a bad football games uh experiences everywhere I went\nTo a rodeo experience everywhere you you're not having a hard time talking out than speaking\nTrue you know that would cause the easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had a really I really had a difficult time I mean I just\nDid you guys watching the news all this week you know as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews or CNN heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you\nDon't want to lose I don't know who's doing that they do I really don't know who's your fans watch Fox\nYou know 'cause uh it's a safe haven mostly English watches Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but that's always been that way but I don't know\nI'm just CNN I don't know who does 'cause that's his son watch\nAll the people who hate Trump ... yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on it sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly out\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do down a synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of hers\nBut he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was winning ... state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise] this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\n... ... what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today change and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter or outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah with a lot like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall are just courses pretty terrible at the moment\nBut again has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it's us there ... telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever the guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out\nAnd he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the republic ... was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that\nAnd neither did I say and either do today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they they had a very balanced view of that one\nFor a understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes we can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb thing saying thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie\nSanders situation but both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is it is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings\nAnd I'm going to do with it and you do not you ... discourse does not commit murder\nDoesn't happen so the reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nBeen feeling for a very very long time and for someone in your position to actually said out loud and don't you dare apologize for that\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nAnd in fact repeat it ah it consistently just repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was\nYou know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah thank you thank\nYou so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday you\nKnow we're going to be out of town not going to be out of town really upset me free tickets but seriously oh now all of sudden you're in it can change that I get your change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what\nIt is it's Sunday a ... I think it Sunday yes it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ...\nIt's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about like a a stuff you were given gift from the gods as far as serial yeah what does the the ... turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nAs it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and\nAnd comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the proceeds from the I'm from the event\nAnd um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee I'm Down here a group I'm not sure we are going to give 'em to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish\nUm center perhaps the the synagogue and I'm not sure an odd sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted here's an example\nOf course that supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews now I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard\nA that was a bicycle national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was\nJust presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it that's all okay that's not a big one that I got a big one so\nIt's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros that you are an anti Semite it's completely insane if you are a ... a conservative\nAnd the people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George Soros but they criticize him because he's a liberal or progressive policies he supports\nA policy that we disagree with that we're criticizing him around him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world that but\nAnti Semite hate George Soros too we in some ways there are things in common there however they don't\nLike him because he's a Jew or the way they don't like fish Shapiro because you're in front of me Shapiro party the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish\nI don't like him not because he was and you know but because\nHe came up with the idea of communism I\nI'm not a man no not a fan of fat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives they're anti Semite\nWell I mean that's not something The Simpsons signed on for yeah sorry\nTwice and I\nBelieve all race and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please say Megan Kelly I think the same type of thing right you can't you can't\nMatter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these in these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be pleased no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter ... they're not asking you to remove up who they are not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them any earlier you realize that the better\n[noise]\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough\nWhen America will enough be enough new polls Americans fed up crave unity amid\nViolence now this one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party\nThey want unity that number is even higher\nBut I'm not sure people actually mean this I'm not sure what unity even means they say that we no longer really uh agree on the core values\nOf our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values but what are those core values\nAnybody know what are the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now\nWay things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied\nThirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is what\nAre those values sincerely\nAre we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys uh shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple I those aren't values\nThose are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we have a few things we have to decide\nWe have to decide one so western world worth saving\nIs freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want you just you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case that their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are\nAccurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are week we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice is in it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions what are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them\nHave you heard anyone actually make the case for America and not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it\nMan let's just move on I I'm I\nWe cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth\nOkay that's a value that's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\n\nThat's that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nNow that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up that's a violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is ... this is collusion\nEnd that yours yours system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system and it doesn't work\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it\nDon't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about litter\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only\nActions do don't tell me what you believe show me what you believe\nReally the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to\nGo to relieve factor dot com\nNashville traffic in less than ten minutes on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and dean can tell you I like the [noise]\n... [noise]\nBad country or a good country that's that's the question we have to ask about [noise] it is the\nWestern way of life we're saving is it good is it nothing but a bunch of ... gender males white males white Europeans that of oppressed people\nIs that is that all is that all it is\nCan I ask you do when do you think World War two officially started when did it really start start so not our involvement in it [noise] yeah not our involvement\nUh gosh I mean the date I'm not going to get right into it is give me an event [noise]\nIt's a tough one\nOr would you say Germany invades Poland or you know breaks the treaty with you know I mean I'm sure you do to judge Chamberlain or ... I mean ... so you're talking events that lead into other events send me that you could go in for a million different places that\nI'll give you I'll give you one how about when Japan invaded China happened in thirty seven if you live on that side of the earth yeah you think World War two started then Japan\nInvaded China Manchuria they said the only problem was Manchuria is all the ... that sounds familiar a and so they invaded and they started up mass slaughter\nMass slaughter all of the you know the bad bombings of civilians that happened years before we were doing it or the Germans were doing it it had it started in thirty seven in China with the Japanese\nWell where was the white man now you know where the white man was you know how history reflects this now\nAmerica didn't say anything at the time America didn't step up to the plate and\nStop the slaughter\nIn China so wait a minute hold it just a second so are we supposed to get involved in everything or are we not supposed to be involved and everything when we get involved do you blame us for getting involved in saying we're trying to jam our stuff down everybody's throat\nWhen we don't show up you you blame us for not showing up either way according to you we violated quote our values what our values well\nOur values used to be we our enemy of no one friend all now that gets a little\nDicey gets really dicey didn't get dicey apparently when\nThe Japanese invaded China yeah that's because they only care about Europe no actually no we couldn't fight\nOn all of the friends we had to choose we didn't even want to go save Europe American didn't even want to go into war well could you\nOh my gosh how could you ditch your oh wait a minute\nWe're supposed to go save the white patriarchy where we're ... wait a minute we are to blame for all of that because we didn't go in and save the white hierarchy I thought you just said that was bad and should be destroyed [noise]\nIs America's bad or good let's have that discussion I'm\nGoing back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten double the ... the\nLimbaugh weekdays at eleven on TALK radio na da point three and a Fifteen ten ...\n... ...\nAddress the before we when we get off the air today there's so much to talk about um we've got to talk about\nTwitter and what they're doing now 'cause it it brings it brings the point that I was just making\nHome about what our values\nAnd what are the problems that we're trying to solve their different people are now saying that you know the problem is is that Americans don't agree on basic values and principles anymore\nWell I agree with that but nobody even is talking about those when's the last time you heard anyone really talking about values or principles in the mainstream media\nTell me last time you heard that talked about on Fox or on CNN or MSNBC\nTell me defending basic principles what are those principles well American principles we used to find self evident that all men are created equal\nSo you want to talk about the uh the the shooting\nIn I'm In uh\nPittsburgh great that guy has violated American principles all men are created equal an endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights one of those rights is religious\nTheir right to to pursue God the way they pursue God now\nHow about the principal violated or by the bomber\nCrazy guy crazy guy wow\nAll men are created equal in and out by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these\nFreedom of speech freedom of expression freedom of assembly freedom to petition your\nGovernment well I don't like what those Democrats are saying I don't like what the media is saying but they have a right to say it\nSo do you target them for death not if you want to talk about principles everything else\nIs about politics now we could talk about his mental health and that would be something else that would be a very valid target the topic we gotta talk\nAbout mental mental health in America Americans are feeling more and more alone more and more isolated communication is going through the roof\nBut none of those are principles\n\nDo we take care of one another well that's the golden rule isn't it\nThat's the golden rule\nSee we we just assume that\nAnd we were awake for a while and I don't I'm not sure if we are as wake as we think we are\nNow we woke up and we we really um we really learned\nA I think under Barack Obama but now many of us have gone back to sleep because okay our aside is in charge and so they don't\nTake care of it no no they won't that is the problem no they won't we are the answer they are not the answer we are the answer\nAnd you're not going to learn this through osmosis\nFound an incredible thing happened to me my my son finally

morning in Atlanta addressed to CNN\nForce them to go early to get all the activists out and they could have them go and you know go pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're I mean there there are ... are doing on that particular day but there's one interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that if people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand and six team\nSo two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats so what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now are we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of to to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen\nBut a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now there were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama\nAnd then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one so in two thousand twelve with rock Obama they had about a six point advantage for Democrats ...\n... in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change so that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ... time\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for Obama then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Obama\nWith Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for over ... been changed to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had a five point advantage for Obama in those states and the Trump election there is about to point advantage for Trump right now those states are showing a twelve point advantage for Democrats show that the part of that it's it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're\nBroken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time we're this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania's can example of that where they have been just a big lead or not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some ... like soldiers how to tell me what all this means from last\nWeek or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just they're just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is [noise]\nThere was an I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now wait ... seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all of due to the shooting in the bombing [noise]\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you want real polling reaction that we leave till today so you have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the earlier case I Will look for that [noise]\nThe election by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend or as you know a gunman opened fire at the a tree of life synagogue and Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured six others former police officers the guy was insane\nHated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat doesn't mean that he was\nYou know following I don't know Cory Booker whoever it just means this is not political\nAnd shouldn't be I Would keep\nJumping to politics first\n\nI Can't imagine what these families are going through\nPennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish\n\nHow to deal with killers\n\n[noise] have you been listening to me [noise] um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing but I don't think there's any way to deny that what I've\nWorn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nAnd they've taken gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down um I don't know if they're back up as Afghans fault gab as it is kind of a shorter\nCompetitor I guess I Would say that they found up are\nBecoming a safe haven for anti Semite so I guess and and and you know I don't want that\nNobody wants that but we either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nI also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't silent voices\n\nSky was a deeply disturbed really bad guy\n\nYou know you watch TV and you see the victims the faces curling across the TV screens\n\nAnd you might think that things are getting worse\nAnd I guess historically speaking this is the worst anti Semitic shooting we've ever had in the history of our country eleven people\n[noise]\nOn the positive side that's nothing compared to some countries\n\nI saw some reporters say you know the problem is is a this is Donald Trump I Hope you I Hope you're happy that you have your uh your synagogue\nOr I'm Sorry your ah your embassy in Jerusalem really really that's where you're going\nReally this was caused by moving the embassy to Jerusalem oh my gosh\n[noise] wow\n\nYeah Jews were killed in Israel like terrorists last year a hundred and twenty two hundred and twenty two is that Donald Trump's fall too or is that just the evil dues fall how many France\n\nFrance they're moving out at a record number because they know they've seen this movie before\n\nSo tired of the west to being the blame for

the middle of the night\nWe've never done that we've never done that stop it you know who he is China\nOne million Muslims are now in a concentration camp in China rounded up why because they're Muslim that's it\nWears everybody on that one\nIs that because there is no white man evolved is that what it is\n\nWhere is everybody on that one\n\nAmerican so bad luck and all the hatred in the racism slavery\nYou know slavery still going on in Africa\nSlavery is going on in the middle east\n\nSlavery is happening in China happening in Brazil it's happening in in Haiti it's happening in Mexico\nWhere are you on that one\nSo tired of playing this game\nWhen it comes to the Jewish people\n\nI obviously don't speak for everybody but I I Do speak for my audience on this one\nYou're not

TV we hear angry voice when you're struggling a bit more than ... than usual okay [laughter]\nMy my my advice is make a tangible because there's so many of us that can't every day and and listening to this broadcast but then we don't make a tangible and even you were saying that you have an doing your shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think that's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people\nYes I agree my friend and I generally and I had a a friend of mine that says Vietnam veterans in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at two AM\nJoe six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday well and and then stood for eleven hours straight because we were told the first two thousand people in line to get into the hangar\nAnd we knew we were going to get that way and and as the guy that you carry on looking at Georgetown can't wait to sit down and you get to the hangar there were no states so there's the reality of we're going to be standing another six hours\nOn concrete so when we're saying is this president is a lawyer [laughter] I'm Sorry I just play just playing the second go ahead tell us or I could\nSay it as much as they want you know what we we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale as solidarity network which was a socialist group that was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake breakfast before they came to protest\nYou know we ... we were joking well do you think there were a vegan including free option is to go along with that and right but\nThere were ten thousand people there for the rally and less than Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of how would you say this about your pet function as when you've had the restoring functions\nThere was no garbage we would never know when I was ten thousand people there you know one was complaining I was I actually had to warm up to Trump myself and I tend to get to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down now people are so open about talking and\nSomeone had to go to the bathroom ... their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child well well you you run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment\nAnd you know it's like a president just happened to show it was I and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois\nBecause I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this is after we got in the hangar layman standing there are two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all know we had jokes of you know conservatives the one thing that liberals can do better than us as chant we can't can't as many classes or something\nI Know we saw it and I'm really glad we saw [laughter]\nLet you know it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just killing us by the time that they got there and George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our road trip that we took for this experience\nAnd as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang George looks at me and says he's doing one in Missouri later this week as they how\nFar is that well that was that what it was just six hours and they're even going to be eight but we're we're going to go until we found out that this one is going to happen right across the river on\nFriday so fight like it tangible and that's the best I can say is go and meet these other people tend to Seventy five\n... ... were very quiet people but we just got to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can be there's hope for society\nYeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot and you're like well yup on how\nAlison hang on the second I I Want to get your copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it out to you thank you so much for holding and thanks for I'm I'm sharing that it is that that is but maybe if I might struggling today\nDo feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated at ... in the nation I Would say yeah and I am able I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what she's saying here um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nOr being an anti Semite she's his daughter is Jewish\nBut I you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few yeah how many how many Nazis were like oh you know what yeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry this Jewish guy she's going to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen again", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Nashville", "day":
