L. A. C. if you want to join us on the phone lines are we talk just briefly earlier about this Georgetown professor Christine fair\nWho tweet it over the weekend that entitled white men would we be classified as ... I suppose so I think any any white male is now press fight isn't titled in in this country I I just think that's it's the war on men that we're seeing play out anyway this uh Georgetown professor\nUp she teaches security studies we wonder why the dark State Department of justice the CIA the FBI or having so many problems with their political agenda taking priority over their duties and responsibilities and their oaths of office\nA she's a security studies teacher at Georgetown the trains people who didn't go into our\nDark state national security\nIntelligence communities um she treated on the weekend look at the U.S I I she's not apparently very good at that typing I think she met this chorus of entitled white men justify a serial rapist irrigated entitlement a yep\nShe's reached the conclusion that Kevin ... with no ... no evidence and and know supporting information is a is a serial rapists and this woman is is the one that's training people to look at data looking at information look at raw intelligence reports\nAnd provide security assessment so so basically just decide what you want the answer to be and then just make it up whether you have any proof or not that's what's being trained to go into our intelligence agencies at Georgetown University she made the video of Republican Senator Lindsey Graham defending Kavanaugh\nFrom allegations of sexual assault and then went on to said\nQuote all of them deserve miserable death while feminist laugh as they take their last gasp bonus we cast write their corpses and feed them to swine yes that\nThis is a and Georgetown University issued a statement saying it's it's within her right of free speech if a male professor assuming there was ever a conservative male professor at Georgetown or any other university if a male professor said something similar about but just Dr Ford lazy\nUm maybe called her a skating rink\nYou mean with Kevin jak like having Jackson and lawyers job at Fox no he he said it over Twitter are we going to take a professor could make some comment about the lazy Ford's\nBackground her history or some of these other accusers do you think that if a male said something like Senator Geraldo did women should just shut up and sit down you don't you think they keep their job at George said mentioned just shut up right but if it was Mitt if a man that women should just shut up and\nSaid I don't think that laboratory law but at the time but now I missed that what was your last name\nFair fair unfair for Dr ... doctor on Dr\nUnfair from Jordan she talks like Dr Palese for it in that twelve year old girl voice by the way that the her story continues to fall apart a ritual Mitchell that who was the a sex crime prosecutor who questioned\nHer set a five page memo to the Senate Judiciary committee and really just destroyed her case destroyed her allegations in the in that\nManner looked at the White House controls the NSA apparatus\nThey listen in to every one of our phone will surely they have an audiotape of how Christine Blasey Ford actually sounds when she's not trying to sound like a twelve year old girl I'm sure that when she talks in her classes when she presented these\nPsychologist seminars around the country I'm sure she sounds like an adult why don't we have an audiotape or a video of what this woman sounds like when she's not pretending to be a child\nHere's here's my or take away you know last night President Trump referred to senator Blumenthal you know the one who said he was a Vietnam vet\nBut wasn't oh he and his in his troop drawdown fire Hillary Clinton when she went into resident lives near somewhere\nPresident Trump called them done hang Blumenthal I thought that was funny well the name Blumenthal had is demanding that the FBI investigate or interview twenty more people in this this FBI investigation the seventh investigation of a judge Kavanaugh I you know who is not on that list\nChristine Blasey Ford's two brothers who are living at home who are by the way lawyers who were living at the home of the time the alleged incident took place in her and her parents they're not on that list\nAnd Christine Blasey Ford still hiding her therapist notes\nAs well they gave me the Washington Post but not to the FBI but she told the Senate Judiciary committee she didn't give them the Washington Post Washington Post that she did what's that word that legal word to that when you tell us ally to under oath\nI think it's actually it's it's it sounds better in Latin but it's actually liar liar pants on fire but it sounds better than one other quick story and\nI I was accused one time on the show of being being harsh and seeing things black and white and it was a good thing I'm not God because because I see things in black and white it's like to have you read the Bible I mean God not squishy God doesn't see some gray area between right and wrong and good and bad\nUh so I Do see things in pretty stark terms and pretty direct terms and and I am so sick of the everybody gets a trophy attitude\nWe have this story from St Louis Missouri the mother of a Missouri team is suing her son's school in federal court claiming her son was the target of age and sex discrimination\nHe was rejected from both the ... junior varsity soccer teams\nAt la du ... high school if you're a junior and don't make the boys varsity team you can't go down and play with the freshmen and sophomores and think you're a a really good soccer player 'cause you're playing with kids who were years younger than you\nThe school says this last freshmen and sophomores the chance to develop their skills\nSo in later years they're prepared to trap for the ... the the mothers of the la du junior says he didn't make the ... and she doesn't think it's fair it's not fair\nYou know everybody's a school and those who this is you know this kid if he's not a complete snowflake and mama's boy which he probably is is mortified that mommy is suing to force him onto the team\nAnd not just to the bar see this they're saying you should have made diversity but but she ought to be able to play on the junior varsity because of the coach said he he's he's a good kid and and has some good skills which is now saying we didn't want to kick him while he was down we were trying to focus on the positive courage our kids to keep working\nIt was to build up his self esteem and not punch him when he's down they need to punch him when he's down they need to go out and say this kid may be the worst soccer player in the history of soccer players and and make it clear why he's not on the team I came up in the day when they would put your name on the door of who made it and who didn't when\nYou would see the cut list in black and white maybe that's why we're a little tougher than the snowflakes that are coming up who's mommy's are suing because they as a junior in high school can't make the freshman junior varsity to

police were called the police said hey knock it off go home for me what kind of Mad Men what kind of Jack the ripper are we putting on the Supreme Court thank you New York's New York times\nThis story does not live up to the even the editorial standards of the New York times someone through ice in Nineteen eighty five really God Forbid you ever go to Philadelphia\nNow Emily the writer of this story her tweets make it obvious that she's opinionated against Brett Kavanaugh so now the New York times has been talk of publishing a supposed journalists being an activist and this is not him at stake out of the story gets really editorial staff\nWell easy I Believe they're probably activists as well their activists and this just goes to show his temperament\nCall\n... ... you know somebody might come in and say hey I'm fighting for abortion in the court and\nHe might just take a glass of ice and and throw it at that person\nIt used to it America we have a full week of this as we get closer to the vote the ridiculous this escalates to a full on clown show ... probably by this afternoon\nNow a clown show in the media leading up to a circus in the Senate\n[laughter] you know what I guess nothing's changed but this time can I at least get some cotton candy\n[laughter] [noise] ... October ... gland that program [noise] All right\nSo [noise]\nTo [noise]\nA little disturbed but [noise] I I Know I Know\nAh the ah the goalposts man they just they just keep moving I'm [laughter] I mean they must be tired do you think\nIt's ... there were there heavy the goalposts are getting heavier and having having your because there's a lot of the farther you move from the harder it is to justify a if this is incredible\nUm uh though I Am very disturbed course by these new allegations against Brett Brett Kavanaugh that he ... through frozen water at someone frozen water first of all or can it can be heavy um\nYou know what it means people are like oh it's not a big deal somebody through ice frozen water can be dangerous tell that to the people of Peru were twenty two thousand people were killed in an avalanche in Nineteen Seventy to those people family\nSee this is why he's not on the Supreme Court look at look at his temperament you don't have the temperament to be\nAnywhere near that microphone Mr ... I Do have the uh the temperament to be on the ... the a team however though you know ... I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that\nThey spent Glen ... teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how he look it's it's certainly on its own visit their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWell what it what it does say when it does say is that it plays into a larger picture up this man\nHe was in his anger when he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing anything\nSo if anyone reached further I Know if he would've come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to meet my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger I Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with ... yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful unless\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here is my ... to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and going this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turn out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in like a she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying do you watch what's going to come out and this FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening what\nIs happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that it by the end of the week that's what they'll be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way you have\nTo have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say you know he he you know\nQuit or if I went down all went down in ... ran down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is\nThat press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely\nBecause you don't need how long did they do take the due to the ... sessions\nAh ah ah I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated\nAnd then ah February eighty was the ... went down so let it for weeks at three or four weeks for an hour it'd probably could have fast read other things going on\nGay so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks the one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nAlready been done he's only under get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another Senator Mike Lee is the guy and Michael he's the only senator on the list\nShe s so so you've got you've got Mike ... you could select him let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't\nChange accident but it could happen I mean it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy who they were fighting on the\n... yeah I mean was turning around if that happens to Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering a the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes him into sausage ...\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life uh and he would vote for\nHim in the bottom line if he cares about the constitution anything I mean you will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee\nBut it is helping to keep that traffic flow trash working at Harding

put this on for Thursday I'd like to hear from me Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... a ... just about the book\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after ... did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week now and if you've read it\nOr let's talk about it on because there's all there's a ton a ton in there\nI I think it explained so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they found completely insane about this cap it off yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no way\nAnd that he committed any sort of crime and that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the entire effort of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things this doesn't make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but not real\nThe real basis of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example maybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you\nHow the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way a\nAnd the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nThey're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy and to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blow their job why they did is they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted to outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading and try to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do um and ah and then joined us on a joined us on Thursday\n[noise] okay [noise] um we've we've dealt with

background check on Kevin ... which again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist Oh thank you up at the area important it's so important\nImportant if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up on because there's just certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the cabinet case in the aisles the case of the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay\nAll right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort of between ... and ... we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that I got both of those so little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay actually does what did she\n... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah ... they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the the Ford case with something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now or never named Kevin ...\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might know it's a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you\nThey'll usually leading me yeah and she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not\nBeing fortunate to have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening then people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down\nUm including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures and those are things that she showed two co workers\nIn real tired real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually eat advice you Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that time yeah\nBut but but lives and I mean you\nI mean you don't have video tape tape now we haven't seen it yet though huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the ... and\nWe don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I think we have them out more and I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case there however", "year":
