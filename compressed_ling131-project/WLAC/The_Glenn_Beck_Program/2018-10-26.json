eat what's points over South Carolina Kentucky uh over Missouri I with the points are are taking I'm taking the ...\nAnd Georgia Florida Georgia a a six and a half point favorite you're taking Florida um that's where we are so far what else to get\nWell one final game of a local nature Vanderbilt plays Arkansas and Arkansas and Vanderbilt one and a half ... favorite this these are very two very very poor football teams to in six Arkansas three and five and her ... um I wouldn't touch this game was ten foot pole other than the fact that it does\nSeem that I've looked real old veteran an injury problems the fences beat up a well Jay this dark and so it was over the last four straight games Vanderbilt one files as it gets too in in in the last twelve games against the spread what we're playing southeastern coverage team so this will be a game if you just had to do it in the mud or\nI don't drink a lot of it I don't know I I'm not even hold on record saying anything of that game is I don't think maybe neither one of\nThe [laughter] just a slight preference not an official pick out your guy\nEnded up zeroes ... nobody cares nobody's going anywhere ...\nGot a schedule that thinks the bad I mean these guys have got to play a lot of football here\nHave left a Missouri at Missouri then they have quote unquote Mississippi in Tennessee and oh well when they play just you know that's like a whole day for Tennessee So nonetheless Vanderbilt might be to Arkansas Oregon so I'll be there but I'm not judge you\nYou're saying it's an interesting game to watch\nWell if you're a fan of gold fan you're pulling for the black and gold and [noise] to me you know if you're at Arkansas\nAnd since you can't talk about Penn State this week no I've never met a nephew\nI Will never Mitch that seem ever again in the history of my prognostications never do that again\nI gave that a change like when all the processor three consecutive waste any you know he was over three in\nThe titans go to England and and go for it I I don't really have an objection to uh to to go in for the do they they felt like they had the momentum I have an objection with the play they called but but they went for it and they they came up just short\nEverybody every radio station has a history of America's Talk about this football game so I don't know that I could lend anything\nAre false\nBut also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time\nIt's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse\nTo say anything about it the crazy thing is today\nThe craziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt forget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake\nNews yeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in Chapel Hill he was ...\nThe government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nBecause the media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake for New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is what you know just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta\nAnd while this is happening in New York Times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter five novelists imagine Trump's next chapter the\nMain image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelist had one assignment right out what you think happens after the motor investigation is completed okay [laughter]\nSo let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen immediately after\nAnd he'll mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come as a surprise and they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not\nGuilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me\nKnow that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool this is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable how is it the two hundred\nJournalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American\nMedia is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\nThis this time space exhibit a\nFor why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America all of you dancing on the grave of Megan Kelly really what was her what was her big thin she asked a question that\nOh my gosh lock her in a tower\nOh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public so you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nFinding is gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will\nChase you out of the public square they have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\nYes there's a little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people\nI have gone to them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these errors oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and the New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia\nIs a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radical you don't you feel that they were being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBut here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[noise] [laughter]\n... over twenty second run back program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point in the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the one thing that if you're conservative Trump make the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey it's fake news hey these guys are lying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that the same as violence like you're\nWell they never gave us really any details on ... ... ... well you probably didn't get to a paragraph thirty four ah\nThat's what I Love the you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left to right Mm okay\nI was in New York Times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read the bottom up a lot of good stuff towards the end when you get to the bottom you start with the bottom it is funny because usually the headline doesn't\nMatter uh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake explosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonated almost like a Wylie coyote kind of\nBomb almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the ... feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension ah but I'm very in real life\nI'm ... in fact the fact they go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock their devices really keep\nFrom tipping off their target and know about when the bombs are said to explain it was just like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I thought oh look at it and you're like that's not a bomb here's a here's a bonus if you survive\nIt got an handler wants one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually want to kill you want to do that if they\nPull you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong Italy horror despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time you'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out and instead\nYou know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend on doing they don't intend on a you know you saw what happened to for example Dana lash right like have to take all those things seriously when she was on TV uh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threat that come into public figures often and ... and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look a terrorist I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would\nUh execute a terrorist attack on on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I noted states it is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens\nHowever obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether there are in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending me things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a big media circus you think they're all plausible possibilities we have no room and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the race dog fire and um I don't know about you but\nI think the Germans behaved admirably I think the Germans did exactly how to do with you on that one no but it's\nThe rice dog then communist did that bright crime [noise]\nNo radio at the office no problem you can stream I show alive at W. L. A. C. dot com [noise]\nDave Ramsey weekday afternoon from five ... on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W. I. Lacey when\n[noise] when\nThey land back land Bill O'Reilly Georgia's that about half an hour from now\nPat gray from pat gray at least heard every day uh just prior to this program on the blaze radio and television network a and you can sign up for his pod cast a really great podcasts lots of laughs and lots of insight pat gray unleash wherever you get your\nPodcasts pat should we talk a little bit about Megan Kelly\nYes in the heinous horrific crime she committed I'm surprised ... still walking around in this society sincerely has she been imprisoned yet I don't think so she needs to be she dangerous\nWell she has you know she is violated something that NBC feels passionate about to\nDo well he started to they didn't feel that passionately about it when Jimmy Fallon dressed up in blackface as Chris Rock wait what yeah he dressed up in imitated Chris Rock and yeah but I'm from what network though I'm a little over there\nThat was on NBC always end and the NBC that end up saying that we're not even anywhere really worked for ... dress up and blackmail no no it it might be okay for Halloween if you are not making fun of someone right so\nShe wasn't making fun\nOf well he was he was kind of making fun of Chris Hughes imitating ...\nA ... you know it's even more ... than that though and it's it's ... it's despicable that we have to play this game and it it's okay for all of them\nAre the Jimmy Kimmel thing with good oh ha imitating Carl Malone do we have that audio yet Sarah my gosh I Am not one has agreed oh we have a rather listen to this is Jimmy Kimmel in blackface [noise]\nSometime in my home alone look sky and say what the hell's going on out there for them on other planets\nPhoning home like anti while home loan rate on TV about why people getting ... and all kind of hell up and\nHome alone ever seen a flying saucer hisself folk festival Rio spoke at times\nAlmost say several a stop to\nHang out that's just give me ... it's unbelievable unbelievable which aren't you about you imagine even even talking that way no without blackface just talking that way it would be our last\nDay will be gone you know I talked to a of a couple of different examples of blackface are being used in comedy fairly recently like in those Sunday in Philadelphia was one of the examples he brought up\nBut it's an insult was sending in Philadelphia they did it and they did it as for a minute they're making a point right like that only be more on ... characters on this show would think that that's an appropriate thing mhm\nThis gimme came of it is just saying hey I'm black and I'm Carl Malone is just him mocking a black person\nYeah a mind the way he ... and the only thing that speak the only thing that's funny about that is the way he speaks yeah yeah that's it mhm I mean play that again telling me the joke in here other than the way he's speaking what was it the Ebonics\nIsn't that what they call and then the person that's the only other I think he's doing right now listen to this\nI mean the joke to them and I home alone look up and sky of hair on going on up there for land on other planets\nPhoning home like in the\nHome loan rate on TV about why people getting out the violence and all kind of hello Sam\nMean they're not a single joke 'cause they'll give you an honest using returning as Karl Malone always did no not always but often did referring to himself in third person and it's a random topic of the only other part of that basic yeah and he's in blackface right like better so unbelievable forget [laughter]\nThat's the end the Jimmy Fallon one more cars Jimmy Fallon is not a political enemies and Kimmel has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him\nBut Fallon who is I think there is no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that bit he's friends with Chris Rock writing but the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah you can spirit us ally early for mentioning it but you're ... you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but place in your network so what she said was\nWeight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana Ross she liked Diana Ross you on a limb like Diana Ross for the night and she's not making fun of he's not making fun of Diana Ross\nWell isn't that what Fallon did actually didn't ask the question teach in the ... yeah\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday and I thought about this as we're getting close to we're getting close to Halloween ... ...\nFor asking a question now you may not or you may not have agreed with this question because I can see how corrosive how dangerous how awful that question really was but God help you when you ask\nA question that your overlords who may I just point out\nAds the FAA the far far far left that many of you are starting to go I don't know I'm starting to be afraid of my own side when

Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose the fight back\nTrumped it and he said I'm not going to let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter\nThey see me as a person who strikes back when attacks so while I'm going to do that\nSo then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this and you can make a case said Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow it how did he have his own people names yeah\nHe's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them ... feeling beaten and kit to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came\nLater when it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and it I I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down\nFrom the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post\nCNN MSNBC\nAnd Leno Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump counter\nWhat does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very ...\nAnd sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice what\nIf he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that\nBut he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it been is because he gives them no quarter yes he fights back\nBut now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's outta control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where they were not responsible for any of it or not us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh [noise]\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened that\nFrom the jump of course they're cartoon bombs they are\nThe only thing it it doesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight straight this word but that was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press and needs to all of the all of the enemies of the right obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence with midterms I'm putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do we how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank withheld political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out or the or Washington DC think tanks progression fish tanks they ... and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this um may be the person sending it was insane ah you know that kinda thing\nThey'll never say well gee maybe um our side is so craves now

they're dismissing it and that's just a crazy conspiracies the thing to get all the Trump supporters all wound up\nThere all dismissing this now um I I Can't believe that the they're going to make it by the mid term election I think this is the to the to arrive\nAfter the mid term election a and a possible new Democratic House which will throw us into chaos hey\nYou think there's any the reality in their ... be what do you see coming in and how things are going to shake out\n[noise] was Bill O'Reilly dot com I now who says that the Mexican government will break up\nA lot of the uh the caravan before\nThey start getting on to vehicles 'cause they're not going to walk to Macau in Texas or\nTo wanna um San Diego sector I they're not gonna do it so they're at a they're approaching a or a railway term is now in Mexico some of them will get on trains heading north Austrians have to stop and Mexico City and that's where I Believe the Mexican government start to intervene\nUm some of them will make it I'm\n... now and they're not going to walk so you don't think it'll be a mass\nNada break 'em up that's what you know look the state department palm pay I was down there now army needs screaming at them now that\nYou know if you let these people en masse go to the border we're gonna take economic reprisals on Mexico and that's what they'll do and they know it so they'll break it up\nBut some people will reach and some people would get they're mostly in vehicles are much where the smugglers command the cartels come in a ... a ... to hit us already has vehicles down there um you can do trains you can do a whole bunch of stuff but\nWhen it gets to that point the um border authorities will put up barriers new barriers and there'll be manned by us troops and there'll be no way for the migrants to get to any us official to apply for asylum drums already said he's going to do that he has to do it\nOn the left is hoping for some kind of violent confrontation that's what they would like to see\n'em but I agree with you that this is not helping the Democratic party I'm In the vote ten days from now how bad it's hurting them it depends what section of the country or rent\nIt do you uh um do you see the the\nPossibility that real radicals\nWould like to set up a a Palestinian uh Israel situation at our border and it would be handled exactly the same way by the media as they handle the Palestinians and Israel they\nThey show the big bad state beating up on the on the little guy do you know I mean I I said two years ago this is what our border is eventually going to look like they're going to set up a\nA palace in standing in kind of situation and we're going to be Israel I mean they've already done this you know on the small stage bring it you know bring it to Broadway bring\nIt to the American border and that's the way they'll play it\nMay be but there's all the ... the Mexican government does all want that or they don't they they don't want that got problems on a border um ... you know war is one of the worst places in the world Tijuana right behind\nThey don't want all this because it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster for Mexico these people only facilities that they are the water they need food\nMexican people are poor\nThere's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah so how do they love shanty\nTowns there with a mother's in babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and let them in short but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how do you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nYep thank you very much Bill O'Reilly men selling books are killing and he has that really really good New York times best seller of course\n... we'll talk to you again next week take ...\n...

I was a little skeptical but now that I Know you've got to do I'll get a rush to get it done to pay you got to write about gay no that's not it but\nUh amazing story I'll share it with you coming up in a just a second\nI'm also if you want to know not what you should be outraged about but what the left is outraged about it's actually kind of funny and we're starting our outrage of the week give away are we likely to set up a sign up for our newsletter we're going to send you a the the biggest outrageous from the left of the week the crazy things that are really putting them off\nOr is this really it's it's it's kind of enjoyable it really is a Glenn Beck dot com slash outrage are you a river\nHe was treated um he was a treated or in the wounded man and needed to carry one of the soldiers off to another Humvee to be medivac out one of the soldiers had his arm severed just below the elbow when he was in shock\nHe handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that the wasn't able to walk the man and looked at his own sever an army and his hand and repeatedly told\nThe medic that that helped him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm sometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lied to myself and my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us\nAnd I broke down in tears finally able to process what in the fall when my now seven year old daughter\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks it wasn't until months after\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing only wanted to do after she told me about this was find is that this guy and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten months\n\nI had been teaching this boy in Sunday school\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh how I hated and wanted to hate this young man\nI wanted to ruined his life before it even began\n\nI wanted to let you know\nThat in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nWho's the last couple of chapters and I heard you speak\nThat I I realize that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me I needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all\nMen I forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and my anger lifted\nYes the pain of what happens still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by might hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it\nLiterally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep that I thought there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least\nOne guy Christian\n\n\nChristian is a um\n[noise]\nAs a man who has gone through a similar situation recently with one of my children\n\nAnd I thank God we caught it before\nAnything happened I understand I understand\n\nWe knew the address of the man who [noise] um did this to my son\n\nAnd I think if it would have happened and I wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\nI think about it all the time to think about my children\nAll the time and\n\n\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me or I haven't talked to my wife about it\n\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\n\nHow we're responsible I had been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\n\nThere are things that we don't want to think about that are truly frightening\nAnd I think\nWhen we look at our country\nWhen we look and we really realize\n\nWhat we really stand to lose it's not our job it's not our money it's the unsinkable\n\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you said if somebody if you said to everybody you met in the next two weeks you know you look like you could use some cheering up I think you'd be right about eighty or Ninety percent of the time\n\nAcross all income levels across all colors and boundaries\n\nWe're all struggling with something\nAnd we all have something big to forgive that man we don't want to\nYeah I mean I\nIf if if that's true what the van ... will do and should be noted [noise] of course he's absolutely not my guy [laughter]\nYou know I Know is that if it was but there were going to say some guy either yeah but you know they're going to assign him as you know this is what a Trump supporter is like and blah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so\nA terrifying it's not going to be a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nYou're gonna be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh and that's what's\nFrightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs on the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports them but they certainly say well that's not\nThat's not the you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you why is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from Bernie that that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAnd as we said at the time a Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting ... baseball field endures Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note um but you know again this is we we're not gonna know enough about this this is but this is a product\nOf the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating this [noise]\nUm and you know it's not going to stop until both sides realize it until the media says okay wait a minute\nWhat do we do what did we do that makes you think that we're the enemy what do we do and actually\nListen to half the country\nThen we can move forward and to create a better tomorrow ...\nTalk radio di da bomb through ... and Fifteen ten W ...\n[noise] ... this is talk radio in Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W ELL easy\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter] plant that kind of looks like we may have the guy who was the sending the package bombs [noise] we know now he lives in\nFlorida has a criminal history has ties to New York they have wrapped his a white van up so you can't see anything because he looks like a crazy mad as one of those\nYou know it's one of those vans where their stickers over every bit of it um we're not sure it looks like he was a Donald Trump or a big\nBig big big big big big big big big big big big\nCrazy big fan of Donald Trump emphasis on crazy [laughter] ah you know but we we don't know for sure because it it looks like that's what those stickers are but we don't have a clearer picture\nOf it yet yeah I'm get get get on Internet I mean we had on on you see how long we have to wait until this is two thousand Eighteen I Want it immediately I Want to know that one guy in an hour ago I Want this guy in jail by now I Want to know and speaking of that by the way I mean isn't the bigger problem here don't\nWe just stopped selling vans\nBy an ... fan stop telling white vans and arrest all people who own white fans have you're driving around in the white van right now we'll give you a good no\nNo no we not Europe to no good if you're driving a white van right now we know you're up to no good what is your mail\nBut what what what was it was there ... or is it about which one was where were you know at home sleeping last night can you verify that we have witnesses do you have do you have a discount the fact that makes it ... it looked like an ice cream truck she can learn a little\nKitten there is that what I said I bet you're doing okay what\nElse would you do with a white van and twenty Eighteen well in the business uses and know that they wouldn't be this show no they bring up all sorts of things if I mean if they have their own show they can make that point I suppose wasn't the\nGuy wasn't the guy in Virginia [laughter] was it so if you disagree with is get your own show uh the guy in Virginia didn't he have a van to I thought he is living in his van or something wasn't even\nYeah it's I think you're right yes he was because he went to um he he would be that the YMCA the local YMCA so when the shooting happened they knew where he was and they knew who he was because\nHe was very he he was lifted in another state and drove there should basically camped out there and prepare for the shooting right\nHe was he was a Bernie Sanders guy a big big big big big big big big crazy big Bernie Sanders guy and he was living in his man\nI mean it's going to be interesting to see I think there's several distinctions to several additional levels so that's why I say we find out that this is exactly what is it is the person it is his band these are pro Trump stickers whatever I mean we don't know any of those things for sure yet uh but if we find that out to\nBe an interesting distinction to see if he is the ... he either a very incompetent lunatic who\nTried to blow up people and failed or hold on I Want more than ... ... or he's a a lunatic who ah was just tried to\nScare people did not intend to kill people that will be an ... a distinction that will be interesting in the investigation did you see this man I did okay I'm going to guess incompetent\n[laughter] get get sick of it too because of an like that you know if you're thinking I'm going to put a sticker on my ... my bag because I Want people to know and maybe it'll change their heart maybe it'll change their mind yet that man's not\nThat bad it's not that that ban is like a ... stay away from this guy\n... let me ask you this guy yeah in in American history looking for\nIn global history in global has has there ever been an individual who has been won over by a massive collection of bumper stickers on a car has anyone ever changed in opinion are considered a new one because someone not from one bumper sticker 'cause I think that's even possible\nBut maybe even a couple of maybe not due to write three you're pushing it you have\nThree hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know people because of it\nOh no if you have an H away you're you're you're going to be kicked out yeah you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors\nEven the name you could be living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood with the holy family and the pope and all of the pro life activist from all the time right\nAnd you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards yeah you're nuts\nI just really hope if Jesus comes back yeah he's not in the van [laughter]\nYou know when it comes in a white van with the budget bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just like I don't believe this guy there's no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming right or maybe that's how he does how does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes with that I Would I Do [laughter] well no no no", "year":
