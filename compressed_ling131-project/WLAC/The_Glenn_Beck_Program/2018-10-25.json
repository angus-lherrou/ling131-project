Joe you're on the Steve ... show with Michael Patrick Leahy the tendency Starr Report welcome in\nYour mornings David darn good to hear your voice on the radio again\nMy friend's thank you spread the word let people know that we are back you know the I think the first day we started somebody calls it almost had tears in my eyes when I tuned in and heard your voice again I I said liberals across middle Tennessee had the same exact reaction [laughter]\nThat's right that's right um I Am not in law enforcement but I find it strange that the FBI would allow them to take a photograph post a picture of this\nWhile there's an investigation going on the high whatever I mean it's all contrived in my mind\nIf you're trying to attract somebody down you don't want to put a lot of the evidence out there that are\n... that would not again if if this is a hoax though you put it out because you want to distract attention you want to give to the audio plenty of pictures to deal with but like like you said if you're the FBI and law enforcement I Can't imagine they would have been saying send us out although on the other hand\nPeople didn't know what to look for I mean if we get a package delivered to what to the radio studio and and it's got big bold letters with the return address to\nA Nancy ... or to Wasserman ... Debbie Wasserman Schultz with Florida misspelled what's her name misspelled or didn't didn't maybe we'd be on the lookout if we see a similar packaging again maybe that that it's more of the hoax we want people to find this so that we can create a hysteria and give the\nThe media the pictures they need to to let this completely occupy the attention rather than the you know fourteen thousand Hondurans marching through Mexico towards our border\nDo do you think that they find the person quickly\nIf IRS my theory if they find that this person\nIf they don't find this person a Monday it's absolutely a hoax I think I think that up and I I Can't take credit for it but I heard somebody else to say that it's probably an an safe a member who was trying to sign up for one over on you know to make Republicans look bad\nWell then again putting the or get her done Larry the cable guy sticker on it and we get there they did everything they could to make it look right wing and uh I I don't think a conservative\nActual right wing or what would have been doing the hey it's us kind of what they did everything but do return address to the White House you know signed by President Trump Joe thanks for your call Seventy seven nine five to seven three seven W.

these devices were\nNot designed to kill\nBut to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny again there is no chance these bombs would go off\nSo maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other this however is not stopping\nThe left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business and Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the less narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nOver or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media who're just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first\nFirst of all that would force one to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back\nSo deep in your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or

the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen\nHe barely remember was I walking at the time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote\nFor those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on anything everything is speculation\nAnd if I Would say Ari ... versus ... wife Dwayne person trying to Iran for everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening and they'd say\nOh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens\nIt's almost unthinkable you can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason\nHow ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever\nSeen it sort of when I when we first looked at it I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder\nAnd um I I was looking at it and I was like no not really\nI mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeat the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel was what's dangerous and apply bought the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't\nNeed [laughter] [laughter] right [noise]\nUm but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or\nSomebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want\nIt to work\nRight it had no I mean you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time in some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to\nThe coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels physician\nBecause he had spent about ... or she by the way he or she had a sense um some of these bombs to home offices\nAnd and residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely\nBe grilled can I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and her fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from a\nGet the paper and the mail every day when she gets up\nWhose home

I Love this [laughter]\nAh [noise] the the headline on CNN Trump a Trump I'm a mocks media as explosives investigated well wait ... you guys were blaming Trump mocking Trump yesterday\nBefore all of the bombs were even found you were blaming it on him\nWithout CNN is there it's really irresponsible he was gone over the edge they worked a target of this and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization ... he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of the continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there are words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that that is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't know like everything that he says about the media but\nWe have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fit into these bombings we have no idea we have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there is a\nPolitical motive but that's only earlier political motive but that's all you could say you don't know\nIt is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope God I'm Glad none of them went off by the way\nUm but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we've just talked about\nA no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's that ... like that because the postal service is not an exact science\nYou can't pay off into point to our right at that time on\nTiming to you could have blown up the postman yeah it's so that there was a photo timer it when it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny is the wires are going into that more with the way of dealing\nGlenn Beck on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen than double the ... the\n[noise] Dave Ramsey weekday afternoon from five ... on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ... lazy\nGlenda and I'm just looking up on my a leftist anarchists cookbook a that was put out a by the left\nAnd the Nineteen sixties and seventies about pipe bombs and you know it's really interesting is um uh it does show how to make one you know with a clock a but it also shows how to make them\nYou know so they go off like let's say you open an envelope ... you would pull a string in that era in that area which would make the bomb go off [noise] I'm I'm trying to figure out welcome to the program pat gray from pat gray unleashed\nUm I'm trying to figure out\nWhat was the timer timing to\nEither this is the worst bomber of all time in human history or there's something else going on here\nBecause you would you put a a sticker on a bomb like I ... I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess in theoretically possible but if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and sugar ... and less and less again\nPotentially a you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing meat yeah right like\nAlmost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nThey all look but they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you want metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't put glass in the bomb would just disintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't\nWant it in PVC pipe you wanted a metal pipe because of the shrapnel this is just\nIt's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be some\nYou know mentally deficient\nA right winger that did it\nIt also may be somebody who was on the left is like oh I Know how to change the narrative\nCould be that too if quaint don't know I mean you have to have some level of skepticism of the of the of the\nOf the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you lead to that is it's not the haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing ... figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think it's someone who is opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and considered that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figuring look like they're under attack is special\nWhen it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWide someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievable so much just to listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you see these statements that have come out from\nCNN and ... you know people just outwardly blaming the rights and Donald Trump for this look I don't we first of all you can't blame\nDonald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George Soros is how well no but I think of ... [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions\nWe know that but beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by the hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America you will that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs to go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical eye\nA bad grade from ... unleashed a pre seeds to this program on the blaze radio network and then also you can get him on line wherever you find your podcast had gray and least it is worth to download moron Harvey as Mara\nOh what's that what was the match up a Green Bay and whoever they are playing I forget that every week now because you're just going to be very big liberals have you on Monday Mornings bring the recap the best of moron tribute to this program\nI Will ah yeah we'll look into that yeah oh my gosh look into that and do we want to work to do all the work unless you reap\nThe benefits yeah yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nFor a trivia is tomorrow with pat gray and least thanks pat a alright [noise] my patriots supply [noise]\nWould like to ask you this question [noise] do you have jumper\nCables no of course yeah why do you have jumper cables I'm such a\nConspiracy theorist you're such a worry wart viewer such a small sometimes you're free you might leave your light on or really your battery dies a car can start a okay All right so you got to be a proper and out of your job ... prepping much is being smart\nOh this is this is honestly this is the argument\nPeople ... you feel weird 'cause you're preparing\n... you know for something that could or couldn't happen I Can't remember the last time I had a jump my engine but I've had to help others jumped there's\nIt's just a good idea to be able to have jumper cables isn't it just being prepared this is why you buy emergency food when a crisis strikes you're ready to feed yourself and your family or help out others\nMight patriots supply food storage that I have and you should have as well like two weeks food cat\nWill get you started out two weeks that's breakfast lunch and dinner for two solid weeks you'll save sixty two bucks when you go to the website prepare with Glenn dot com do it now save a busload of money two weeks of food\nThey last up to twenty five years in storage fly Kevin jumper cables everybody should have the eight hundred two hundred and Seventy one sixty three eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or prepare with Glenn dot com [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ...\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now not until\nRelief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking it was nice long walks or\nPlaying golf for tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know\nThe majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to go to release factor dot com\nYou to get from Mallory lane to Madison Time saver traffic follows Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three pants fifteenth Dan W.

wagon train\nOkay is she was she looks like me in a dress with a bomb it\nShe\nShe'll she also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\n[laughter] you know she did she wiped her face\nAnd ... and kept going she didn't wine gene cry about it she's like oh\nCrap [noise] shouldn't around with that\nI poked my eye out and she moved on\n\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happened we move on that yes\nPeople say things that I don't like we move on that yes\nThings have changed we're involving we're learning new things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\n\nMegan Kelly ought to know blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what if it's a costume that his\nPurpose flea ridden a ridiculing race\nAs black face has done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly\n... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong\nIf I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong that that person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\n\nI think that deserves an answer instead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me\nHow are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river\nShe floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that\nWill know that she was innocent this is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that\nOrwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sort of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the\nTell a screen swap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter\nAnd here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind the world we want to end up in unfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is exactly the world we're creating [noise]\n[noise]\nAll right I Want to talk to you a little bit of other sponsored it's one eight hundred flowers dot com one eight hundred flowers dot com\nMounted on her flowers dot com or the reminds you that you know the holidays are coming up anniversary bouquets or the special uh but you know some of the sometimes it doesn't take a birthday sometimes just want to send flowers and its most meaningful when it's for no reason other than I'm just thinking about you and I love you\nSending a blue ... K from one eight hundred flowers dot com will bring a bright smile to somebody's face one eight hundred flowers dot com and get your ... where it needs to go for great price one eight hundred flowers has an exclusive twenty four four twenty four offer right now\n...\nAmazing as it is that is that's such a question that you should be drummed out of all society right\nThat that's what's amazing about this first of all we should point out that there's a lot of people in and side of NBC\nThat wanted her out for other reasons like ... ... oh yeah yeah do you suppose is now I can tell you this has nothing to do if she could have said that easily and been applauded\nHad she not come from Fox had she'd come from CNN or she was on the left or whatever that that crowd would have plotted her saying that and I think they are there's a lot of people that would be the that didn't appreciate her coming out against NBC personalities\nOn the sexual assault stuff ... as well but just just talking specifically about let's forget all that exist and talk about that but actual conversation her point is what is important when you're trying to decipher someone doing something that is racist for example is the motivation\nRight the motivation is what is important the words themselves can be bad or good but the motivation is what is important let's go further than black face for a second\nThe N. word right the N. word\nWhen said by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock says it\nNot so bad why because we know Chris Rock motivation is not because he's this terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in this been sorry for the city of Charlottesville who now if they're named is if it on to this with racism but I mean we don't we are talking about here\nThe the if you have an All right figure you have Richard Spencer you have some hardcore racist saying the N word it means something different and the motivation is different and that is important\nLike it but I Will say this ... it is still I\nI don't care who says the N word I think it's a disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody but you don't get drunk out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism and another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia\nIs a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history fourteen season is going to sign up for the fourteenth the ...\nAt least once and I think twice they've done entire episodes where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up what after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the animation but still the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he he's that they're not trying to be racist or not starting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that\nThey're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good but the child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd they don't want to die in the mix right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we may\nSay as a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we are not adults if we can handle that level of conversation Mm\nLand back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen than double the ... the\n... the tendencies to our report morning five to late on TALK radio

I was fourteen thousand these are the top fourteen thousand people in in the United in the world\nAre they are they're the best people the top fourteen thousand from one to fourteen thousand in the entire world they're marching up there and I'm Out of the ... just to show\nA how how much they they love America and they just want to participate I Want to share in in in freedom and the American gathering I Do think I could get\nFourteen thousand people to march across the United states mhm okay march across the United states for\nYou know any reason [laughter] no\nI don't think I was fourteen thousand people in the United states capable of of the ... yeah I don't think so okay you're talking about uh you know Seventy five or Seventy five hundred to fourteen thousand people marching what's left twenty six hundred miles mhm okay\nSo that's not just something that everybody is like you do that\n\nNow what's really going on is this is all politically motivated and not politically motivated here in the United states this has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans this has everything to do with the politics\n\nBetween Honduras Venezuela Cuba and the United states [noise]\nWe've been outlining this now for the last few days and nobody seems to really want to pick up on it\nBut we'll continue to tell the story because that's what's really happening now

came in and then he was going to change the constitution exactly the way Hugo Chavez has changed the constitution and made it into a a a dictatorship so the Supreme Court\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him\nSaid that's not what we do\nWe don't want to be a

funny enough to be a standup comedian as we as a side has basically stand up comedy show a Michael Moore and Trump plan which cannot twenty sixteen right during the weeks before the election is hoping sway the election to Hillary\nWhen you when you say when it when you say like we saw um I don't think your guest you should be careful with the use of the week 'cause I don't think I don't think I

years that they've got worse and worse sick of did okay but\nTwelve years ago as movie about a health insurance and what she claimed as a Cuban healthcare system was better than us asking this was a it is sort of insane rats are no longer that rare you can find them everywhere and basically I I think they use audience that used to go to movies I'm never\nOn Columbine and get a lot of young people in their twenties are really excited about that movie uh they've forgotten about it maybe they moved on to turn came along to their Daily Show and all these other alternative forms of comedy and\nUh you know Michael Moore is that is you're not really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd as a okay so so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything to be said for uh\nThe fact that ah this this kind of stuff uh you\nKnow you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore it's\nJust it's not you know he was revolutionary and we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there's no scarcity value to what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of a sad moment at the end of star nine eleven nine where he does this Hitler montage and try and say Trump is like Hitler and it's like if you're into playing the speech that Trump and Hillary and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler on the left for about three years\nIs like is the last one to the Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of ... where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talk about what are Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that pause and they're not just\nTalking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where we look at Canada and say that to socialize nation that was not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left\nPointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism I mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know we're socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an\nEnd to capitalism and they're still getting elected read\nMichael Moore has been a been a leader of that parade for a while but now he's kind of ... in ... it's ... it's kind of gotten a hands on he closed his movie um capitalism a love story with the communist uh at them you see the Soviet national handsome and and that kind of thing is just not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does it say does this say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time\nWas seemed like Gehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff\nThey should stay away from a abolish ice I should stay away from Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls and as a Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding now which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it is this strong\nA and it's only because I think of the Democrats moving so far left I agree ... thank you so much Kyle Smith a critic at large for National Review\nSo [laughter]\nI'm listening to President Trump got another one of these ah\nAh you know rallies and he's talking\nAnd I'm\n... and and I'm I'm hearing the reporter this morning talk about it and how out of touch he is and I thought to myself you know\nOne of us is deeply deeply mistaken\nBecause he was saying you know this is this is this election is about Cabot all this election is about the caravan this election is about um uh shutting people up this election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just ... dog whistles set for if if you think that the caravan is not something you should worry about what's wrong with you if you're not worried about the economy and the effects of the budget and tax cuts um\nWhat's wrong with you you just don't see it or are you\nIs your philosophy sill upside down from traditional American or economics and philosophies that we are now on the other side of the fence promote move from one another and I\nI think when it comes to the politicians that's what it is they are on the other side of the fence and they just don't think this way anymore\nNow Donald Trump has said if we lose the house God Forbid the house and the Senate but if we lose the house is going to be a different world and I think he's right\nGold line has just put

and Fifteen ten W LA you seen\nI have a migrant caravan\nIs coming our way to migrate caravan\nThat's not what this is that if anything this is a humanitarian crisis because these people are being used they're being used by political operatives in Honduras Mike Lee a senator who was always standing guard by our constitution welcome to the program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much good\nSo you um [noise] uh you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand that ah you said there is a ... there is a procedure that you're pushing for\nTo hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that a Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department of state suggesting that they work out an agreement with Mexico\nWhereby a Mexico would require people to enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from\nOr any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from with the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states would be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada\nAnd a rule imposed by the EU for refugees are arriving in ... countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing a a a a country that it's dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial such that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum and the first country they reach that could be potentially safe here that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads\nDo not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy and apply for asylum I I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works\nAnd that ... ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico that are sort of going for the long bomb ill Mary pass and tried to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous journeys itself I'm ripe with opportunities for people to be exploited\nA ... it's an exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of whom are sexually assaulted\nDuring the ... and a lot of the people claiming asylum\nTurn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once\nThey're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application if they're coming by land from Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I don't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a a lot of potential magnet agree for bringing people here\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain if you nailed it quite a few minutes ago in saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey\nAnd then knowing that when they get here the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event\nIt just creates a whole lot of headaches for them\nIn the process so Mike I got a I got an uh an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras\nSaid been following the news or on the caravan here locally uh been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this
