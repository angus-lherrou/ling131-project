them with\nThat's certainly one of the ideas behind scenic individuals themselves can better there are a lot but together the\nHad the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nOf very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... she doesn't six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nFor relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all\nOf the reasons they're favored in ... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races so the split is going to be important here but\nJust that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have in ...\nThe nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh sing or has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate paths to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that look like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leading Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the capital thing\nNow I mean I think it's a real a real it's really going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten we're at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in part a sense because partisans engage more like generally um that's like of course a blanket robust typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until ... when I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump\nWas at a four percent yup or to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nSane right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever write her life like was that being said\nUh you know I vote Republican I mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I'd go for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and we were\n... could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand channels like forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one\nThis year so this is a whatever the reason while it was higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIs it I mean the only thing I can think of is\nThe Guatemalan refugees\nWhat else does happen I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that some after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine performance you\nKnow it is their whole lives that this is going to be interesting it is like it's like\nYou know back in the nineties the opening of Star Wars yeah this is now what people care about and they care about it and almost like a cultural entertainment sort of way be which is I think fascinating\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rate shield another way we can save your money on your mortgage\nCalls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nIt's in writing where he said in comparison to deter records racial upheaval only Val I'm thirty three year project ... information I conditions equal housing lender licensing office he said animal after thirty thirty additional conditions are losing ...\n... this is talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W.

[noise] have you noticed anybody who says\nAnything other than ah shockey oh the great one ... oh ...\nWith the exception of uh uh hear his name forty seven different ways in that sentence now have not heard [laughter]\nSo it's it's amazing to me how if you speak out you're a conspiracy theorist now hold on just a second sense when his reporting\nOf fact since winning is quoting him hey conspiracy\nAnd make it seems like the accusation is if you're trying to say that he's ever done anything that's questionable in his life you're making excuses for his murder which of course it's not\nThat it's not no no it's different that's different that's that's the people who are tweeting and saying uh oh so you deserve to die no no no no this is a horrible crime committed by a horrible state who is not our ally\nPerhaps we need them I don't know I don't like to getting into the situations I Wish we weren't there at all\nBut this was a crime and it was despicable disgusting brutal I mean unbelievable to people in the west but it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it okay\nThat has no bearing on who he was\nWe can say that this was this big ... horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z\nAnd we can say ... did not deserve to die this way nobody deserves to die that that way however he's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs the Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic\nState he wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post says yeah we have to have a in Islam assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islam is this rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule\nSharia law tell me where it's working out show to me\nIs that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean\nHe Islamic rule just by a nother group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia\nNo thank you I Want to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy there was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it\nAnd we have found that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue\nBut let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving friends because\nDoctor radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ... see\nTalk a little bit about [noise]\nThis back and forth with Saudi Arabia because it is important that we get this right and we don't make this about American\nPolitics we should make this about American interests but not American politics right now people are saying I kept away Donald Trump or\nYou know what George Bush Bill Clinton the second\nGeorge Bush all the way back all the way back to FDR we have been in bed\nWith the Saudis I don't like this I think we're in bed with really bad people\nHe's a rattlesnake a bad pet that was asked me once and I love this is a rattlesnake is it a bad bet\nThe answer is no so perfectly fine pet as long as you always remember it as a rattlesnake or a snake and not a little puppy dog\nIt's a rattlesnake ... not a bad bet just don't get it and don't\nTry to a fashion or at least ... around it's neck take it for a walk it ain't gonna do it\nSo how do we handle Saudi Arabia well should be the same way we handled turkey but we're not because we're looking at turkey and Saudi Arabia with American eyes stop it\nThese are both Islamic states now their warring with each other why\nBecause one is Muslim Brotherhood and one is a well hobbyist they don't like each other they want death\nFor everybody in the other state they want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia what's thirty stopped\nBecause there will hobbyist\nWe're being put in the middle of a fight between to Islam assist both of them want the caliphate both of them want Islamic rule both of them want to rule uh with jihad and they also want to rule with surreal law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those so now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place horrible horrible horrible horrible place they execute kids\nLong as you've shown any kind of signs of puberty you're tried as an adult they execute through beheading ... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court\nJustice Kavanaugh yet uh by the Saudi were woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each\nGot you know between two and nine years in prison however she she received six months in prison and two hundred lashing ... with a whip\nBecause she was in the car without a without her husband and then she dared to take her story to the media is the kind of people that we are dealing with\nThe crown prince you and I are not going to like this guy\nYou didn't say oh look at what he's still he's he's making it easier for women to drive without their husband yeah okay yeah sure sure sure\nHe's still a lobbyist\nLet's look at what both\nSides in this country have done [noise] we're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that\nPresident Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year\nIt was President Obama that vetoed a bill that allowed families of nine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government so both sides everybody is in protecting these guys\nWhen the crown prince came here to America he met with Donald Trump\nOh my gosh\nBut he also met with Oprah Winfrey bill and Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer\nBlamed the rock Johnson for some unknown reason Brock Obama John Kerry ... rice George W. Bush Henry Kissinger Michael Bloomberg Thomas Friedman from the New York times\nA smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign to say that he was a member\nOf the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote this man wrote that he it was a mistake to think\nThat you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam assists\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam and Islam is just believes you\nHave to use sharia law that the constant wow it sounds like the mother Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood\nTurkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states true\nThey kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him\nProbably Saudi Arabia did he deserve it no does he deserved to be called a freedom

you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next\nIs what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California than hunter hunting arena where does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly battered because there is no second or third chest move from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's

you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... or a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and are there is no anti ... hair and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans\nAny given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that men are basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content\nBut it was shared content ... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work\nOr if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that\nWe had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now and they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still\nReally only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like and to her do who are doing this to hope\nFor viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignore them [noise]\nSo what he is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... or ... soon them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe in law go day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity that way\nBigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness\nAlmost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless\nWe can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local
