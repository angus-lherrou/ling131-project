I think my wife my wife last that long this I really started to shake apart you think my wife is like sticking around\nI got to say I love tiny I cannot believe she's still around I mean I've known her for a long time I can't believe she's still in town ... this is something that she could have taken a plane she got a jet at any time with half of the money you go to St artsy go to saint kits you you just that's the way there I don't know\nI got all the adrenaline [noise]\nShe didn't tell me that was one of the condition she said you take one drink and I walk I take the kids I take the money I Walk and I believe her oh I Believe or do I think she should walk whether you have a drink or not and you know what she really didn't win in many ways in many ways\nI mean the whole the whole I used to love cigars going going hanging out with bend the other day and they were all smoking cigars oh I'd love\nTo have a good cigar and the last time I smoked one I was smoking and Tanya looked at me it was ... first started dating and she said\nI just can't imagine myself smoking I I Can't imagine myself kissing somebody who had smoked a cigar and I looked at that cigar and then I looked at her they looked at the scar and looked at her like\nIt's the guards it by my love and that was it and the\nCuban economy sales for the final\n[noise] I mean how you feel and go ahead drink I mean not not ... how are you feeling mentally drink and answer the question I'm a doctor\nJust so you know this is all being done under scientific I mean I even have to coat although I Am a little upset that I don't have Dr Beck and broader right here I Know to have that you should get that I Am a doctor\nYou are a doctor thank you um [noise] I uh either way universities\nI only have one doctorate I Am looking for a second we should pile amount for you I feel like we should get I'll take it for many I'll take it from a college in Mexico I don't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr at least said I have no knowledge of it the only thing that existed was the accusation that right there is the story of the past three hundred and sixty five days\nI don't know what happened to professor Ford I have no idea I don't know if there was an actual witch craft that was being practiced in the woods but I for one am not willing to declare someone a witch or war lock\nWithout hard evidence I feel bad\nFor professor Ford I also think I wouldn't want to be around her in the afterlife if she was lying we do know\nThat at least one of the accusers was lying\nWe want to believe people because we want to believe that there's no way anyone would do this\nFor politics that's the goodness in America don't lose sight of that goodness\nDo lose sight of the fairness that each American has that is why what is happening in Washington DC is going to bode very very poorly for those who are involved in this campaign\nBecause Americans are fair and what they've done to the capital of family is very public the process has given us a glimpse into what it looks like when the rule of law is replaced by a mob rule\nThis process has been ugly painful and hopefully it has taught us a big lesson the presumption of innocence is one of our founding principles heat is why we came here in the first place\nAnd if we abandoned that principle what happened to judge Kavanaugh will be the standard for all of us and our children\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nTry to cover them\nI guess maybe I should have taken off my doctor back in the white jacket or for that amount of ... a month to do I'm Still\nI still have to do in my care after uh doing a power our was to to\nTo ah to just to to be able to see is he capable of being president or um you know or or Supreme Court nominee in the future after drinking six beers as Brock Obama said he used to before he went to college now Bill O'Reilly is here hello bill\n[noise] back how you doing\nTime I'm I'm good I don't well how do you think this Kavanaugh things going to come down\nI think it'll be confirmed um tomorrow afternoon\nUm got as much as I said there's the forty at this time but\nI I think he's going to be very hard at the ... this last a\nGap for any Republican vote against them because there's new information and I don't know whether you guys know the new information because the media is not reporting it including Fox News morning to Wall Street\nJournal I'm Dr Ford's people that includes for lawyers and uh her advisors or tried to get a woman named Leo in Keizer to change her testimony that isn't the FBI report apparently\n... was the best friend to Christine Ford when this incident about Cabot allegedly took place and was named by Ford\nAn eye witness ... all along and said I don't remember anything like this I don't even know judge Kavanaugh will now the journals reporting that a forge people and they name a woman Monica McLean texted keys or and said hey you got to change your testimony you\nGotta help Christine that's a huge story\n... store\nThere is also another story um that are in the FBI testimony that it shows the leak came from Chuck Schumer that it was Chuck Schumer's office in cahoots with one of the beach ladies that Ford or talked about\nYeah well I don't think there's any doubt about Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein at this point that they are corrupt\nSo bill ... there he won more than one language\nMonica McLean by the way this was the woman who Ford's ex boyfriend\nTold the Senate Judiciary committee that Ford try to help her get through a lie detector test\nYep because she was applying for jobs at the FBI now bolsters the ex boyfriends um\nAccount now this may seem in the weeds but if the Judiciary Committee\nAnd I I Believe wrestling may do this I Hope so\nHe could hall monitor ... Monica ... uh and uh others in affords camp in front of the committee\nAnd he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if that happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it well I think it should it should should to here's here's the anybody\nKavanaugh allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart\nAnd what if this was coordinated it and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who is involved you know there was one guy who or what was it sue he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he ... he's been drinking this morning bill [laughter] wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] oh you have him arrested Yeah Bill I like to be drunk for all of your interviews with us okay the rights to them as a better state\nFor you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] drew as fair so I'm a ... there's there's one guy who came out and level the accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but look when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a ... yes this week say\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed\nIt doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're into that zone and we've discussed this before your interest Allen is\nYou are now we don't care yeah\nYou know if some guy didn't do something like having all whoever it may be and and and you get it and your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price\nYou gotta pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation ... doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation is what matters is\nIs communal justice\n[noise] that it it\nIs that other people are talking about in the media will never report on is it the same people that organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators\nAbout cabin on the same outfits are doing it move on leaves the league right they've got the mailing list they've got all the information I mean I'm sitting there going deja vu yeah\nSame people so now in addition to insanity like Alissa Milan all individual insanity then you have an organized coordinated effort with tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others\nOkay we're organizing sending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically the process and Americans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because it's not report it\nWill I Will tell you I listen to that stupid New York times podcast and listen to it every day just to hear what\nYou know what's being they're putting on it uh and it was that it might it made my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy\nA ... but one of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary they're very scary for reporters and for you know for the senators and and things are getting out of control the do you know\n... three Fifteen than when you went lazy [noise] what's your\nMy blood for this is not good my a blood pressure we're checking it against it science\nTo see if it's better to drink at moments like this do has already had a six pack as the Kavanaugh hearing is going on and Bill O'Reilly is here are my blood pressure's one forty five over Ninety eight and my pulse as one twenty\nOne forty five or Ninety eight that feels like really it's not good at that moment of ... that doesn't seem to look at all I I Want to try to get through or killing the s._s. was the only wanted to get drunk first yeah now that's how this works [laughter]\nDebate will come out what does it come out though is that a Tuesday so that really goes worse\nWar criminals in history Tuesday advance um\nAnd uh what's already sold Seventy five thousand in advance a sales\nAnd you'll have that and you only have Seventy one thousand instructor your car which is not yeah I Know\nAnd you know the gas is going up it's really\nYou know it's actually a really good book bill really warm in four minutes or to the vote senator Collins has just voted yes on the advancement she said will announce her final decision at three PM ac\n... again I mean because everyone thinks that this vote is going to be consistent with the vote that would happen this weekend or are we really thinking that she's going to change\nThis oh now show for the oil or Republicans\nWill vote for Kavanaugh because if they don't they're out of the Republican Party\nWell a lake it's it like and he's already out of it you know he's leaving easily that's\nTrue but I don't think flake wants to go out on that note remember flake wants to get a job as a lobbyist she wants to go around and give speeches maybe write a book if he's got the machine against him that's gonna hurt him in retirement as\nFar as good earnings are concerned yeah ... where he is\nStill I Want to ask you honestly Danes is if for Montana's leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was ... there's the really important vote and who knows what happened in twelve hours even\nIf something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave oh I really my daughters I leave you my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways to vote 'em but I look you know if your daughter's getting married daughters get married\nUm maybe they could move the ceremony later and they could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro ... some odd reason and he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they can make an exception I think but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right well she is believe me I Know that I thought were going that says if you want me to give you so now I go to the ... give us two minutes not an honor killing the ss\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very ... and\nRe your life yeah she's on me which is obviously but she loved me and thought I was good so they didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not um you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids or clerics abusing children um

I was amazed me\nWhere you don't have to just go see it in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah because comedy is very ... subject you can't tell them if you can tell him it's not funny right what\nThis guy's funny to me yeah so that's a that's what I've what I've experienced ... so\nUh you know one of the things that when I when I uh\nWas I feel like do they tell you it looked like somebody\nDoes it do you want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders just like I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter]\nThat was going to go to a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this before he looked like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good looking man [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable I have a new world set or the other [laughter] I was a ... and now this isn't helping because history I'm going into what's going on what I propose to my wife yeah she said no [laughter] and uh and\nWhat do you sell on ... ... what year was a citizen of IDs okay yeah okay [laughter] they're rational respond right than I did alright yeah I was just trying to get an era right out of the others\nSo she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God on everything and she said you don't go to church and I said I see you every Sunday after church and every time\nYou come home talking about the people who were honking at each\nOther and yelling yeah they're running the park oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah\nIt's crazy yeah it's crazy how people are in church and they're finding that but they're like they're looking at their watch the news\n... yeah yeah yeah they won out which of these ... these video mountain road rage and the church parking lot is like make all these ...\nI make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of them don't just probably like your content of your books yet sometimes when people are like yes thank you we needed that sometimes you put your heart and soul into something like\nYou're like what was that one that connected are now that one connected ... yeah 'cause you know I don't think you'd have to be a Christian too or good church going person to you've heard about that mhm from your wife ... they like yeah I Know how it goes and they're like yeah then it's just the\nThe what's funny is the juxtaposition of ... that you know God first survivors [laughter]\nYeah yeah how are you losing ... ... steps away\nThe human spirit wouldn't you say like if you like you see someone on T. V. and they're given a rundown and you just go that's not right\nIt doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human ... like you can spot in sincerity and why that everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show 'cause you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come to ...\nSo to get to become an idea yeah overeating up on ... ... people\nPeople are like stabbing each\nOther we have a ticket to that's what I that's our goal you're right I mean it's a good clean comedy show you want a few good yes at the ticket to people the\nPeople are like ...\nWhenever I tell a joke it's like a cross the line I go oh stop I I Know you've got a text each other this personally you're young and I know like right when the radio when the lights go off you know like if there's an interview like come on it would be real this guy\nLike because that's how you generally said on the late ... yeah that's a human\nNBL I feel like I've connected with you 'cause you're like to sew somebody's like salads somebody's like telling us the truth out here yeah you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy\nHard in two thousand Eighteen I go I think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you don't have to say anything [laughter] right mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say the most profane disgusting\nI never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but it into does anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up the individual actually felt yeah that's the only thing left shocking you really are feeling and want to say but you don't\nAs I I Can't believe you said that yeah oh yeah well I have a joke at my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians and have you ever been driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side throws I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does why why everyone and vet\nThat joke has stayed in my show for about four years because it every button yeah you have what's at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy who all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some ... some might\nActually have to learn [laughter] the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like\nIf if if we can notch him down\nI feel like that's why the tabloids exist that's why the outrage exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay I Am [laughter] you know they they're like I'm Better than that [laughter] much better that there was always when everybody started out and even\nPlaying field and then you get you know that's what you get rich or famous or successful or the\nCEO see you'll be down here and him be up here is not sit well with people so if we can somehow expose them as a human\nAnd that's what I I've studied my act for a long to every scandal that ever comes out past their politics athlete that headline should be person acts like human mhm right\nYeah well no matter like might be able to say well some of them [laughter] some of them aren't related I mean it was ... he was drinking after a long day America\nYeah yeah I got to get that yeah that makes sense yeah or like our he\nYou know is the kind of the thing I don't want to get into politics our guys but on the thing with Kavanaugh was agree or disagree on how it goes or whatever\nPeople who said I Can't believe he was angry you rely\nOn January ... you can you know there's no human on the planet now that you wouldn't go okay enough\nOkay yeah we were like ... there's and there's no avenue for like defense he'd have like yeah\nLike people with somebody came after us the ugly we have jokes about kids with like allergies\nAnd we kind of like make fun of other guys laugh come on [laughter] out after ... years ago\nThey used to be like back in the day you know like you know like my dad knew how to like tile the bathroom he knew how to ... mixed race gate he knew these men and if you'd like asked my dad when he was literally like I Do you need a jacket back now as presents\nNinety eight point three envy being ten W well ac [noise]\n...
