{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "And here it is that there's this they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been targeted attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was a flight out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they bowed miserable you'd think the president maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating a fax frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... adds to\nDo it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people to hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again\nA right to have your back\nYet it can be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nWere coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nKind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus\nThe the outright hatred for men\nAnd I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been\nTaught and heard on the news and talking to her she made literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um ah you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine hook up at it right by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look\nLike that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get notarized after the dates\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush Limbaugh ... voice on the right ... fees Mitt for\nThe charges are upsetting a and and uh they're obviously they triggered an entire a national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are treated in this country\nAt the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence for any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story that is the story and I for one I for one we'll not\nCondemn Ford and I will not condemn a a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm and we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nNeither listening to ... so [noise]\nIn my book addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of\nOf why we should really be talking about something entirely different why we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true in the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving nobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking\nThe question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both\nBuddies it on the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having it now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing month how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I Am great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not talk about\nWhat capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and a lot of the things that we're talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show\nAnd and you you're talking about this big war this is a cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about the Trump Administration or about capitalism in general\nThese are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean\nYou're going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most viable ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak outta thug nobody's going to take you off to prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars it completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of\nFreedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives are most of my [noise] my my left wing friends or family that I care about poverty\nIn ... and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believe [laughter]\nAnd and their their obligation instruct their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works full you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system it pulled people up to billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your\nYou know absolute so from Nineteen Seventy\nAnd killed today you know when when you and I were really little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on I was really in the seventies when people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until two eighty percent of the world poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been ever advocate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is that ... billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation in poverty Glenn since you and our\nKids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it\nAs Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are ... are wielding at but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got wrapped now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C.\nAnd in every state Capitol around the country that's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter] so so competition is good competition politics and economics and the competition of ideas the fact is that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a friend democratic nation is very very important [noise]\nAnybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nAll of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you\nHow do you reconcile that uh because I don't want to take money away from people\nRight now I got it glad and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of\nBuilt in ... around the castle and that kept a\nBunch of wealth and the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a those basically that's a system of wired deals that you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more\nOr whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got\nWe have to democratize opportunity the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom non so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience the ... the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs were who were just like scratching\nOut potatoes some ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that makes sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [noise]\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there is\nA system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university is four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't try is today that's that's the really an American thing and why can't they rise\nThey can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational in technical education systems which are the ultimate educational reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly Klein [laughter] we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college for people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did the printed system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd in you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and personal initiative without going to college\nAmazing or there but it's it's that early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens times since we've seen is amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies\nWith more Arthur Brooks and is America worth saving\nYou know radio the office no problem you can stream I show live at W. L. A. C. dot com\nRight that mid term so I'm going out of for a a tour if this is going to be a blast does October twenty fifth in San Antonio\nHouston the twenty six Dallas the twenty seventh then November first enrichment Hershey on the second November third is Pittsburgh then I think we'd go up to Cleveland than the election happens oh is this going to be fun\nOh man right before the election and just

like the the last uh the last ... we did was serious or isn't it the one here in Dallas Cowboy stadium yeah I think so and so the last ... comedy tour was two thousand nine or\nTwo thousand and it was all but it's been nominees and thought it was common sense yeah yeah it's been a long time so you joined us there's lots of fun to join us ... tickets Glenn Beck dot com slash to her okay back with a Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute\nArthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm yeah however ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry 'cause we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is it's got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden as it\nGoes on and and by the way there are some people standing in for the ... constitution guys like Glenn Beck you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and throwing good\nThe big problem is that there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment and on campuses on the right and the left or or just dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glenn unite we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically that's\nFine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we were just really have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about the things that really bring us together and then tried to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I said capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nI Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time the way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive into say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because he is your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people\nIs to is to give voice to the fact that you you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right and get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it and\nMake the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise un entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments 'cause most I think even most conservatives fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden can you describe what that is\nAnd listen to his podcast I highly encourage it um and he is also the president of the American Enterprise Institute [noise]\nClan that\nWeek days on the blaze started your morning with ...

immediately somebody's even bluffing at the table I've got this they fold they don't want to fight they're not willing to fight\nDonald Trump allowed this to happen and Kevin I would've been completely discredited I think under any other president he would have just gone away discredited because they would have said you know what it's not worth it we don't believe those charges and he

pretty regular basis\nAnd I guess they should be used to it by now but um you know that's why that's why people voted for him yeah for for this very reason he's willing to ... he's willing to stand and make this fight because he believes in it\nThat it's an it's ... it's just nothing I really didn't think he had it in it yeah you know we've talked about it before\nYou've got to admit when you're

what's the best way\nTo get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be
