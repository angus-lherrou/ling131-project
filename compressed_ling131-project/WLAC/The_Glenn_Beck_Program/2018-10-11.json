think the one friday actually draw more eyeballs that the previous debates have been hosted by well like the Tennessee in and you could watch it on line but it didn't get much visibility so I think the debate last night probably got a lot more eyeballs and people paying more attention\nAnd then of course we have this project very tough video drop right after\nThat debate which which should have been the big conversation in the mainstream media today and again other than here other than in Tennessee star um Breitbart has it uh Sean Hannity is going to have the story tonight it's not\nGoing to get the mainstream media coverage that a story like this should get as you see inside the British and campaign confirmation of what we've been saying for a while that Bill Bryson doesn't mean what are you saying that he would not have voted for Brett Kavanaugh had he actually been in the U.S Senate he's just saying that to try to\nTo move some moderate Republican votes in his direction and and feel like I'm not going to lose the Democrats 'cause 'cause they're desperate enough that they're going to vote for me even if I Am saying I'm going to vote for a guy that that according to\nDr Blasey Ford is a sexual predator according to a ms Ramirez is a is a rapist according to Bob Michel ... who's going to run for president as a Democrat in two years is a serial orgy organizer I mean despite all that the president says he would have voted for a ...\nOf course that was uncorroborated evidence unlike\nThe statements of the British and campaign workers where there's corroborating evidence in actually video for this you can see that tendency started to come into what he actually thinks [laughter] you know I Love it from an investigative point of view because now we're going to be looking at those four or five workers and a campaign\nWorkers and see who's actually paying that it'd be very interesting to see or they unpaid\nThey've apparently not paid by the campaign at least we can see in terms of a salary expenditures um gee I Wonder if it's you know some outside institution like that to the uh the aid to the unpaid intern in Sheila Jackson leaves office\nWho's paid by an outside institution\nOf the house Democrats and it reads and I quote it shall be unlawful for a private health insurers to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this\nAct

know all of the piece the stuff the me too which hadn't\nThey say there were seven distinct clusters now in America progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberals politically disengaged moderates traditional conservatives and devoted conservatives\nNow according to the report twenty five percent of Americans are traditional or devoted conservatives twenty five percent\nWow wow that's really low\n\nWill only eight percent of Americans are progressive activists\nExcuse me\nTheir views are even more out of the mainstream and are less typical two thirds of Americans do not belong in either extreme\nAh ... extreme progressive as progressive activists or as traditional devoted conservatives\nThe vast majority is now considered something called the exhausted majority\nThe members of this two thirds of our society share a sense of fatigue with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible in their political viewpoints and uh have a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority this like political correctness\nAmong the general population eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it Seventy four percent ages twenty four to twenty nine and Seventy nine percent under the age of twenty four I think this is a problem\nVote woke are in the extreme minority in this country\nYouth not supporting political correctness and they're not supporting the race thing either\nWhites are ever so slightly less than average to believe political correctness is a problem in the country\nWhites\nSeventy nine percent share that sentiment instead Asians eighty two percent Hispanics eighty seven percent Native Americans eighty eight percent\n\nOne

those whites are standing up to protect\nHelpless Native American\nI think that's the thing that gets me the most are the people who are not it's it's almost like how did you get into this conversation how are you what part of this conversation you're not you're not the one that is the red scare and\nHow are you standing up and telling Native Americans how they're supposed to feel when they don't feel that way in poll after poll after poll\nOne part of the standard narrative of the data\nPartially affirmed is that African Americans are most likely to support political correctness but the difference between them and other groups is much smaller than generally supposed three quarters of African Americans oppose political correctness three quarters\nThis means there are only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe the political correctness is a real problem in America\nWell eighty three percent of respondents make a a who make less than fifty thousand dollars disliked political correctness Seventy percent of those who make more than a hundred thousand are skeptical\n...\nYou want to know why

that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this this incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... puppet accounts\nYou were talking about a moving target people who are deleting their house changing their information making new accounts staying active so that they can't actually be attracted to it and given location and if Morton ... researcher at USC could prove definitively that

the thought in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see

C. dot com [noise]\nGlenn Beck weekday mornings at age on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and dean ten WN lazy\nYou're listening to Glenn Beck program\nHelen plug grows a is a a scientist in um\nIn England she is the editor in chief of Barrow magazine and she is a uh\nShe's an academic or in exile now I'm Ellen I I yesterday I spent a couple of hours with a doctor Denver so do you know her\nYeah\nSo um we were talking and she said you know Glenn is a very small number of people who are actually knowingly engaged in the\nSilencing and every every with everything else and you kind of said the same thing that you think there's a very small minority but for the power structure has changed it has been flipped on its head a and and I I don't understand\nThat maybe they maybe it is a very small number but they are very powerful I'm In the fact that they have you know otherwise never so wouldn't have told me that you know even tenure couldn't have saved her job had she stayed\nUm you know a Weinstein the and what happened to him and his his wife I mean it is it's stunning the effect that is happening in our culture and the way the media is not standing for common sense\nIt yet but I I I'd I'd like to address that the actual like just wanted to say that an ... path right to the times is as scientists that I I think\nIt was the research on that ah yeah I I Am\nNot a ... students and that there is a philosophy that James is a mathematician that he does that engaged in the humanities I wouldn't want people today thank you on mistaken thank you and it we scientists\nBut yes I Know I think we can talk and I said I mean we we do have to have to look at how powerful\nThey are not activities now is set in institutions and the ugly tricks I Will say that it that it is and I just they just powerful role as a society but he'll country and mine has recently voted conservative\nAnd I think this is an apology to do with some of the strange\nUnited States rising on the left which has caused many it with such a centrist and eating left to go to the right as a as a leftist I'd like them to come back again so that that is why they see it as kind of sense to me\nAnd it may or may not be there and ask you for clarification swimming I I think and I'm I'm not sure uh especially over in England but I think\nThat there is a misunderstanding sometimes with the press there are bad people who are you know racist and ... and everything else\nBut I think that they're this multiculturalism has taken people to a place to where they are you know English are are proud of you know their culture and you know you either like the queen or you don't like the queen I think most people are like yeah it's you know it's part of our tradition but we shouldn't be paying for it\nUm and the multiculturalism that has made it a racist to even say yeah I'm proud to be be English\nOr I'm proud to be American I think that is being taken as racist where I don't think it's meant as racist by the vast majority of people they're just proud of who they are and where they came from\nWell I I I certainly agree with that I I don't see the problem as\nAs multiculturalism itself I and I'm In London and then and we generally do quite well with this race and yet this different ... that as great ranges as different coaches are located on than it is quite than\nIt is quite excited you go to Chinatown and you can trace it to say if they were also yes some and because it will probably this with a lack of a simulation with with some great not books\nThe I did that and it is it is prejudiced too and he had to take to like a tradition\nThat that that is a problem and I don't think it is very late and conservatives who say that it's\nA problem I don't know if you're familiar with John height is low foundations yes which pets and disloyalty and this like a tradition outlook conservative\nSide I see quite a lot of based on the liberal side too and I think on the far left and mistake alike if one's own traditions and culture and as I could say everybody else's and as a form of racism and all that she can nice and some tea and\nKnow I'd been better luck up about three\nOr four days we've found at the stock market you're right about that and\nAnd uh so I'm like but I remain pretty bullish\nUm look at the doubters down down to twenty five thousand four hundred was up you know well over twelve hundred points I'd rather not a week ago uh I like to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation is that I Am\nWell I met I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWell good question we're all scratching our heads wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those facts of of ah\nFat changes are short term so I don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we don't see real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to this is\nThe fed and and a ... journal Jerome Powell why you're taking a punch bowl away from this party just when it's getting boring and I tend to\nI tend to think that he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just as good as the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and in ... new believe we should watch your guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean\nLook I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I Do predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we have international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nThat trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down an affordable and so I ... my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that was and that's where I Am a little concerned by the way I go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why hasn't gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe not near where you just I don't get why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the I'm In the middle east with respect to Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\nYou know about the price of the global\nReduction in suppliers result\nIs going to accept back online bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think well prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it or you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick\nIn the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again\nSo [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know this\nThe stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's a true except for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife I let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me let me ask you this I don't know if this is true\nOr this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the bed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and then we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last weekend and why the president is the chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but\nI I think there's a lot of ... one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years\nThat these are not some kind of or a falls on high at the fed they act as if there was a temple with\nAll of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes you mentioned\nI remember the seventies as you do when we had literally ... percent mortgage interest rates that was all because the fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in through the thousand seven and they all yeah I keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think Steven [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that ... are good\n[laughter] here's my view and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um\nI Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a tool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the the kind of apocalyptic\nView has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a ... or where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before the\nThe deal has to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating stealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know\nThe old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using that's all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to try and let\nMe challenge you on that whenever I uh you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about that it's like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy in Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look we're not gonna give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to play by the rules I talked to company CEOs all the time of mine who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market\nYou got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your a trade secret ... I mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nThey don't want that from our side I don't think people want it from their side new research shows eighty percent of the American people feel the same way\nA good plan where we now\nKnow radio at the office no problem you can stream I show alive at W.

I mean the trend is not increasing that we we have one year that had more than another year is that what you're trying because I'm asking you in the last ten years have we seen a cup of these ... these\nSo called natural disasters\nI Want us in the last couple of years thank you for your question NBC yeah there has been an increase from all over the years ... very much [laughter] that journalism these days it is here's what the\nPCC says remember this is Al Gore's a favorite place to go for climate information and this is what they say about hurricanes numerous studies tours and beyond the fifth assessment report of the Irish ... eh PCC have reported\nA di di di di di\nGreasing trend in the global number of ... of tropical cyclones\nAnd or the global globally accumulated psychotic energy there's low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cycle numbers under global warming over the past four decades there's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trends in the global number of very intense cyclists the\nView and I may see see reports the latest the latest update\nTo bring out of a boring un talk what they're saying is total number of a hurricane's going down and there is low confidence in any change in the I'm In ... like what they say it's like well because they used to say there's going to be more frequent intense hurricanes then they realized the frequency thing wasn't happening there it's got to be more intense they don't even have evidence of that\nAnd so that gives me Mr ... here is this not the strongest storm a ... on record did that is hit value Florida Panhandle that is the report you sir I rest now here's the summary\nUh the PCC once again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes and tornadoes have increased much less increased due to a greenhouse gases that exactly the story you're getting on the media when they're trying to say it would have tenure so we have renewed\nThis they've they've they've up to their commitment and in response I tell them\nUp yours [laughter] so [laughter] ah [laughter] it is a pretty remarkable okay let me let me ask you this as we get into the poll numbers\nI Believe there is a chance we see a red wave because of Kavanaugh than we were concerned\nThat there would be this massive blue blue wave in both the house and the Senate I think we see a red wave not a tidal wave but a red wave\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if if the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I like these things go away for example uh the the Access Hollywood tape\nHappened right about this time in two thousand sixteen\nRight about now Tobar eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact on news ... I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left\nIt alone leclaire Williams\nBut they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people I'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when when they go low we kick them\nAnd the crowd cheers and ... and ... with this is who the new Democratic Party is amazing amazing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Nashville", "day": "11"}
