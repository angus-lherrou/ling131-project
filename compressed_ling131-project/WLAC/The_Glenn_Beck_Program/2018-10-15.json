I Love the president I Love what he's doing\nBut I'm definitely glad that the more black people are waking waking up to see what's going on up and talking to you know the answer back people all the time where am I talk to them about Trump\n... him all the time not of the un simple black and white people and it gets very irritating at times but I'm going to keep talking but I don't want them to communism to take over a mile race as a black person and I don't want to go back to the same wherever you are\nEven though I might get in trouble for it we were out back then and we are now I'm going to say but of course I Can't say that but I mean\nHow do you think this Bloomberg takes away guns for minorities will play the people you talked to Bernadette your first of all they're not going to see it in the news the tendency is not going to cover the television stations in Nashville aren't going to cover the national news media isn't going to cover it but as you talk to African Americans will have a story of a tendency star dot com near the next hour or so\nHow do you think that will play if they know the Democrats who were supporting Phil Bredesen want to take away their constitutional rights\nWell it's not going to be mad about it because most of them got their on their legally anyway especially the ones who are going to be totally angry about it\nThat got out there or they have their God illegally so they're not gonna care whether Bloomberg wants to take away because they're not going to do it anyway but they're like black people we have been\nBrainwashed over the last ... years that's totally believe everything the team and crap today and I'm from back for that item off that democratic plantation because I just can't take it I just really can't take it but we're not going to feel we know that that people think that Democrats are\nTo be on in all of everything in that state this life spray it and we're gonna continue going around social it because we are not we are not leader that the rates are lower we believe everything everybody said oh the\n... the Hollywood and musicians rappers and we don't want to hear anything else and then we they only want

program when\nI started writing an essay last night and I'm at I posted up on ... face but but I I I spent some time going over it with you [noise]\nYou know the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse and it's really not that's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find it being sad\nIs in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up and parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is and uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said\nLook not so long ago\nI spent ... years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed up\nOn us so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that\nBecause I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a [noise]\nIt's just the saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse\nI personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorce everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that it took a dark chapter in my life that that taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you\nAre you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you through enlightenment through correction new understandings\nHumility it's up to you so living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we'll learn the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility in DC in Hollywood of a story today to tell you about Michael ... who's now quitting the music industry\nHe says he's tired of the celebrity nonsense\nEverybody on the left and the right we all have an ego problem we're utterly convinced that our side is absolutely right and if you violate that if you violate one part of that you're a traitor you're a traitor to the race the party the cause whatever\nThey are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong but there is there is truth\nBut I don't think any of us are really looking for at least a large section isn't looking for it we are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut he is ... is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us I personally think it's an ... problem all of us both sides all of us and\nMaybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer recognize what what is true even about our own lives\nBecause everything that we print in post most of it is ally one way or another subtler bold its ally\nAnd why is that\nBecause we'd been marketed to ever since we were born all of us if you were born after Nineteen fifty you were marketed to your whole life\nEspecially now it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse you are not complete unless you wear consume you own your vacation at or you don't buy products a or B\nYou're not complete you're not good enough you're not complete you have to have this product but now we're being told that\nYou can't even be part of the great new society unless we believe and champion product politician or party a B or C opinions now our products as well that you must embrace and where somebody else's not yours\n\nAnd now we're in the final stages where we ourselves are products companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon and YouTube\nWe're not a customer\nWe're now the commodity were the thing they're selling oh you want this group of people that want to buy these things here they are\nIf you can't fill in the line I Am blank if you can't fill that in\nWith an actual word and be it complete happy satisfied excited or I Am worthless\n\nIf you don't fill it in yourself somebody ... somebody else will and marketers are trying to fill that in for you you buy this product and you can say I am cool or I Am in style I Am rich I Am smart do you buy Democrat\nAnd you can say I am compassionate\nYou by the Democratic label I Am smarter than others I Am science minded than it does it even matter if you really are it doesn't matter if you've ever given a dime or given any time to anything just by buying this label you are compassionate\nIt's the label that everybody needs now\nIf you want to buy Republican well then you get to be patriotic guy unpatriotic I support our troops I support family values it doesn't matter if you're a whore in it every night you're by the Republican label you can say that by the Christian label and you can do whatever you want\nYou just use religion to excuse you or others in their behavior\nBy the label progressive\nOh my gosh I Am science minded even though you deny basic biology\nLabels like courage I he has courage that has a price\nTag now but don't buy now because the price of courage is going lower and lower for a while for a while this\nThis was a time a revered label you actually had to earn this but now it can be yours simply by saying things out loud in a room full of people who all agree with you and we'll cheering clap when you finally say what they're thinking fats\nCourage oh half such carnage\nLabels and words are experiencing a fire sale and it seems everything must go now\n\nBut once that fire sale is over something else happens and what comes next forces people to earn their labels and that's the world we're about to\nEnter and I actually think it's a blessing not occurs\nI'll explain when we come back\nAmerican financing there are benefits to refinancing your mortgage right now you\nOh crap their turn to stand and do the right thing it's what they did with their crisis that made others years later bestow upon them the title the greatest generation\n\nWell I don't know if you noticed this but ah we're living in a time of great crisis set up people and I don't think it's going to India and be much different or a smaller scale than the great struggles of the past\nAnd in that struggle all of the labels that we think we have now will fall away all of those that have been bought will become worthless\nAnd every new label for each of us will be purchased with blood sweat tears or actual courage\n\nAnd what we face in the end is not going to be\nSmaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world wars\nIt's not going to be any less frightening than the\nGlobal economic unrest in the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be greater either it's just going to be hours\nAnd just like the generations gone by it'll be our choice whether or not we survive\nI think this is a blessing\nThe boomers never got to see who they really were\nThe boomers feast it off the crisis of their parents they never really had to choose for themselves\nLike the greatest generation did life or death freedom or slavery they never had to push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\nThe crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing it's a blessing our parents never received each of us it's going to have to\nChoose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come who we really are if we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see this struggle in the proper light we did Mitt that it's the softness of our foundations that have caused all these troubles it's\nAre wanting an easier life not making the hard choices not having to say no not having to say yes\nBut Brock Obama nor Donald Trump or the problem or the solution there symptom look

if you're in Portland they're they're they're at your feet right now who are you Portland\nWhat is it the really believe are you going to sit and let people destroy\nDestroyed a great city that you have\nYou have all of us are honest and we really look at our situation we all know we all see the same symptoms we all know that we as a nation or sick were really really sick and we have\nWe have each of us have doctors and their each prescribing the opposite medicine and each of us as\nThe patients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our society\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family say that's not the cure\nBecause we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become more vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\nWith the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing\nAnd while we're all fighting over the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were just too busy fighting what our doctor said\n\nNo I don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know this society is sick we are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally I usually am not good at making friends at that point\nI don't think you are either we snap at each other we\nAct as our lesser selves because when I'm sick I'm I hurt and I am full of despair or I'm fearful\nOr I just don't have the patience and every time I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad most difficult day every day it seems and it gets worse every day\n\nI Want to those doctors to know I Want those\nI don't want those to know that actually do just want to watch the world to burn I Want you to know that it's true we know there are dangers in difficulties crisis that lie ahead of us\nBut don't just assume that we're just going to lie down and watch our country burned down it's not\nIn fact many if not most of us who voted for Democrats and those who voted for Republicans have a ton in common and Italian gum and with those who voted for neither well the parties and the politicians try to convince as otherwise\nAnd many of us may have believed for a while or even engaged in this warfare it's becoming more and more clear to more and more Americans that our neighbors are not the enemy\nNo matter who they voted for and if you're not there yet or your neighbors not there yet\nAsked them to ponder this\nWho in your family came here I don't care if it was three months ago or three centuries ago why did they come here they came here to make a better life\nFrom a country that would not allow them to follow their dream for one reason or another from a country that that didn't value hard work\nTo a country that didn't value hard work and allowed you to keep what you belt so you could live better than you did before or you could have a better life than your parents or your grandparents you could afford a better life for your children so they could achieve even more than you did\nLike him not like her stopped comparing yourself\nCan we be\nBetter than we were yesterday\nIf we can do that and see each other in the best light put our past in the past and our strife and are coming crisis in the right right light down the road down the road\nAfter we've done all of this hard work some other generation that will come along we look back and name and give a label\nTo us I Believe that label is going to be good I Believe that label could be great but one thing is for sure it will not be the one we choose it will be the label we have earned\n[noise]\nOnto this half hour is simply safe [noise] simply say you know what I Love it simply safe is the

program reading out from the paper I wrote previously with Peter ... the ... as a social construct\nAnd I ended up killing one of these [laughter] hey hey\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned a lot of fun I live in LA fun right hum that innocence\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway right [laughter] that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took the criticisms we got from that to heart\n... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge like a couple of thousand\n... ... it's really kind of a a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to address\nIt a secondly we decided that\nUm we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about her results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong\nBut it's it's not what happened um and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already so he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nAll the easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked also very very\nHard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same as you talk to hell in the other day yeah uh so I this was an an immense amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and no one has a little bit of background in some of this\nBut this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing Arthur only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for ten years there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you told those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten pulled\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so uh as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these\nPapers a hand to\nHand article where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nAlright are

L. A. C. dot com\nOn TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen ten W LA scene\nGlad that\nWe're talking to Dr James Lindsey author of life in light of death or he is or even follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the ... if not the mastermind behind a the a\nPapers a of record that were were being written\nA for for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique to but\nI'm not really critique in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just its existence as an act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to\nListen and learn throughout the semester which means faced aren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to\nThe degree privileged classroom learning environment and the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the ... over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist\nIn a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the debt for a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a [noise] a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over him interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what\nWhat would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year so they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some\nSums are educators primarily working and social justice size field topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nUh and now the power is out it hit with a little warning and that happens with earthquakes and fires and\nTo be a major disruptions to following these things is you know we get

reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit got now how the woman goes into a clinic comes out of data there is\nNo police report and I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions natural course of the movie is amazing Cormac God's know is perhaps the most ... American who bring friends and family you do not want to pass a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion goes no\nTo control the Senate and a really bad shape to continue their control of the house [noise]\nI mean look at the X. dream policies that the left is looking to push in\nThrough the Democratic party free health care [noise]\nSingle payer sorry single payer health\nCare free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger\nA infrastructure package then what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than ten I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there but many of them were cosponsors of the bill or it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just signed\nUp to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college they know that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place the state's said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything\nWell then ... what\nDo we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt'll be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right\nI might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that uh and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump's sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by city\nI mean as you know it'd be which ... who wants that like as a Republican I certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way writer should\nRun themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural areas can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's\nHeaded by the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the head out\nRight and you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would if if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThey way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next ... the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way\nSo you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was slower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto saying if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nLike I don't see how this is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find\nIt's unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed [laughter]\nAre you arguing for king right with these the several stories in our own the ... give you the argument for a king\nRight I mean okay really they've failed or have we not been using them properly\n\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] uh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure part right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but\nThe idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane\nInsane absolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but\nI I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... last week the\nPortland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ...\nCan anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just can I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [laughter] I mean especially with a union job\nWould be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter]\n[noise] what ... what what\nLaws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him\nDown police nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how\nHow how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of\nLook this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ...\nIs your job sucking the life out of you wake up you can do
