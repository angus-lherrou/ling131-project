poll\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even even when I listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are ... are headed out when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product\nIn search results uh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving\nNo more than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou do that is scary\nIt is you um you lead us out in the in the um creepy line I'm about\nHow Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know the ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this and national a study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy thing there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and without leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results have felt like a news story than just\nIt stays there for people to look at it's generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays or in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is\nThe system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda [noise] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article a called\nA can of ways big tech can shift millions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nAre that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm sending seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences and they're ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well into thousands sixteen early she was out of the sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using\nThe Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results\nNow that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme wow or see leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh\nYou know Irish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nThey Epstein so what kind of a it's a strange rule somebody told me that it's a always the you know if the ... is the last ah ... the last in the in the duo\nThan it's fine if it's easy it's Eighteen and my the voters making that up my I think they just make it up [laughter]\nNo no no no no no everyone says I'm Stein no one's\nEver seen it oh okay so [laughter] [noise] excuse me uh so you were just about to give me more good news\nWill know the good news is again you you you do not share your emails with Google a lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do but it's bad news is that\nA Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so what that means ... everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in\nThe yeah for sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and their products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\n[laughter] uh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is a film that you mentioned the creepy lie has\nA when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer on your show recently of is a uh he's the one who would who really got that film running\nA it sure wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tense for for rental or sale and it it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just go to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... where you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\n[noise] well when I when my research a first hit the news and the Washington Post\nA you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any\nGoogle products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so I have these amazing screen shots that they're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have screen shot showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nIt's amazing okay let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last\nSeven ten or ten of these that you're\nFollowing or can't altogether okay out all the other okay so let's take on one real quick begin very good when ... here we go this is called bath as\nThe er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar\nYou are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill buy one having any idea that they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay\nWe're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll\nTalk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line\nIt's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com\nLand back on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than double the ... the\nThe climate probably Roger Robert ... he's a senior research psychologist American Institute for behavioral research and\nTechnology he is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about a guy saw again it is indeed very creepy it is um\nIt's it's is it too much to say it's\nMore on the ... were asked mind control or the threshold of mind control soccer\n[noise] [noise] ah well we've been here for a long time so there's a you know there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than two point five billion people soon to be over four billion\nA whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected\nA dramatically uh every single day by a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that's that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you you you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the targeting charts the shura targeted messaging T Emmy\nWe call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect\nIs really scary this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others but if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional four hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh\nI don't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was gonna win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data\nThat that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't what targeted advertising is all that\nAbout but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something last jak competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive ...\nI mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside fi you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] [noise]\nOh yeah so they can they in fact they know who's unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented power or\nTwo is shifts people yes shift unstable people's shifts anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power uh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you wanna get creep out [laughter]\nUh you know Google and Facebook meticulous there are so powerful and so imbedded that you just ... you can't really cut into them people people don't want to leave them people or you know they they love them\nAnd so it's hard you know I Know lots of people working on alternative kinds of you know ... services and\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people that'll be past four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing\nAnd found so it's ... ... what they're doing in China I mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\n[noise] [noise] well that's outrageous that is ... because they're actually they're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate in the Chinese government's\nA aggressive a program to control all of its citizens and Google is ... ... ... and that I mean literally making it easier and better\nMaking that kind of system easier and better that's ... that's s outrageous\nDoctor I Would I Would love to uh fly you in and spend a couple of hours with you and and have you on regularly to to be able to monitor and help in any way that we can to get the word out this is\nThis is the thing that I think America and the world should be concentrating on and no one's talking about the world is being redesigned by a handful and we're just not aware of it and it's going to change overnight a doctor thank you so much\nI really appreciate absolutely you bet it's been an honor true on our Glen thank you very much Dr Robert\n...

Cormac\nAnd I ended up killing one of these pay pay\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned it was fun I live in LA fun right hum happiness is don't exist but they called all of our problems anyway right [laughter] that\nUm but yeah so we learned our\nLesson we we took the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work\nPeople criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nA couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people\nContinue to address a secondly we decided that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about her results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened on and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our problem is\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who was interested in the stuff already so he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nAll the easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project came out to the public\nEye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked also very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and you talk to hell in the other day yeah\nUh so I this was an an immense amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and no one has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process\nAnd then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career\nIs to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I pay ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered her tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines that pay first got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you at the un un twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA

he is one of the vote if not the mastermind behind\nA the a papers a lot of record that were were being written a for for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critique to no way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of object to vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey judge it says this is a sovereign act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to\nBe in a very privileged classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this\nSet of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes and they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the ... over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort\nWhich means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step\nFrom what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad\nEnough [noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death 'cause a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a scholarly papers\nThey claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um the the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n... if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would [noise] what's that mean\nSo all these answers a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year so this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some\nSome uh educators primarily working and social justice side or the\nFields topics courses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to",
