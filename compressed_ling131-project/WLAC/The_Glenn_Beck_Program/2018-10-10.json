K. R. and will make that one of the questions you know will you disavow Hillary Clinton's\nCall for lack of civility will you disavow the Maxine Waters and the others that are that are calling for violence threats and intimidation as we pointed out in the last half hour if you look at the dictionary definition of terrorism\nOf course she responds by hardening her face into that stony grin Hillary Clinton certainly astonishing\nProgram\nThe nice thing though about Hillary Clinton everybody knows you ...\nYou know what I mean every nobody buys nobody buys her act anymore no which is really nice to really well CNN Christiana unimportant she still buys into it\nYeah I I don't know that I Would really\nMake that distinction matter who who cares what she thinks\nReally either of them I mean I I mean it's a voice is that I I almost can't here I guess so little about where to look like they're cutting woods in a foreign head [laughter] and I are falling and nobody's airing it and I'm In the middle of a city\nYeah many many hundreds of miles away I cannot hear the trees fall I Try to remember I watch something that was so outrageous\nLast night was it and I thought to myself wow I'm really not outraged I don't care and I just don't care\nIt's hard I mean there's a lot of stuff today I mean they're you know the things that the people that are trying to cover this election and the you know the cabin on thing are actually saying I mean they're incredible it's as if they don't care what the words they're saying mean well well well\nFor instance let's let's use this because we're changing definitions of words are here is um\n[noise] uh here's Brooke Baldwin on CNN they're talking about how we we we we've got to be\nCareful because people are going to be hurt because worse to where we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob you're not going to use the word is totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that there's no other way it's going to put a stop on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia too long ago right what we saw chasing me right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or that a mob I think if he is only a mob yeah and if it were the party or as we call it a mob ... come on\nI ... I mean because I saw a lot of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court and banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because their votes were supposed to be in a civil society right now I can\nRemember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children you\nKnow and the homemade signs how many people they chase down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill she and a was a John Lewis\nMarched out in to the crowd in to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember where\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\n[noise] can you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and\nBrett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC and not have been pretty it would not have been\nPretty and by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob they're charging cities and they're taking over that's the I shouldn't that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that their usage so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying to ... percent on causing ... tent on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not the only thing trouble I mean if you going to go down that road I guess in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right it just says intent on causing trouble right it doesn't\nSay you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm\nSaying though is that the media does not see harassing conservatives as causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a currency that that's like a you know there\nIt's basically you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that you know [laughter] things better yeah I mean they are learning by the Irish guy this other art [laughter] let me tell you many white people those are white people really do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob BS I'm going to call it a mob\nA now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtesters guaranteed to a a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us by the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the post\nI mean I guess they would claim that's like border enforcement right\nLike yeah that's border enforcement that'll offering than ... yeah the ... the law they're claiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism I'm a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities who could that be [laughter]\nI I I Know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that\nReligious majorities it's the left conservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the United states stored socialism yet did that one because that's what's happening\nThat's what did happen I ask a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah that's a it's a crazy accusations rice point\nMany on the left warn that fascism is taking root and America no socialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people in the less they fascists every time someone do something they don't like right now but uh no no no I ... fascism it that is\nIt socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline we're all socialist now that's what sleeping is sweeping the nation are parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties oh that\nIs an understatement of the year can eat a lot of the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect to that is one way to describe yeah you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate but at an age on night late Nineteen thirties as today political rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies\nSparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism\nOr the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nUm I guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more hang on [noise]\nKnow radio at the office no problem you can stream I show alive at W.

I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against a all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up\nRioting and killing people okay good\nThen you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIt's essentially it was a an industrial workers at the\nWorld is by ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth through October twelve\nThat one's shut down San Francisco bay or the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit\nDown strike the battle of the overpass the republic steals strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots have communist and Marxist fingerprints on them\nI said it's it's a fundamental to the ideology right revel yesterday is fundamental to the ideology\nIt's been so unbelievably chaotic and yes a little more than Kroger I Am not mocking you for what you have to go through I Would just like to remind you that Martin Luther king went through a lot more\nAbraham Lincoln went through a lot more Abraham Lincoln if you don't think Abraham Lincoln as the man wanted to make that South hey\nIf you don't think he did you do know history if you think that our greatest founding fathers said\nExactly the same thing we do not want war we do not want bloodshed\nTake it take it take it until they couldn't take it anymore and they then wrote the declaration of independence which did not lead with why they were so mad instead they wrote up please me\nThis is who we are and will stand\nYou just seem to want to fight I Am not with you by look to win\n[noise]\nAll right [laughter] I Want to tell you about pro flowers if you need to send somebody in a sari nuts pro flowers I'm a one eight hundred flowers dot com if you need to send somebody uh flowers you need to apologize to somebody who you knew you screwed up with your\nWife for whatever send one\nEight hundred flowers dot com they have your back send the flowers right now they have a special that is happening right now if you use the ... code or back you're going to get a dozen red roses are multi colored roses for twenty nine Ninety nine but if you use the ... back they'll give you another doesn't so two dozen roses\nAbsolutely absolutely free the extra doesn't end the free glass vase go there and now one eight hundred flowers dot com it's one eight hundred flowers dot com use the promo code back [noise]\nBelieve in fairness just being fair\n\nI think you ...

interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and you know rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is dance response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel\nLike I Know you are a lot of\nUp outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here to Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when something that's where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about\nReligious liberty or around the world like for you\nYou know bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around\nThe world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture the whole\nSo tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandon their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged\nAnd they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a wry rarely ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats we observe new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated a outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to\nTalking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability\nThat we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people and reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user tight were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because it they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... if it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us and I think that's why\nA you know we'll find some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago\nAnd you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at\nThem yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group\nThat saying I'm going to stand for life not yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nAnd Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and and and gun for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is really important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game\nFor small just strategically new losing but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses in Jesus and\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling remodeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type [noise] back in just a second\nFirst let me tell you about gold lying a President Trump has been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress this November we will see an impeachment proceeding that does not mean that they will remove him from office but they will impeach him [noise]\nAh the ... the the first chance they get if they win the house if they win the house and the Senate you're going to see gridlock you're going to see nothing really nothing good\nWe need to go out and vote now what does this mean with Kay if chaos is happening in Washington more than it is\nWhat does that mean to the economy what does that mean to security one to our enemies do\nGold line has put together a report on what you can expect if there is a democratic victory you can get their report for free all you have to do is call them I've read the report I really would advise you to get it and share it with your friends\nI buy golden uh and silver as an insurance policy against chaos and if you've been paying any attention chaos is only getting worse\nHit your copy right now by calling eight six six gold line one eight six six gold line or gold lined dot com be informed of what our future may hold to get your free report now eight six six gold lie [noise]\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church you know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win\nBy by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him bracing them as a soul or a brother and sister not doing what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every front of me a name plate because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news I Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying the false prophet\nAnd so it's actually one of my staff made it into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way it's either wrap does he does either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of the members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what we can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us in the\nBook is filled with examples of Christians who actually built relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nUh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and state legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more\nWell he ended up getting to understand each other better the will the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically\nBecause at the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a link and I find go to the bio and it's the first thing to listen thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves\nOr you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate goes victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect the poor\nThe hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by\nThe name of the book is the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage make it a meat is well worth the read\nKnow radio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W. L. A. C. dot com\n[noise] ... this is talk radio in Ninety eight point three and Fifteen W ELL lazy [noise]\nI find that when the lights were on late at night last night at mercury one our mercury one partners are are are are ready to provide aid relief\nTo those who have are going to be affected it is now coming onshore alligator point Florida it is a monster a category for ...
