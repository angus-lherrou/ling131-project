I. lazy and now\nThese are born with the scale and my\nHow\nMore or suggestions for Elizabeth Warren as she tries to play her\nA Native American heritage despite a DNA test that shows that are just not true again she's having a complete meltdown after her uh suppose a DNA test revealed that she is something between a point one percent one point six percent\nOf um ... she says Native American heritage and yet you've kinda delved into the details that they don't even there isn't even any Native American heritage\nAnd well the the Stanford professor who took the a DNA data that not not the actual DNA sample\nAnd ... we don't have a chain of custody on that\nSo we don't even know if it really was her DNA but anyway so he he got a report from the DNA lab and uh he used this a new modeling system that he invented back in two thousand Thirteen that as far as I can tell us never really been used for this\nParticular purpose to identify the ancestry of as of any individual is used more for general populations but anyways Carlos Bustamante is a professor named\nUm and so he uh to to try to determine what Native American was he used a sample of other Native Americans except there is no Native American data he's he he says from the United states so he had to go to other quote native quote Americans who are from Peru and Mexico and Columbia\nNot not to be in politics or impolite or to specific but are you really a Native American if you're an indigenous person from Mexico Peru or South America it it's kind of like a few years ago there was a news report that\nUm I think Mandela had had died and and one of the one of the I'm a news commentators and announcing its\nThat you know referred to him as an African American I I'm Sorry he was South Africa and he was not an African American but they didn't want to call him a black person so again if they call these people in Peru and Mexico and South America Native Americans there is no American to it\nWell yeah and I remember ... specific claim was\nShe cleaner Cherokee now Delaware ... jerky yet pretty turkey and then when that kind of fell apart\nShe she claimed Delaware well I looked on the map where the these tribes were there were no Cherokee in Mexico Peru for Columbia no Delaware in Mexico prove or Columbia so\nThe Delaware we're in the area with that we now described as well Delaware\nAs the kids as the kids say nowadays\nIn October ... pulled [noise]\nGoing that program and we need to have our own lives in a war into how shall we need it wouldn't make that a oatmeal soup that she made and Taiwan found don't\nKnow I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because this is this is just outrageous don't you think yeah she\nReleased this big basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was a she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and part\nDelaware yes a which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second\nUh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won the ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report it says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve then they realized loops deep sea we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't want to do in the corruption but they pay they should have a cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one\nUh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself\nSo he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right but at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's\nA you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her was stupid to super recipes in Palau chat which is the goal of almost everybody\nPower and how much how how come out child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm going all fall I'm going all full I I'm I'm just I'm going to\nI just thought let's all complain about the names of out ball teams but what ... how ...\nFrom here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native American sense it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to the show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any\nDNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not getting participating in DNA studies we don't want any DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against\nWe have to use people from ... New Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood and it's not even what they tested\nOr and even that it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nSites like that not only did they say oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore\nHe was Canadian with DNA does is it shows a lineage against shows if it can be interesting in some way show migration patterns since I Wonder if he would it would have his\nBlood would show that he's a thousand times more Hispanic than\nA friend's disorder or it's true it probably would show that uh but so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relatives was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think\nA several generations back and um when she register who's in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and then this is true\nThat she would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother ... secondary early yeah but\nWhat have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I was not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying\nAs Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept legitimize what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so really I don't really care\nI don't care either but I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them\nAh [laughter] I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually took a horse\nA big a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet and he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and he took him and he\nPunched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this\nAnd he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go out and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah\nThis is what it was but it was the was it was not true how many advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls\nI was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told extra you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never lose you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's why I\nPeople are done with the identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it and the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump\nSaid I don't care I don't care\nI don't care what you say about me\nDon't care what you accused me of I don't care\nThat's why he won because he that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't walk this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else but they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we're going to get rid of capitalism gives it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers\nMan boy man or trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really great I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India\nShut up nobody cares\nWith all of this stuff that is going on in the world shut up\nThe issue here is you don't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activists who do believe all that craziness\nSo and there are so their stock they're hardwired incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh saying is white ... he's on TV with you know with the crazy crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate you're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go over\nTo the side of anti ... and say hey I don't think anybody is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination come back close enough to the center to where people are going\nOh she didn't really mean to shout the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean advise cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nHere\nYou've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campus is they don't like what's happening in the news\nThey may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not out shouting their abortion [noise]\nRadio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W.

I don't know the interest rate you could take five and it has everything right we're more\nSo the credit card bills roll into your mortgage yes they can and and your student loan and personal life\nIf I re fi does that mean I have to start out with another thirty your mortgage\nFor some reason they did at ... at American tiny thing we don't have to rethink Iran you can you can get cleaner Eighteen here and I don't think any time you need if you're working your way\nAre there any other benefits to refinancing your mortgage right now are you\nCan drop mortgages lower your interest rate it can take cash out kind of chemicals and at the base mortgage controlling the book how can I can make that happen\nCustom loans and significant savings if you're ready to take care of dead or maybe lower your current mortgage payment it is time to call American financing\nNever any upfront fees and you may be able to close and his fastest ten days get started now eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty that's eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty or American financing dot net American financing best service lowest rates fastest closings things than it's always a pleasure\nCall American financing now eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty that's eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty or go to American financing dot net in the mail is one two three three four regulated by the division of real estate [noise]\nThey found evidence of murder I'm Dave Anthony Fox News or Turkish officials LAPD it was discovered in Saudi\nConsulate in east anvil or Washington Post journalist Jamal quiz show he was presumed killed secretary of state Pompeo was in Saudi Arabia you met with the ... and\nStick around and the media is on their side you know\nSo it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and uh you know Portland has I don't know who this mayor is what I mean\nWhat the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away then they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super laughing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows entry for re chaos and then he can say sorry Trump's supporters are trouble\nI mean look at all the chaos it happens with someone who likes Trump shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are around so let's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh that's their sort of Monaco and it works\nIt's interesting because ... because the initial video seemed to indicate that your guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from ... throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least that the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nAnd it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative without doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes the five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days ... days in a domestic violence\nSo almost like I'm at I'm at a point now I think they don't just like empty but they aren't you ... I think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I ah I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have\nTried to be more moderating or on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick 'em when they're down in all of this stuff\nAre you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole a mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants soccer crossing just today said he can't go to restaurants and they own their own conservative\nGo to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist\nLike it it means absolutely nothing white supremacist as someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric\nView to have it's it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it sticks like glue and it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives\nThere's gotta be some culpability there\n[noise] okay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to own it take you over across the breaking and just\nAsk you what it is you believe what is the America that you see and that your fighting for [noise] back with Gavin begin is coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying\nIf you think this stuff is going away quickly it's not a if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress\nWe are in we're in for a real wild ride um they are going to subpoena the tax\nRecords and when they don't get the tax records from the White House the White House will bring it to the Supreme Court and then the uh Democrats will say the Supreme Court doesn't have the you know doesn't have a right to do this because of of ah\nAnd there's not a lot of places like that in the world it's it's very rare to have that\nTotal lack of class as a man that admiration for independence and liberty and hard work and we got there through a horrible list of ups and downs and\nAnd rights and wrongs and trying to correct things we had slavery or treatment of the Indians was not a but what's not what you'd expect for someone to whom the sermon on the ... mountains divine commanders as you can and says\nBut we ... we we got here altogether through all this mess and all this suffering and here we are in the ... country of the world\nAnd we get people complaining thing America was never great and and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get caught a white supremacist because the reason we love America is it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nAgain we had this for a long time I think the media basically just said antifa was a baby didn't exist they ignore them completely and as the violence has escalated their new tactic seems to be well yes there is violence but it is the Proud Boys fault or the right wing ... have you noticed\nOr they're just exercising I my favorite is they're just exercising their First Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of\nCourse of course I'm curious if you have if you detected a difference recently I'm In the approach from the media is trying to\nMake your group the real a village the real villain in this because I mean I I they were you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and it was retweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after this you be calm I think of central\nTarget in this is that do you feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that's the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying well we we are sick of albino violence might as well which is really\nWeird concept the evil Nazis and they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis now there are not so they go oh a link to expand the net here so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that has to stop and I unfortunately\nHave fallen into that that definition and it it's [laughter] it's amazing that anti ...\nAnd the media and the DNC are all in cahoots like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and you put it on dry dry grass and then the wind just takes it I think the matches antifa the wind is the media and against the are starting fires\n[noise] I don't I ... I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's you know when you're when you're into a ... organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start just going way off the rails and they're\nThey are they're they're the extremist party now\n... and it's it's getting so great I mean they used to and it the same as in Britain by the way the way that it the anti uses ... their paramount tally kept paramilitary wing here\nOr the media here's the jihad is over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend and then she first language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that now that said we're not still that's what Hillary's said\nWhen we go low or when they go low we kick them or Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no L. P. sure would ever go to their homes attack then we've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders ... harassed for the rest of her life that's alleged Denton it's at the same thing about Susan Collins\nThey're setting race in two Republicans if we've got Rand Paul's wife sleeping with the gun\nWe've got senator is getting that text to be having a trick cabinet comes in I mean can you tell the difference in all those stories between the so and the DNC they sound pretty similar to me\nGiven McGinnis thanks for other appreciate\nIt shares God Bless\nGavin McGinnis or from see our TV get off my lawn or [noise]\nThese are the conversations we should be having we should be looking inside and saying what is it I Believe what works what doesn't\nKnow radio at the office no problem you can stream I show live at W. L. A. C. dot com\nGo Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten ... [laughter]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to ... [noise]\nYou know in the in the book addicted outrage I [noise]\nI ... some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a surrendering or or just making friends with the left and it's not that's not what this is about at all\nIt's about knowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed and um and they're getting more and more\nDangerous and\nI have talked to you about Martin Luther king for a long time or or somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said a\nYear about a year to to a head I'm not sure um\nMaybe maybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe but it's not about\nIt's not about reuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in Washington I'm not talking about political people I'm Talking about your neighbors but the first thing we have to do is unite\nWith each other we have to unite to people people who are or on the right part of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together and I'm\nI'm really I I'm I don't like the hey you're on the train or you're not on the train what he's talking about what train where's the train going\nHere's the train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out\nIf you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out you can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates\nThat's America that's great that's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer\nAcross the board I'll bet you've eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean

because we still don't have any clarity on how will be a ...\nSo you don't know exactly what's coming he he\nGrew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and he has hinted in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government tea has he has called for in ... what are the Ninety nine a civil war um and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not\nHe's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least he has in the past correct\nAnd he's still around it by ... so a haze closest advisors today are a military so as an exception is a ... and that is appointed as he's minister of economy this guy is\nA liberal so we have several defenses regarding President Trump as you mentioned\nHe is he he's a liberal\nAnd he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man that he points that out\nAs a base of the trust in his government but\nUh he says he eh it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had laid out to a unauthorized them so\nUh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very close government regarding the press fake example he has been using social media as his basic communication tools [noise]\n... this is the kind of ... the same thing that you go job is said when he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately\nCame in and he started taking over the media and and the nationalizing every\nThe thing is the is there a ...\n... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is the military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect him most analysts are don't see any mediate\nA risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change\nIn constitution\nAnd it is not clear how he would do it he has a suggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution for Brazil and\nThat would be submitted to a vote or after eight so and in ... to to people to a electors in general so\nIt he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debate he is giving and just a few interviews and usually he ... the process has been speaking mainly through social media\nSo he has no confrontation from the press and this ah creates a an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic at right at the time ... because in the legislative elections\nHe got a a strong a performance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWould be the oil is changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nOr that ... son it ... and he posted online a while back a photo\nOf him and next to Bannon and said that Bannon as said he would\nBe glad to help in the campaign or something like this at this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but a boat so NATO himself a came to a public\nAfterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what\nWe know for a fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ... an expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's get a presidential candidates an\nA and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\n... Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth\nOr will have the final result it's very likely dead considering the current polls that bill sonata we'll be elected\nUh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave also NATO fifty nine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and I'm both an idle at poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to our ferry sure of their votes so eh we we would have to have a a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario button\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and find out uh some more will be followed a thank you so much for appreciated okay\nThank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history or he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and ah he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's a change demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in\nAs a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that is we should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobble together this a populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames and uh what are they what ... what will you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm In the rest of the world\nThe the believe it or not softness and a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist\nAre sponsored this half hour is simply safe simply safe is the way to guard your home to watch over you and your family and it's the craftsmanship\nThe craftsmanship that actually helps um a simply safe beat out

it in the new rental home and you don't have to pay for it again you have to deal with all these new fees for two Ninety nine a month and when you don't have it you're building a family is is this is

Saudis came landed a jet on the tarmac\nCame with a bunch of empty suitcases and bones saw chopped him up and put them in the suitcases took him out of the embassy put them on a plane and he's\nProbably scattered over some desert in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia said that's out land dish that's crazy yadda yadda the Turks went in ah apparently there was a massive cleaning crew that went in right before the Turks could go in and investigate\nAh the some more things were leaked by the FBI or sorry about the CIA et cetera and are now our secretary of state is over with the king of Saudi Arabia and it looks as though they are going to admit\nThat yes they did kill them a but it was an interrogation that just went horribly wrong and we're going to punish all the people that were involved\nIn this so now they're twenty four episode oh it's it's crazy now that this is I mean this is honestly rear window Alfred Hitchcock this exactly Alfred Hitchcock with somebody sitting sitting outside\nGoing wait I I I think they shop her up in that case it's a woman I think they've chopped are up and then took her away in the middle of the night and it was like no that's crazy ... well it turns out it was and\nUh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they've chopped them up and took a mountain suitcases that it is the Hitchcock\nRear window and this is obviously gone very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later\nLike this is something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time they're constantly killing journalist and they're like I don't even know who I don't even know that was what is ... ... am I've never even heard of the thing and you know like that that their pattern and they never admitted if Saudi Arabia actually comes out in the mid ... yeah\nWe kind of killed that journalists that's a big moment\nOr in you know geopolitics that's not a it's not a tiny thing today\nOr how today or tomorrow the way the president answers Saudi Arabia when\nWhen they admit to doing this this is an ally a this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east they stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel\nUm we're in a proxy war in Yemen with that most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen\nAt their request and they're fighting with us um they keep Iran at bay we're about\nTo sell them a whole load of arms they also dump money into our tech industry ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system are upset\nThat cool or herb that what we should say that's a pretty sweet shore okay the or predict just do we know that they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident notice how the orbit is\nA show she stuffed inside of it [laughter] stuff it inside of me how they ... they hide so\nUm what is the president do what do we do this why you don't get involved in these things because it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did what he don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different but I couldn't help me quantify the difference here for a minute\nThese regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not an innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on in foreign territory in an embassy is it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue\nCan get it can go after a cushion her and and and Trump because of the relationship what ... what do you think\nI say yes and all of that I'd say yes to all of that um I don't think if this guy was a preacher\nNobody would have been paying attention rather did we got one back and no one yeah nobody seemed to care of this one because it's one of there's\nA the press cares more about it but also foreign soil and you know\nThe suitcase thing it's a pretty amazing story\nNo radio at the office no

I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then I remember\nThere was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here is that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Nashville", "day": "16"}
