I personally witness not somebody told me she did it so he's affirmatively saying I saw it with my eyes spy with my little eyes his own eyes he's a witness to it\nI witnessed Dr Ford help\nHer lifelong friend Monica el McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect\nHow polygraphs worked and help McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam Dr Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology and quote\nNow do you think the FBI his rushed over to interview Dr McLean do you think that the Senate counsel\nFor the district committee of rushed over to interview Dr McLean or or ... McLean to find out did\nDr Ford prep her for her polygraph test\nMaybe as a side issue because if she did get hired in an intelligence capacity in the U.S government is she's still in that capacity and did she cheat the polygraph thanks to the tips that were offered to her by\nDr Ford she might need to be losing her job and if we find out that she may be lied to get her job maybe we need to pursue some criminal actions against her but at the very least it is time to pursue some criminal actions for investigation of perjury by Dr for not only her fear of flying\nBut but perhaps her lying about this uh this business of never having prepared somebody for a polygraph never I never did that ever never did that\nAnother thing to look at would be her attorneys are basically left wing attorneys who are very closely associated with George Soros groups are investigating them for supporting perjury\nYou pointed out earlier today that that the the attorney client privilege can be waived by the client gave me way by the law firm ... can't say oh you know we're going to waive attorney client privilege and tell you what we told her\nShe can waited and reveal what the lawyers told her how they instructed or how they prepared her how they possibly ... perjury by prepping her to say things that they knew or should have known simply were not true same thing applies to sweat Nick

like\nThis have you ever had discussions with anyone um besides your attorneys on how to take a polygraph never never and I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or

somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else about a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important to keep it any better she now that you moved accused she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standards of the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should

real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things digital goods are especially digital books movies music they go into this transaction assuming they work the same way

they were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted\nBooks off of people's candles and including\nA ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four so these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to really a sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nUh and I read so much I read it all on tend to but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because he watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China and the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concern or from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history\nIf these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands\nOf you know the the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to um to to uh to archive and preserved um these works\nIn an air and it with the movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo al how are you [noise] um oh my\nGosh so they almost force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's a masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and uh you know fully restored but you still had the old copy\nNow that's right you can't ... I mean even ... I mean think of this even just for comparison you can if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that once you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own sort of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm\nWith the Apple TV for example at the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their ... servers exactly I'm Sorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship if those\nIf I downloaded a something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nSo they can handle allows you to store those files locally on your own device but cars that Kendall is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon\nAmazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago\nTo block it move those files strong Muslim Abul ... you're talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a YouTube album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way they've forced everybody to have it exactly\nBizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\n... it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk of but a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an errand before you answer that we're going to take a quick\nBreak and then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and that just the change\nCapitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor years now relief factor has been helping uh my team\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh ...\nWell I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's really good [laughter] I'm married and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you could I don't think he can focus on and tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver\nUm there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's gonna happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean\nThere if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this\nThis bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and are you going to have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also do it in gold and it's all made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold line\nJust look at the numbers find out for yourself is the world hurtling towards\nA fiscal sanity or insanity\nAcross many for the sounds fascinating how ... how many have from talk radio Ninety three and Fifteen tend to have a state with your time saver try this report\nIs sponsored by T.

and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to when plants anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word\nAnd he and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes sheets he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kevin ... and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seem that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it's secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring their results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's a real problem\nYou're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because that's occurring real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way have fake news doesn't\nReally convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake\nNews add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted different wet I wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right\nWhy will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back\nDo you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes and it's not

player there find out more about the budget lines commitment that giving back\nHashtags budget lines can each franchise independently owned and operated ask but the town\nIn Franklin foot to switch from a um [noise]\n... this is talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W LA scene\nGlenn Beck Taliban leaders wiser is with us a president of government accountability Institute producer of a new documentary that is out and you find it at the creepy\nLine dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google\nYou know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to de platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back and first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and size that Google ... wait a minute how if if the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use the mail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith an acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is\nGolf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states\nUse Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert apps signed this caller who has been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um ran a did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece um about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on general a gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being that have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think\nThey are analyzing all of it look there's that this is just the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay\nThe center is the main city of aging how many people that you just look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy picked somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide guy [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of the guy and said find him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
