Washington student denied having sexually assaulted his accuser quote I was investigated by my school's office and found that there was insufficient evidence of what she was accusing me up\nNow why would why would that matter we have to believe the witness yes\nI mean they did an investigation and they couldn't find enough evidence but is that really\nWhat we care about what about the poor

people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working\nUh you know even even when I listen to their their favorite commentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are ... are headed out when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and\nAnd what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of that now we've not done with for national elections involving you know a more than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again if I favoring one candidate\nYou can shift in a country like ours millions of votes where there's no one having this latest idea that they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou that is scary\nIt is you you um you lay this out in the in the creepy line I'm about how Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and\nWithout an agenda [noise] um and then ah ... how they have\n... you know the ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this at a national study in the last almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search results are those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know\nAnd is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior world wide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use ah ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and without leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results not like a news story\nThat just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays a in\nWorld War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two\nThat this is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda [noise]\n[noise] oh\nAnd this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA\nThat's just one of ten ways\nUh that I've identified over the years and then I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they are I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd then I read years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging\nIn this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret uh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using\nThe Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results\nNow that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think they all to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nA that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glenn\nBut I Am I travel [laughter] ...\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm who's there with ...

hour really really really well\nReally get [noise]\nYou know this is something that I've been talking about for years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said someday it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there\nI've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour\nWhy did that affect you so much um\nCouple of things uh one I think like we all ... there's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do\nUm you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true in a lot of case um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing that this is you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they bought into the result is is like a\nLot as a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real\nDeal with some real credibility again comes it comes from the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to as he describes Hillary voter\nRight right um but beyond that uh ... seems incredibly hopeless\nTo me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people had to persuade people to look at the world and ex slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to an might wind myself from Google\nI honestly have no idea how I Would do that and I'm In\nI'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go to Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance apparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do is is the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know a search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used it's it's better than a you know I'm ... I mean you know as you get into deep stuffing you but I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about the someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nAnd when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using and I went to ... go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on grown\nSo now I got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't I\nCan't come up with enough personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like\nThat what did he say three hundred million word\nYet documentary million words reunion is like a ... of of\nData on you\nAnd that ... million pages pages of data and again like but I I don't know\nWhat is the personal cost to me in that data\nWell there's several things there are some things that could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent go the way that Google wants them to go that's in that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that\nIt is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to\nThe problem is not today this is not today it's just technology\nIs now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth\nIn ways that we will not be able to understand I mean\nAs the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use it you said when you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak\nOh yeah but I mean and fail in their right right\nIt's it's it I mean it ... you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years\nAnd he's a he's a Clinton supporter\nOr is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it back that up yeah and that's that was terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events I could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe ... right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google receive a row search results are returning things favorable\nTo Hillary Clinton is not some wild crazy theory it's something that's already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really act ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and that this stuff escalates they're gonna feel justified to take more overt action and got only knows where that ends up I I ... I mean it could go in really bad directions\n[noise] this is um uh\nWe we are entering a ten year period now where our lives you really will not recognize your country the world or our lives by twenty thirty you just will not\nIf you when you see the rage on the faces of the leaders of of the left and the Democrats and they're saying we have to get more radical remember you're already talking about a group of people that believe the ends justify the means\nYou're already talking about a group of people and let's make sure we're not like this a group of people\n... this is talk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W ELL easy\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] and then how do the left and the New York times and the media don't seem to really have a problem with this or the left believes they need to become more radical uh and they need to turn things up a notch\nNow I don't know how you do that\nI mean now I did recommend\nYou know ... I guess they could start using ... I Do like the old uh you know ... take the leadership roles women carpets and then\nJust have horses trample them but that might hurt a horse you know in the left would not want to do that you know you I guess you could get a smart car or you know a Chevy Volt\nBut and set on fire and then you'd die screaming or could be a win win there anyway um oh my gosh did you just threaten yeah what are we talking about here\nHow do you turn this up pat how do you turn this off without violence\nI think the only ... level up is revolution isn't it that's about the only thing they haven't done so far there screaming and people's faces a they're showing up at restaurants in department stores and everywhere Mexican waters told them to their homes their clawing at the door of the U.S Supreme Court it's\nThreatening online yeah they're they're scaring people they're charging them with with crimes they didn't commit I mean I think we're all pretty sure he's not a gamer gang rape is right now I'm pretty sure I don't even ... yeah I mean you know there were five\nPeople five people only one charge was Ford Ford was one the other for ... they weren't real now why do we say well no woman would do that well I Know you've got four people over here who did ... multiple\nHuge stories of fake accusations of sexual assault that have happened over the past few months so this happens all the time because women are people right we're going to people in order to bad things just like men do bad things stink\nStory ah I think it was in California of a high school kid and I was accused by these high school girls they called them demean girls yeah it was in the same city where are the movie supposedly took place um and so these girls all got together because they didn't like this guy and decided to accused him of sexual assault\nHe went through all kinds of hell over it\nAnd uh after six months for a year they finally admitted nano we made that up why\n'cause we didn't like to listen to him and I like to look at him\n... oh Mm wow amazing\nSo did you hear the credible stuff did you hear make them scared the ... make them scared know does he was from the University of Washington\nA and a\nA it's a website where you can just um you know put your allegation out about how you been raped or whatever you just include that person's name you know where they are what class cetera et cetera and just we're going to make them scared\nWow yeah my university students on the university Washington campus\nUh I mean what what else\nWhat else I mean this is the world the left is is increasingly embracing mhm legitimizing and calling for\n... and what are the the normal\nCivilized way to escalate a situation when you're not getting what you want right you can do things like you could escalate your language it's hard to escalate patch gang rape accusations it's kinda hard to go past that with your language I guess you gotta murdering genocide as a couple of other things I guess you could accuse U.S Supreme court justice opt get your way uh then you have a like a\nThey already they already say the United states is a genocidal carry right I mean there's there's no way you can increase the language against America were men so then you can go to structural\nOr procedural type of things but I mean look what they did here they they pulled out every stop they tried to get a they'd delayed until late in delayed they try to get an FBI investigation that and they said that wasn't enough and we're seven at the end he said seven FBI back riding with no\nEvidence at all of these zero thousands and thousands of people show up screaming we believe we we believe the survivor well\nSurvivor of what why I mean until it's confirmed she's not a survivor right like I mean at least to us she may if something happened to her and she's telling the truth like having a yes she's a survivor to herself but as a society we have to judge it based on the facts\nRight and I own it condemns her I don't wish ill towards her nothing nothing I don't know I wasn't there but we don't destroy either life there's got\nTo be some evidence against the guy it's not up to him to prove he didn't do it no\nThat doesn't know they don't need evidence can we play the audio of this is me I uh [noise] this is me half listening somebody said to me Glen you don't want to do this interview blah blah blah and I heard London I thought I heard the b._b._c. and I was like oh yeah 'cause I thought they would be", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Nashville", "day": "08"}
