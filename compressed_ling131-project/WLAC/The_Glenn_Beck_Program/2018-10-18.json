Jeremy Hollywood madam highly flies former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and others\nAre he passed away he is still expected to win his race um and if he does win than the county officials will nominated other Republican to fill the\nFill the vacancy so I guess a lot of Republicans will vote for him to make sure that the state stays in Republican hands but yeah it'd be humiliating\nTo lose ... to it that guy or at least that's what the polls are showing speaking of polls a Vanderbilt University which has a great track record of ah not incredibly wrong here\nYes incredibly wrong they they didn't think two weeks out before the two thousand sixteen presidential didn't they say Hillary Clinton had a shot\nI think I think she had a shot at Tennessee and of course during to Vanderbilt poll one by one twenty six\nPoints yeah and then in two thousand fourteen they did a poll of the Republican primary and said Lamar Alexander would be Dzhokhar by forty point and what was the final result they're\nA Lamar got less than fifty percent and beat Joe by nine points a little bit off a little bit off you know if if you're in the political consulting business and and you realize that the guy or or lady that his consulting your opponent is a Vanderbilt University political science grad start high five\nBut I mean you've gotta you've got the easy path to exactly the opposite lengthening on metal Tennessee State university when you look at the professors that are teaching politics that empty su at Vanderbilt please let me run races against those guys so everyone is is Vanderbilt polls show in the U.S Senate race in\n... so it shows a she was ... up by one which is exactly the opposite of the most recent New York times upshot Sienna college poll which shows Marcia up by fourteen now we looked into the numbers a little bit and I know this will shock you but there are problems with this poll\nGarbage in garbage out as we've told you before you know at this stage of the game if you're pulling anything other than likely voters or very likely voters based on what people tell you 'cause everybody says oh yeah I vote all the time and then you look at their voting record and they felt like you know never or aren't even registered to vote\nI meant to ask you what you were doing last Thursday and instead you're helping with the phones saw it does happen Darnah slipped many times\nI've fallen with my bones saw and saw up someone into tiny little pieces and put them into cases it's happened to me over and over again fifty times in the last three weeks oh wow I'm estimating well it'd be sixty can be twenty\nOh you don't keep track of every single time something like that happened to me why not I mean that will just is why I subscribe to a suitcase deliveries [laughter] dropped off you know a few dozen a day because you know you never know hearts in a suitcase then deliver it to a private plane up maybe on\nThe bad guy here okay maybe on the bad guy I happen to run around a lot with my bones thought okay\nMake sure bad guy I don't think I I don't think it does occasionally mall bond one or two individuals your mom probably suggest stew don't be running around the house or the bones saw you know she did someone's eye out she also said donate sugary cereal and I do that now do\nYou know we we are all up we get responsibility for our lives and you start making decisions as an adult in my decision is I'm going to carry my bones all round and again\nAnd occasionally my ... is it isn't so severe SUNY system right right exactly yeah at least I'm ... I'm going through the right steps of the cutting them up into little pieces and put 'em in this case and then I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards and it's interesting\nToo that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter I ... I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington\nPost columnist was an error he's written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them and people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now\nBut if you're in it and I live in the first one the biggest a political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty you're going to go all out of it and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and it was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about\nWell they been our allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a friendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always\nAlways accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Obama was plenty friendly with them to exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would have done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point now under and it wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the\nMedia coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is expensive right remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school\nWhen he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the room remember the ... and ... they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who ... who was who was incompetent Brock Obama waited what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision five hundred years or so what are the me there was a decision you made since ... Charlotte me to go get worse criminal on earth ah what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one to kill the guy\nRight you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking a mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker and it was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally if for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not\nBeing reactionary with Trump it that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... or Donald Trump but the CNN I think they made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport in and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your bones ... something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incident\nAnd what happened there were still in that age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them because they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kinda I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based\nOn you know what the media wants you to do\nRight like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day if of American interests are harmed long term I'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority for top priority is not a Jew ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the you know I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to talk to start creating more such studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this\nGuy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it and they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nI I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen why why did that happen\n'cause it's even less explode couple right the\nHere you have a situation where it is the name it's spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that Osama went to summer they\nShouldn't get a letter [laughter] they just said no it's not a no it's a new if the you know the guy went from like mid range pick in ... last pick I [laughter] like ... when this happened ... the guy is dead\nAnd no one ever landed he now no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it shouldn't be Usama Osama\nWhy no no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange it's it is very strange uh it and like some of it I I guess they understand like for example are here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco right ... ... if you're over there they call it ...\nAnd ... everyone calls it Morocco now I've never heard that I was ... here's another one here we say Mazda for the car mhm if you listen uh as as a as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they say Matt ...\nIt's mad stuff Toronto that's really irritating I wouldn't get into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off at the end hasta yeah they'll call us ... that were not as\nWe are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you are you are on the commercial on a\nJaguar what it's like they like if you come up with a name on your own\nMaybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what is the word we already know and when I say you were a hundred years it stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to right every citizen jak you are\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that see I think that's jak you are trying to seem refined right like it was like um there's something a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... er jaguars like as the that that stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog\nAnd then this Yankee water [laughter] would you be gone\nOver there right but it turned into my dog had terrible I'd but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it though everything's going to be okay [laughter]\nThat happen you know this three times last week alone for me and it was fifty some for you all over the last three weeks okay oh no

somewhere rank and he's just a you know because we such a physical specimen ... he likes to challenge himself so that's what he's\nYeah I Know that he's doing today he he claims he's not going to finish it any better than third but I I don't know I had a great chance of winning the ... do you have some very modest [laughter] so we'll see how that turns out looking for the update swimming get them\nOr we need to warn you about something that's incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses that there is some danger there Karen nightly\nIs promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the Fort realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ... from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her and she says don't rescue yourself obviously\nAnd this is the one I'm but she ... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self yes\nShouldn't ... out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man\nA amen thank you mhm there's a lot of women are doing that today the main message modeled on a ... of really the entire movie a is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy\nThat's the message you should be taking from those movies I'm Kristen Bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes [laughter]\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she read Snow White del taco bell yes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I looked at my girls and ask\nDon't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like\nOkay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it a\nWhile you nailed that when they're dead wrist and then she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her\nPermission well no because she's in a coma mom [laughter]\nCan't give her permission and she'll stay in a coma if he doesn't cancer\nRight I mean she's advocating for the government could continue right the kids are out of it\nRight and bell says or because you can't catch someone if they're sleeping\nOn different I mean in my circumstances that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book right the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there is a magical apple\nThere's a a a print or with a magical spell right on the princess yeah and she's sleeping because she can't wake up unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise\nThat yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that price your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself so worked up about the you know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did this\n[laughter] they just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I can understand if you know sometimes I think even you know ... like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things\nAre like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon because we're watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I Know it was a captain planet or whatever and all of that that is that actually that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is a ... yeah you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this one we might have been a pig or something\nIt's usually type of pick out like type of pick a lot a and a pet but it was talking about you know recycling or ...\nOr even my first iPhone you're experiencing a game changer

lead you don't all full roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly\nYeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no core operation there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago\nAnd yet uh\nI just saw an article today about from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice from office there are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know while first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't care he occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest eight Brett Kavanaugh but I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court because they thought they had a chance of winning\nOr the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court would that was one hundred percent of of it for every for every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which\nYou could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we\nDon't know um but the other people and Cory Booker did not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nThen again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different\n... let me put this than I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was ... and ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they were a member of the ...\nIncident uh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what did they have as much of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named instead\nCame out that yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like you know very distant and I didn't know what was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that\nI think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction ... I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person saying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who\nEven knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of light talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton Broderick initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rip off to advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to take down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against her\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after\nIt occurred uh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovated so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked a rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window\nWow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after\nThey never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes wrong is still makes a big levels speeches\nOh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with\nActual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that is the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kangaroo court and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard\nThat can sanity it's insanity and yet you have\nHillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two when she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some Pancho evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated or exception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy fair so pissed off about that\nAnd they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point but what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the\n...

L. A. C. dot com\nDave Ramsey weekday afternoon from five ... on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W well ac [noise]\nGlad that helping him with patents do triple eight Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes I Am part of this saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something\nThat against you know motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure and himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah the power to make you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian\nHe's in ... he wields incredible power in this country now incredibly led to ever fired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation\nAnd I got to go back to what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\nWas this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the sense of the allegation that he didn't do it in force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that cost\nStation he learned to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault why the accusation there are no matter what show which she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that ... it's unbelievable there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nA make it easier well he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think\nThat the one I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible\nBut that is that enough for a crime snow act that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it wouldn't even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just a Seattle and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it does affect or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while 'cause that are loose the gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he espoused raunchy several clubs around New York since and they let them under the age so the New York times of exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner about why you let him on stage\nIs a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nListen all the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work and he's like\nNever might never it's never\nToo well can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never missed ... minutes late provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say particularly to a female customer who was somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nThose have all had huge play in the media the I mean what's the percentage Ninety five percent have been on the left\n... it's all Hollywood and news media people and I mean it's been almost everyone has been in those industries and those industries obviously lead incredibly to the left\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like the people who are on the right pay the price for it or people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point where\nSomeone like Louis decay who was I think are accused ... correctly of being a dirt bag right she was ... to his own admission\nBut not not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least it's not as reported you know you have to look at these\nThings as they say it I mean is even sorry he's not doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr Glenn or what the heck is his name I don't get it wrong frustrate you used a of a of harassing a young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work we have this weird saying why I mean Mike Tyson\nIs pretty clear the man was convicted of rape not a lot of time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling of the media he comes out of you guys the silly appearances everywhere have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he I mean I'm lucky surf time and he's out right\nUm and so you can make the case as the left has made forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote you should be their programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accuse if he is yeah it really doesn't make any sense ... seven twenty seven back is the phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nUh is traverse ing currently uh the Mediterranean Sea\nIn a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is a week or so but he's doing it alone alone which is\nAmazing just amazing I I don't know if there's a Web I'd heard that there would be some ah there'd be a boat going next to him with a Web cam she could see all the action but\nUh no I think ... came to the canoe and and it's just it's just that was just him canoeing across the Mediterranean Sea\nWow you know the water for most you'd like to go pro because it would have to be waterproof but yes it's a long long journey we think he's back Monday but we're not entirely ... when he's\nDone with the Mediterranean Sea he's got a canoe back so we're hoping to get special either [laughter] happy it really fast

their preparedness specialist can help you make the right choice for you\nWell do you how did he lie what do you lie about he said he drink to excess from time to time yep\nWhat are you lie about the idea is that we're all other because other people around them are like well I think he he people did blackout how the hell do you know not only he would know that right ah you know maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that ah\nThere's no way to know that into the conversation but still there's no way to know what it's a ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the\nSubtle accusation that everyone who supported\nBrett Kavanaugh was a terrible person even from people like you know there are people in the left that you know I'm sure as I say I certainly know them\nAnd they were against Kavanaugh because they believed or you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they are saying which is they accuse us of believing\nForward\nA roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want\nOn the Supreme Court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is ...\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible\nI didn't I didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened\nYeah I don't either and they haven't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that is is this is a\nI don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official or in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades\nThen talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like water we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt\nUh dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march that women's march rallies as as an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicate that this this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the events occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't leave I\nEver they survived this assault by this man maybe if they've assault didn't happened they didn't survive it and [laughter] yeah I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us in our life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one ...\nPossibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nWhether they should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk\nAbout uh yeah I Know\nWe talk about the the ... were women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so\nVital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle and receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful\nThey do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with some of my people are writing a with swastikas on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother to write any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ...\nAnd no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusation we're littered all over the store\nThe only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats\nWere the first to and and in the second one is is that there's a ... they're right when they the person who made the allegation said I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I\nBut I couldn't locate them All right well I I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly the failed to act on sounding corroborating evidence on that one either and there and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they weren't there are those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people like have it on his uh his or what we're saying no\nUm but that one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and\nDoing it relatively credible job recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation\nSomeone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with\nHillary Clinton she said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this\nLike in the media access if it's entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter] don't of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you brought up to high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk and I like to look at him I just don't like him\nThat's why they accused him the credits didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her L G peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a shoe you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you F ing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do you ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself ...\nOr the woman and why would you do that yeah why what could her motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett Kavanaugh\nOr the a woman in Texas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the camera footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing this case we didn't know about this at the time or the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping\n... a people and that was also found to be completely false\nAnd untrue or ah how about the racist receipt we don't tip of terrorists to an Arab a person at a restaurant um who again later on I had to admit that yes he actually wrote the stuff on the receipt wow or the former college student who claimed rape and then in ...\nAging exercise and everyday living\nLet me ask you are
