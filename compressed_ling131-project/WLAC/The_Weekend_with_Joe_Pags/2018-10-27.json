yeah when it comes to that as a ... no no wait a minute I can get that [noise] so [noise] no no it only works if we if we all are like no I'm really going to do it\nI really got to do when it affects me I'm going to do it that's when that's when it comes from Larry sharp candidate for governor of New York ...\nTalk radio da da and Fifteen ten W ...\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty percent and trading was about two thousand dollars going ... from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but she was right\nLegacy disgusting media reporting that it's the Naga bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no\nNot the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him the smog bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter advocating rational baseball game the Sanders shooter\nEven though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that\nWe don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\n\nAnd also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American his first name as Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well as all sort of reports that he's a talent in Filipino\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman\nThe guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to us right as I can\nAnd that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like at some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country\nI mean just the ... the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media sends out a bunch\nOf alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but it sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we put return addresses armies wouldn't fake addresses on the actual sent into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this\nAnd I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that in fact I can make a good argument that the media\nIs inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist than Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou'll late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for a pollutant that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later and there are\nThere is an example of for example at resemble Yvette with the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma concept from CNN the other day\nTweeted out this appointment or anxious over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind\nThis is the guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that\nHe's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are those your\nPerpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut this is elected reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is if it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's they're responsible or by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the leftist trying to glean from him and pin it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not drug or observing and tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews\nOut of their ashes hold this guy in Florida game of van with a bunch of crap on it and had them send out what would those who think it's a false flag would call a fake bombs\nThe reason why I'm successful other than it's a damn good show is that when I talk news and when I report the news to you and when we break down topics I always base it on fact if you base it on the fact you're always going to be safe\nIf you start speculating I can probably take calls for three hours would you guys telling me what you think happened when it comes to the alleged bomber\nOut of I Can't play that game so that we go on facts what do we know we know that he called himself a a a self a couple of different names first name always Caesar\nWas either ... or was out theory or whatever we know that the guy had some ... a bunch of weird stickers on it we know that he's got an extensive criminal record we know that he was a Democrat until twenty sixteen when he allegedly switched to Republican\nWe know that he's a wannabe bodybuilder we know that his family says that he's delusional we know that he's presented himself as an American Indian I'm a seminal to be exact\nIn South Florida what we know these things we know that also his allegedly who's the lawyer for his family I couldn't verify that was his lawyer but I'm was on NPR or something saying that he was actually Phillies actually Filipino and Italian who knows I don't know what I Do know\nHe used the FBI says these were real devices [noise]\nThe FBI says yes [noise]\nThey weren't really we're not a hoax they could have detonated thank goodness they didn't [noise]\nI Can't go on what you say I have to go with the facts are the FBI says that's what it is unless you're telling me of the FBI was in cahoots\nWith the false flag that where they found this guy out of their butts and just say hey look here's the guy let's change the election\nI Can't play that game it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com they're under\nThe weekend with a yellow palm\nListed on your

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with the illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way\nAnd and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to or has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate gel are you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nIllicit always appreciate it really had a good time with your at the fair get together in Washington DC got some great knowledge I have\nTo wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six want to do for his standing next to you but ah it it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw you out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nGo walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't steak I've seen some go I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to two I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm going to see in the store and these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his wedding it's gone on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect and we've tried to go in there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that\nUnions can attract more slide and then you can then they're saying\nAnd and watching you interact that again the sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking of very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you think is there a percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand that you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police ... is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is promote police officers I mean for me it probably about ... percent of those\nAre difficult to deal yeah ... yeah you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness power if you walk out your calm and they can steal that they don't steal your wrapped up in your it really\nHelps that situation go a lot smoother image you have to read it ended up going to last but there's some people that have just like you said from the word do they're not with\nAnd or you can tell that immediately\nBut what I've learned from watching your sheriff mark ...
