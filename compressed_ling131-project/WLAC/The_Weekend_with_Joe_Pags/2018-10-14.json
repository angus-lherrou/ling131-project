dot com [noise] all the goods there we have redesigning the website Go check it out also\nThe blaze radio network it is the weekend with Joe ... we're always glad to catch up with my former governor the go former governors great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary\nThe states of America no and you might wonder well what does that person do a lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about bad we talked about liquefied natural gas are we going to end wars well ah Wrigley always appreciate you how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much where I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know taxes but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globetrotters now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back\nHome base it on your back over Indonesia we do know that that was going to entail all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution a renaissance that's occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent as groups and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process to smooth and has a\nUh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the ... a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has in and he's putting it on me you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining he's ... he's putting terms is going to ruin trade\nAnd in no time slabs biggie you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade or in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the deal how does that go down\nThere he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause the secretary of treasury nutrition and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a\nA a role to play in that and\nAnd uh so I absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team\nI Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] true true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his\nTheory here is that listen if I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes with some really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young kid and came back in here or after they laid out some really tough ah a sanction or not sanctions but ... ...\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and\nLet's let's find a way so did the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the tariffs are originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later the Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese no they'll lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customer they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRight out of the ... yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently\nAnd our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to a source of the issue when you finally got\nTo see what these trade deals were especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things were outdated you know think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as rent side\nI was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean\nCompletely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions then we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what\nIt's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U.

extremely trusting\nAs human beings well I'm going to go to your website and I'm going to be safe from and it's\nA ... and re save not obvious\nIn fact we keep hearing about the breaches an over you're doing something about to protect yourself\n\nThe headline from NBC News so it could be fake news NBC News the same outlet that his pretending to president is holding Roberts Lee up on high while ignoring the fact that he talked um globally about Ulysses Grant beating ...\nBut it fits their narrative better to protect you only said the part about lead\nSo NBC News fake news NBC says Facebook says hackers so personal info oh forty million people being exposed data including relationship status birth date hometown education and the ... most recent searches Facebook's it\nDavid Ingram wrote us\nFacebook said on friday that hackers were able to access to personal information of forty million people through security love company first disclosed last month and other data exposed included information such as raising chickens\nAnd searches so if you're not connected with me but you were able to hack into my account you know where I Am you know what I'm looking up in other words I have no privacy of his website it all\nTo the story Facebook sending a blog post that people would be able to check whether they were affected by the fact by visiting your Facebook help center on line the company also said that in the coming days it would send customized messages to users to explain what information might have been access\nTo social networking company disclosed two weeks ago that a security flaw in Facebook's view as\nFeature had allowed ... into the potentially into and potentially take over people's profiles Facebook the world's largest social media network of more than two billion users has faced rising criticism but it's failed to protect people's privacy they disclosed this year that personal information of up to eighty seven million people\nWas taken by the maker of a quiz\nAnd then wrongly handed over to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Facebook did not say who might have been behind the leaves the jak or certain groups of people were targeted but it said it was working with the forties including the FBI to investigate\nThinking about that you truly go to one of these Web sites and it's all Facebook is a freaking website some do first made up a website and college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on\nCampus though Facebook is what they started getting rid of a ... minute Facebook\nThat you know blossomed into well yeah everybody wants to go meet hot guys and girls sure\nWhat the hell are you sure picture to it or was it was going to be able to connect to that and then it became a very powerful outlet it used to be that if you if you follow somebody you solve their stuff every time they followed us all your stuff every time then they started employing something they call an algorithm\n... to make up a term obviously algorithms run around but\nThey've got an algorithm that actually says are you know what you're looking at I Know would advertise you clicked on I Know who you most respond to therefore I'm going to use this algorithm by what I Know about your habits are my website I'm going to say what I think you want to see\nThe ... do I'm going to not say enjoy what I don't want you to see and then it's I'm only going to do the stuff we want you to see\nAnd now that we're floating around in a website that were started in trying to find hot chicks on campus now we have no idea where the where we have any privacy at all\nI mean it's logical rational to think I've connected with\nMartin on Facebook I should be able to see Martin stuff if you took the connection if I'm not connected to him I shouldn't be able to see his stuff maybe as profile picture of your lets me maybe the fact that he has a profile but it's fine but whatever he doesn't want me to see I shouldn't see\nThese hackers were able to go on there and see everything\nEverything and in some instances wouldn't even know how many really very able to take over the actual social media presence that's next to me man that's crazy\nAnd still be stories reported so infrequently we\nHave no idea what people are doing on Facebook or Twitter with our stuff we found out not long ago from project very to Austin James O'Keefe that Twitter actually has mushy language that will silence you if they don't like what you say\nOr they will read all of your direct messages because they feel like it and it's like a whole a whole lotta nothing we can do about it it's so weird to me it just makes me a less trusting person what\nWebsite can attract trust mind [noise] to trust the radio station Web sites with social media [noise] it turns out our greatest fears are alive and well we're going to somebody else's website we're giving them all of our personal information and guess what\nMany times they mishandled the wild newsflash right\nQuick break we're back after this weekend was Joe packs there [noise]\nThere is the weekend with a ... pound [noise]\n\nAnd I hard radio and listen on your blackberry or\nOr I can download the ... now I don't ... the\nMessage and to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nA Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin once that he is out there instead of the Feinstein teams saying let's get you some help and let's get a psychiatry psychologist to talk you through his figure out what happened she instead says here's the far left wing resist lawyer and this lady Deborah cats go and talk to her I mean I don't think that's the right move either where are you on that\nNo I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd her Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are we supposed to work she want to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson wrestle your last question on Kavanaugh known them onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and\nThe left is screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him I mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick them off the court 'cause we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and ... they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams since the day after the election when the wrong person corner them one\n... I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some you know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task growing hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous insecure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery from day one\nIn the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett would correct you supported the president has it all Republicans and as good old Americans because their paychecks are bigger and\nAnd do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help the people of the major amount of people that were paying that fine that taxes\nAre you an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys did a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations and\nGetting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of pre existing conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you like health care planning keep at ya\nFamilies who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they they are pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited ... plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that where you take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to four days which is they weren't robot yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer me new ability\nOkay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mama care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year you know they could get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back\nAnd nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guarantee remains in place those protections you can always go back to the Obamacare\nA exchanges if he can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to somebody you set a second ago and you set a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing of the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something but just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving\nThose individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the bond care exchanges we're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay that no this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because Romney want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects aren't preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nUh they think they can win the election but no I mean they're long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which ... which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts it tore his single payer\nGovernment run bureaucratic system that will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs more like thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double and it's still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down to number thirty two trillion\nThat really so much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson one last question I run a in a row which we should be accessing the time and You're welcome anytime my friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly I feel strongly that knowing that the Senate stay with you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly\nBut the house is starting to look like it's up for grabs were this blue wave was being talked about for six months do you think that the moves by ... Feinstein and and uh and Cory bookers barbecues and all these people in that process where do you think that's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and vote November\nJim Brown didn't say a whole lot because Congress said a ton and um it was funny because the president actually set up for Conyers rent you said a gym do you want to say anything at the gym road said no no I'm good I'm ... and nobody could blame him because of what can you just did it but yeah it was Jim Brown\nJim Brown is a guy who's been an activist his whole life is like eighty now something like that\nAnd um and he's one of the loudest voices telling NFL players in in this day and age or make it on average two million dollars a year stop it\nStop it supports the president's support the country support the the the idea that America is a great land the best on planet earth let me go back to its they had a gym in Idaho Jim what's happened and high\nEarning my own I guess so if your gym in Idaho\nYeah uh yeah I Want to talk about drug dollars but I I said thank God have we the people and we're the people\nYeah good for him a great\n... saw the ... protesters to go around and do all this stuff and we know that ... anyway I just wonder if you knew anymore but I Am I have one specific question I heard that I don't know it's true it does the film the electronic voting machine\nBut no I Would think no no the George Soros is not somebody who's a billionaire because he builds things he's a billionaire because of of the stock market I Believe um but no he he doesn't build the voting machines no\nOkay I heard that I was like wow if if if that was\nWell that would be ridiculous wouldn't have had bedbugs there'd be no yeah no\nThat would be that would be that anyway um yeah and why does not government here's something about him I mean they already know I mean if it's all over the\nAge of ... what do we do it's his money you could pay people\nAnd we just got to do you want to expose again but what what we need to do is let people know what you know and what I Know that he's a bad guy he's a socialist he was a Nazi sympathizer when he was a kid a ... and the guy

the weekend with Joe packs led to have\nYou long for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever it's a fun age will markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug Adler he's the managing director and senior vice president of investments room of dreams that associates a Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJohn great thank you so uh all the president has to say is that the fed is logo and that we get eleven hundred points to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know me I think the stock market as a slot machine anyway so I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about it can you\nPoint to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of thanks Joey what's always interesting about the market is things that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off shrug it off and then suddenly it it\nIt matters in I think what's kinda manifested\nHere as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough or a photo if you will in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything towards Seventy but still that's much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell button\n... do you have an opinion is Doug ... managing director senior vice president over at a room a gym that associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation target of two percent guy and then when you start to she\nMentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy is much stronger than it was when President Trump took office right you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah they want to just right and so they're trying to\nDo that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they're they're Damien to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug of a I heard today somebody made mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the mid term election if the if the Trump autonomy starts to tank and he's ... he didn't work all those ... that had tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational to think that politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself\nRight if you're right ... thanks go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments of regimes that associates so as we watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look how great I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubble bursting for for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for its britches\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people either I think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things but really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the problem\nThese I think you say this fits in the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence\nSo when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this\nIs really for found two things first one is debt service so that's\nJust simply what comes in and income or into a household and then what goes out for ... like student loans car payments mortgages\nCredit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies and household net worth it in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah so if my debt\nObligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending but it's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "year": "2018", "city":
