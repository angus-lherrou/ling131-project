and welcome to a crusty your Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh lots of stuff going on [laughter] but um I just find it very very hypocritical they were\nInterviewing this man to be a fair and fair and honest person to decide Supreme Court cases what we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he's accused of these baseless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victims survivor of a sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we lack\nAuthentication bike to a doctor for may have been assaulted but there is nothing to credit with Kavanaugh right if we let women like this come forward and do this kind of damage to match reputation it's actually going to step back women testifying by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done it when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we would want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist [noise]\nI have a friend that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here to kinda that if she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining the person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right that we get that when he showed his emotions want to get attacked unjustly\nYou can be more ... facing something one of the most unfair things I've ever seen it may be in charge is now going to be here and and ... about this I'm Sorry did them

you or doesn't remember anything does that mean isn't that all the victims the survivors that have ever spoken with every member every ...\nWhere she asked me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me I grew up in a single parent household with that there were six cats when\nI was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't come on right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right when she first started to lift me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later we after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure to say I\nHave someone that was in that room when I saw my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and I own a gun point kind of my family when I saw him in court I became physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him\nBut I became physically ill and I had a horrible memories of my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first mistake\nBut I Can't remember what I was wearing every single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing good isn't completely clear and Medicaid in my memory\nAnd I just I found hurting not credible with regard to cabinet and honestly I hate beta but I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I\nWas in law enforcement and I know what the standards are like that on her as now she's\n... and ... with us but but you you and I both know that the left said warriors we're going to do with was reporting better what she says the one we're going to use as credible to everybody that we go to and we're going to force them to all repeat credible because then the the the watching eliciting bubble would agree that you would credible but are around with you and I\nWas really on me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she stood up red capital wasn't that credible but that was the wrong uses your bed words and that's where I was I mean and I was a ... because I said that but still want to be I saw when I saw her but I heard\nThat even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and I I mean it was a way of how much I have personally been attacked\nBy either survivors probably all the victims\nBecause they've allowed it to victimize that like ... me away as I had a guy friends that I grew up with that but I Can't\nBelieve with your history Dr ... her I Would be doing a great disservice if I get\nA reward we have to run great phone call I appreciate you taking the John ... bet somebody who really

TV show 'em back then so we've been friends for a long time about jelly and I appreciate you how're ya\nI'm wonderful how are you today I'm doing great you know I started out when I answered the phone I submitted bizarro world and you actually very positive what you said you know really glad you know ... rode\nOut for me always as that Kavanaugh had last week an honest wake up on the center I had a mountain right\nI'm sure that great time to be alive as president is doing a fantastic job in keeping us peaceful and prosperous sounding music and art and you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think is right and then she meeting refused to comment and they've never seen a positive data point that they had it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy jealous God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even all the numbers you already know alone employment numbers among\nAfrican Americans in Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans and winning they're teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate of that but even today I was very little coverage anywhere\nBut it was an accident have one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand said the wages are up the job of Vail abilities that people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job

of course justice Gorsuch in\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice cabin on\nIts Kellyanne Conway a counselor to the president I got to tell you ... you know and by the way she was also the woman that\nThe president says was really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about cabinet or they couldn't make anything stick to base brought them early on as he said\nThey couldn't get him on the merits now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have stopped the auto of back when he was fourteen now the guy drew a piece of advice allegedly somebody at a bar after you'd be forty concert we visited ... states bizarro world they really have nothing against the guy\nWe have no way to stop the guy sold as mulatto sitting behind him and he's got a far left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out\nYou know some of these witnesses mean when you step back\nJust for a second and take a look at it they weren't going to be okay with anybody where they\nAre they're not they're not going to you that it said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominee right Supreme Court are certainly not going to\nFind their way to supporting judge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen [noise] certainly not after the ... they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this says this is about ... destroying a man's life\nBecause he ... he was nominated by Donald Trump does is it that they're laying and keeping that seat open path in terms of not three tiny tiny and Americans had it and ... are smart and they're watching this process people\nAre disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat due to blame\nThat she is now a household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelve hour had told and but for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the Senate Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed his last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens but if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats Joe pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between a ... on one hand your Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism\nAnd toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party and you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and ... and who is yours in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota now sprint they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending and voting for him\nIt's our tells the president Kellyanne Conway till you do you think that there should be an ethics committee I'm I'm an investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her staff leak that out you said on this for two months she could have talked to tell them about it directly when they met privately she could've brought it to the president as soon as you got the letter your rights she sat on a because the hope that they would\nBe him down on the merits they couldn't the guy is supremely\nQualified to be in this job news are going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw some members say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week as I say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the\nOf the letter and uh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to Ford's lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nWell it ever having a common washing either for lying under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and ... there are no cameras and clean lights in private testimony in California there's no Washington based\nObsessive media right to ticket to go and cover every jot until and a new client base for them afterward so that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for his confirmation happens\n\nGreat to have your will go to the program ... diamond and so coming your way next hour also and culture and doesn't\nCare she she goes right after these idiots in the left on the Senate Judiciary committee who are basically just been going after white men\nWhite men or the greater evil ever and it's okay to say so in this day and age which is kind enough to ... stick around to the phone lines now one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot com gonna be Jerry Michigan Jerry appreciate your patients what's going on\nYeah um yeah a Senator Murkowski um she really a shot herself in the foot there or what a thank you the Trump there he opened up to and are drilling platform more money for that state and that's the thanks she gave them\nYeah at least the Murkowski is not really a Republican she's more of a moderate even leaning left the chief somebody easily controlled by Dianne Feinstein and she made a big mistake you're either but she's going to be done in twenty twenty two\nI'm ... I Want to do I want to come up if I could put a shout out for the Michigan ... to vote for John James because we need guys or a stab at that but where do I get a retirement papers\nWhile I got to tell you very apropos Debbie Stabenow is better than that my job for so long that it wasn't when I was a TV news anchor there\nTwenty years ago twenty two years ago I was interviewing Debbie Stabenow she's been there forever and it is time for her to go ahead and and it had for the hills I'd love to see a James when I Try and try to get 'em on we've got Fifteen or sixteen stations in Michigan on a on a Monday through friday show and I'd love to get them on I also I also watch Judy to win the governor\nBut he's he's not looking very good right now we're going to get him onto\nYeah I'm a you know the price of a vice governor he's he's a socialist the guy he said he's a train wreck like a that a ... one from a queen\nWell they don't call it vice governor ... lieutenant governor don't they\nYeah lieutenant governor he [laughter] he get the social it we don't when we don't eat and then what happens if something happens to her and then he takes over\nNo I I hear you and I appreciate it begs ... you know what's interesting is Michigan when red\nMichigan voted for Trump Michigan be smart be smart if you vote somebody like um like the ... I Want to give their name recognition\nOver I'm\nJohn James and over over bill shooting it doesn't make sense you're actually going to be voting for somebody who would go against the trauma county who would go against the good things that Trump has done for industry bringing jobs back we think about that if you really want that it would go backward you'd be voting against\nWhat you voted for twenty sixty there's no good reason why\nAnd by the way those have you voted for Trump uh twenty six deep used and everything he promised he would do I can't imagine one good reason why you would make a vote on the state level or a local level that would go against that very it's very interesting to watch the process we go to line four it's going to be Bruce in North Carolina Hi Bruce\nRight but your face in the bone let's go\nTo my brother what's up with him yeah oh okay sure\nYeah hey I just want to say that uh [noise] I think what the Democrats are doing is fantastic they should or could have doubled down and get more ridiculous than just take everybody all at the end of the Clinton\nAgree with you I think that it's either going to make left to sit at home or some people who are moderately left might actually vote right\nDoes that how dumb this whole thing was\nThat this this craziness and they they need to just doubled down and do it again and and I and our next target and [noise] you know people\nI'd rather I Gotcha appreciated but what if what if very odd vote situation that was a I Know we put me on speaker and walk away and when he got berries are louder you solved but Bruce I think it's a point well taken as somebody who was a conservative in this country and I am I'm unabashedly conservative um I like to see when the left him floats and that's what they just did\nThose or just regular Americans who happen to be Democrats or or Lee liberal\nAnd by the way I have no need for you I understand there's a different position different outlook I get it but as they watched Corey group because Booker\nAnd and ah this\nRichard live lying about Vietnam Blumenthal and lay for God's sakes they I Know and I've got friends who we left\nThere were embarrassed was embarrassed you\nGoing to vote for these people they just made a mockery of what it is you say you believe it let me say Hi to Rick and good luck to your work what's going on\nHBO I can hear me yes demise Romero's go\nOkay I got from the army man I Am\n\nDie there you go let me go to a live virus Blake in Texas I ...\nI never got a question for you what kind of in a in a same camp or whatever by about you know I haven't heard anything that ... thing but you know that might happen but on the air Matt\nBoy she write him and I know the Trump rallies in her brother's up all the work for\nAn ...
