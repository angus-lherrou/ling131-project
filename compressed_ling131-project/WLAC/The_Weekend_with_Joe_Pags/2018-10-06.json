Kevin are was sworn in this evening as demonstrators gathered outside\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the claim well Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's ... incredible credible witness credible which is actually untrue she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually given a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand\nHas everybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend\nAnd every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was so as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets the help she needs some help the person who did it is brought to justice\nBut it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point of ... and that the the legacy media didn't want to have legacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably\nHad something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and didn't report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that\nAt a party they were playing some game that I don't know\nYou do to spin the bottle or it was ... ... they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk or you've got to remember anything and then she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it at near her face\n\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it so which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity\nIs truly sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys are taking in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for the another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch she changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC\nNews instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times that her history comes out that she somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay heat that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to ... they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because you know it causes all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he grow up to a girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent\nNothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is\nThis is Deborah bureaus completely uncorroborated aback refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd received for only

think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now go to any centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats\nIn the Senate and we'll keep control of that body ah it's still going to be very close in the house\nBut we have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country

Jeff\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture with a call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearing started let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you know all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his\nFamily Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him yet Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think lower started there were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans a grassy I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of this to be clear this room would be\nGiven interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol is when they were breaking it on purpose\nUs they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow waiting for them he turned out it made

dead so now they're [laughter] they're getting worse and not just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down they get it\nVery frustrating on the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that pointing a finger at a man next and guilty\nAnd you got to listen to Mossad if that's true but that's why the court case\nAnd I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy\nObviously had a lot of class he did very well rounded young man I\nCall and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill but ice he he\nHe gets to a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have to cross country now and understand that that's what
