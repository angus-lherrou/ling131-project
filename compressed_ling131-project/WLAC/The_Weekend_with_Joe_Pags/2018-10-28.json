the district that Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code words ... played with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how're ya\nHey gun good Joe thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living right now I Want to get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person but police say the FBI\nSays was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first sign relieved a cop that that is good police and law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what\nTo ... how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know had like a low on right\nNow he picked or they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it and again he didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e ... advice early on and he said you know some let's stop talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling in to the ... bomber they're calling you a ... bomber ... the people did not call the guy who shot up the baseball practice and an\nAlmost killed these college they didn't call him a Sanders shooter or some ... ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I'll tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing state do you want to take some ground or is the second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the violence happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guys sends out bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that it's thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back in ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point boy thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan\nPerhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies tax cuts that said rejuvenating the economy for decades and and the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half\nReally and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair uh it'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I only been two minutes and you're like you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American to pay taxes got a break every American who pays taxes as a bigger paycheck\nMany Americans three four five six million either got bonuses where they got raises companies are are now manufacturing stuff here again or promising gift to start doing it\nSo the other side Kevin seem all that success that\nWe've got we've got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas yeah our manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a

acted back to them with how\nThe current president President Trump is acting toward the media also ... will be off the top of the hour\nYup the former communications director for president Donald Trump what the hell out of marriage only on the job for a living days will have bad for you to write none of the phone lines delivers the alone welcome to outline one each Lisa in California Hi Lisa\nHi how are you I'm living the dream which I Would have\nBeen calling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about um went shooting how\nHow would you get that\nChurches that typically forget I mean schools are a whole nother story into our movie theaters and other other churches ... how would you\nGet at a church take action to sort out the bad guys from the gun versus the good guy with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy no and I certainly\nWhen I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility not only protect myself but anybody that night and it might come under attack\nAgainst a bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is a ... that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas do allow to in many places but at the same time they are also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that\nPoint if you're going to if you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is this if you're not going to allow me to carry my gun\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say\nThat that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you want to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns\nBut once we interviewed tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry our ...\nTwelve people died so we are I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't um or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance annex it\nThis way anybody getting ... getting out or anybody get a good move to be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility\nAnd they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they could pull the trigger one time\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it at the land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House\nSo so the people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House you can't get anywhere near that place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously that the economic a\nFull body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that it's not just that have an accent that the people around that men in a church probably qualified people that are\nGoing to be there any way to get out of that kind of thing\nBut then there's actually training involved and right now I just feel like it like I said it's not just I don't disagree\nWith you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost ... think that it's not a realistic idea at\nMy well I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if they do allow concealed carry by guys like you and me congregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like that also you you just have a bus system where you have to be ... to ... to ...

I'm a former communications director for the White House right\nWell yeah what was there for a wedding date was that\nThere were loving raised dais though maybe we're living amazing days come on\nLet's appreciate I had a great time you know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat but um you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president they're loyal to the president you know I did some a\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and try and then when I said that I called the president a liar now or is that the president is telling it like that and he's covering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you\nCause you to be like a school monitor all Proctor\nAnd it works every single time when you go to or CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've done work at CNN headline news on fifty eighth over there I mean how did that when you walk in it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize\nThat there was a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you were to get you know some some folks from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these horror this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figure that could kill me with the base but let's find people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I got fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very color or very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him you know what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were like young fathers obviously now deceased but I'm ready to get back into the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in\nWhat they were life so this is a real fun book to write a rocket called me yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said it was great he couldn't wait to show it to her father for it\nBut at one of his best friend said the same thing you know what I listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian\nI like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... record short for Pagliaro so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like today I got to tell you my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite\nMedia in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you are and they want that totally sanitizing edited\nAnd God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right\nThere's a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius daily dose\nOf ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm sure that's my personality\nI agree it's embodies their most of the blue collar President Bill blue collar president is out now go and get this great book let's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he said he's running for president were you a surprise I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually\nNot surprised they turned on him but he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty I'd gotten where you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your\nSome of your policies and you know we we let the band declare war on the media you know that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely like looks for a cost them out and tries to tell me your fake news editor at a cost to eats it\nUp and he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again I thought that it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House run the price\nI thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering Bijan ...\n... ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe ... era as press secretary I did the first press conference and I ... that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net my calms plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets context to\nEat was being very of secrets than flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story within a trail me around I was like well I'm not the bad and I'm not their self promoting myself when I\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that got it changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\n... you know exaggerated article and then he released tape you know four or five days later people look and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we wanted ambushes and see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so\nI thought it looked if you went back and if I\nIf you went and checked out the pod cast after your name I thought it was a good pick\nBecause I felt like you were a guy who wasn't gonna pull any puncture just who's going to be very direct you're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a administrators and here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered in a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happen to me\nBut you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do what you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's a vicious by first place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me\nUh a lot of my book is also about that ... that you know where I got up dusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because we never want to do is be on your back for too long if you don't\nWant that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it as it writing it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a Anthony Scaramucci and the name of the book is the blue collar president I urge you to go get it you'll get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the color president a last question and I think people are dying to know the saying what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say it's good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the part of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him a\nI had a very good conversation with them last July regarding trade I put in an op ed in the ass gee we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similarly I'm and I'm not stored and my hope is not a sort of me for what happened he seems to be\nA that kind of guy I right at the end of the book guys like ... date bossy myself a day was environment where he was fired I was fired I call us ...

are important number one when you called your radio show\n'em you can't both be heard at the same time so when you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you got stopped for a second and then I'll let you continue but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone and I have control of of what's being heard at any given time I now have a decision to make\nEither both of us speak at the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to or either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue\nBut if you're gonna make allegation after about an allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there were there were a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... in Islam a folk that's just not true um the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides there are very fine people on both sides\nThat if they were talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues of Confederate a war heroes or soldiers or leaders\nThat's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can\nAnd they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there which are history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people on that side absolutely so he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on and you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest\nThat he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms were I guess he I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that the ... he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forums as as most people do\nAnd the president went to I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't mimicking him that way and be\nVery good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are a ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of a reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do the reporting till two veteran sixteen\nOr maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a door that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me and Donald Trump um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research and independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant what hand motion to do and as you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter and then you make the decision\nBut if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide to know squad an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact at the end of the day no more than I Do but you failed any debate when you walk in picking your superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics were so bring it next time again it was a little but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate sharia\nOn this great job\nReally glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention it appears to be a plane of some sort and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nWell we're right here at the Reagan Library that that are at fourteen at that Jen is one of the famous jets that little off the carrier or a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots when they came after our fleet at one point to Nineteen eighty [laughter]\nI I Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and
