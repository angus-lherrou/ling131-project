{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Eighth it's twenty Seventeen was the last night I went to church um\nEarly in the day it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we were gonna separate oh separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating [noise]\nUm and I looked at it on that day as a\nAs a new beginning and go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you were going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do clean I I Will tell you that\nI ate whatever was written about me was false patently false ... it was a lie it never happened in it and no one has ever ever\nCome forward there was all in on them as a source in\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on and go find another job this could just go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mine for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do because the ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night\nAnd we didn't celebrate the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start and then I\nDrink on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang I was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr bowling call her son called Eric right away so what's wrong is just cleric right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying for some reason I just went right to um\nIs he alive [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] she got now [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was ... the next state went to Colorado\n[noise] and uh the president called me as anything we can do for you I said no thank you [noise]\nBut at that day I realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to create awareness around a opioids\nAmerica or what his antics on campus [noise]\nWaste with ... ... so yeah so that was that day [noise] uh\nAnd so now we are a year in\nTwo days after that and it's been rushed home you we can stop at any time if you don't want to talk about anything so um [noise]\nI think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive why\nWe're there indications or was it just a bad feelings of feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and it's told the call your son right away without explaining why I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat and all it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed and it was an accidental overdose [noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I at that moment I had no fight needs to do anything [noise]\nSo um we spent my wife and I just got very close we spent the better part of the next year just talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that\nIt's an epidemic excuse me and a and\nA ... parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and that and through here every taking the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlantic City exposed to potentially dying from an overdose\n\nIt's a very emotional and I think important um interview\nThere\nThere are places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think tense\nUm and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on the opioid thing I mean I I um I got an emotional whole yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you for speaking up for opioids because there are those of us who\nWe cannot live without them we can't do this woman said because of her disease she can't even sit up in bed and she's bed written\nWithout the opioid there are you know\nAll of these things they're double edged swords they're they're good when they're used properly and they are\nDeadly when they are abused and uh it's up to each of us uh to to know what we're dealing with and they are deadly um that podcast also goes into his relationship with the president and what he is seen as the president\nAnd uh it's a very fascinating interview\nEric bowling you can find that podcast wherever you download your podcast I tunes now and modify but everywhere or the Glenn Beck podcast they come out every Saturday and different interview with somebody who is truly fascinating\nYou go outside and write the aren't they were just make it a net flicks weekend or find out what the latest Weather Channel ... talk radio Ninety eight point three men Fifteen ten W.

or either sent them both take any Katie on your phone number is it thirty second you can have peace of mind knowing your heart rate them as normal cardio is ...\nShe's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and it's like now giving her ... ... ... years the odds\nThen and the whole thing is odd but it was among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or where you see me during the week on Newsmax\nWhen you turn it on and somebody has presented as an expert on something like I'll have\nAn author on are all have a geologist honor all have a an actor honor and I'll say this is an activity you might remember from is this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son\nYou'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person on some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the first is getting paid for your parents or an analyst\n\nGenerally speaking up or is it getting paid too\nBut they keep on presenting it wasn't a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today I'm I'm confused why are we doing a story and Elizabeth into\n\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment\nThen\nOf course the lousy for and what have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment and she's never really said why and again I don't really care white illicit model thinks why she's not an expert\nI talked about this while I've talked about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen\nFor a long time and we stayed ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nAlyssa Milano is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense you have to the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think\nThat she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out there like a like me\nTo buy into this far left wing garbage listen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but she doesn't when all is a mulatto actually does issue hurts the draws\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way look how dumb this the\nThing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing or look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThat don't misunderstand me I'm actually at this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously\nBut you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\nBut there you go and you turn on the job or or you read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto\nAnd they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe all as a whole lot I'll be\nCause fill in the blank just doesn't happen oh another trending thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ... robbery ... of course the Confederate general who lost\nAnd had to surrender to to us rent\n\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ... period end of story and of course\nThat's the only peering under storage your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert Daly on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\n\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\n\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that\nYou don't have the president said it that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Roberts Lee are they telling the truth yes\nBut it's also a sin of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd than they are fantastic it's worth it's the best thing I don't get to my my plane back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar [noise]\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good then he kicked this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\nThat was the context\nBut white tell the truth when you can lie and then corrected later and by the way on social media when you lie under your your legacy media tens of thousands of a retreats likes when you're correct it\nA few hundred that's the way it goes in this day and age\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero bottom of this hour it's gonna be former Governor Sarah Palin\nThe great state of Alaska what a great conversation I had with her and how we ended up connecting on

weekend with Joe ... and I'm Glad to have your own for the ride a there's a lot going on this past week\nI was able to connect with us or a payload yes that Sarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee for vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened\nAnd in our show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and are you hoping you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream where and watch it because the scenery behind her is beautiful in Alaska but do lose Jones boys and girls who served nearly Sarah how are ya\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nA vigil for not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday because people know I was actually on this was unfolding on me or live you're listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening just want to see a good point I said man you've got a famous name and correct\nMe if you're a teacher was you remember what you said you said he's really me I promise\n[laughter] like\nGoing back and forth and I can eat it oh\nMy goodness somebody in cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and we get along so thank you for doing that and know it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening [laughter] I get up and I'm like I Know what I'm trying to verify it me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from sure appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you must you settle this once and for all and it's a good as we gotta figure so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone having my own work by that time out of the vehicle and we're all press the button to try to figure out how to say that\nWord Doug 'cause you press the button you took my time and very ... her son Tina Fey that's her that's [laughter] I Know you've got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican\nIQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDid the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further\nWriting campaign after he lost the primary up here remember it was her dad Senator Frank were kept you after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on ... and I ran against him into heated him for it that's how we got and that's how we stayed in a sense they demand once you're in and you have these special interest from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good manners\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor with this kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our call them the our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate but you know you are you like was it up and I circuit court of appeals that I'll I'll repeat that in the second it's us or opinion of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all run person so you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going right in my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nSo and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in\nThe United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nExactly right and Joe I'm breath because nobody else was talking about that book share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out I don't know about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why\nWe don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous another thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing Al Gore\nThat's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five\n... one of the biggest outrageous I reported on trial of abortion doctor ... now how the woman goes you know when it comes out that there is no police report I helped expose", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
