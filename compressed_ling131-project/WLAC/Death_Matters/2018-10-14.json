Europe during World War two right back when this wakes up he sees the light and he decides I'm no longer communist this is an evil ideology goes underground with his family goes into hiding\nBut then finds Jesus becomes a Christian and off the wall\nHe realizes that he knows where all the Soviet agents or the U.S that it's ... yeah and he says I Do the right thing I Need to on top of these moles that that I was working with it goes to the FBI\nFBI is an interest that he goes to the White House to truly administration not interested and finally Nineteen forty eight it gives the first ever televised a congressional\nTestimony as a congressional stuff that you may have heard of Richard Nixon ... jets\nReally um you know a stimulated get motivated by this testimony and he says\nI Know where the bad guys on one of them is is former presidential advisor to former State Department official champion of the left a darling of the media called al ... is right and he goes on record for the truth to say this man is a communist and he's a ... by\nThe left decides to destroy him\nThey publicly accused him of being an alcoholic of being a closet homosexual they say that this man is with all the both of the death of his own brother and all of it\nIs an ... up to lie but chambers never give us and he never surrenders and eventually long enough that he that we have the ... the crap that the Soviet signals intelligence intercept\nThat prove that yes lo and behold out this was a Soviet agent at the top about government\nSo if you're surprised at what the Democrats did justice Kavanaugh over the last month don't be they get up they done it before and not just Clarence Thomas they did it back in Nineteen forty eight with this great American hero Whittaker Chambers\nThat is the ... steak will voice of Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies that's an unbelievable story because I ... and again I'm you when I talk about it all the time and you know they're not as smart as you um but but I Know a little less reactor\nFact [laughter] I I H A\nI Know a little bit about history I pay attention I I Do a little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago how they do the exact rice said em oh this is a modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing or on the copper doors of of the Supreme Court so you're saying\nThis is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens\nWhen you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided that the end that there are ... getting power\nJustifies the means this is what you end up doing it will destroy innocent man\nYou will try and you'll use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can set it doesn't matter what I Do to another human being because I have to have the power and that's why it was so important I I couldn't put it in my book you know why we fight half about that\nMAOA but when the president stood out in the White House two days ago\nIn front of the world I pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did the justice capital\nAnd then for announced it and if that that was a historic moment because justice wicket chambers within his said Seventy years ago so is justice cabin or a good man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies going good five copies giving to your friends and family doctors Sebastian Gorka that yeah I\nI read the audio book this time so the whole book in order for me with my funny acts that\nIt's not funny at all that that that's going to sell a billion copies everybody wants to hear you read the book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left\nThat that you so well say actually I've talked to my my friend did go ... about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but uh I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas so successful because the right\nAlways cow town gave in and again you just I've outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice Kavanaugh decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and pull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I'm I'm a ... and the strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refused flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I didn't know whether it was what's the post ... at it I said no why would I talk to people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to talk on record her off wreck or the trouble is\nThe majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing\nThe majority of their ... with a GOP Senate is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the joke they won the approval of the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem and you know why that is so ridiculous number one\nThey wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly\nWho cares about CNN yeah you know I I I noticed the cause of the White House book is you know how many people watched the most\nQuote unquote important show on CNN every night and this and ... have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... like all the ... yes he is the king millions and millions and millions of us every show\nAnderson Cooper the star of the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow this you don't want to record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nYeah we're probably gonna happen and they're going to get away with it as high as ...\nWhich which is which is not going to have you know but we're going to go and vote\nWell I ... yeah we don't know and\nThen yeah they are going to let their guard down there and and we want when\nI got you have to agree with your lead crystal you're\nYou're absolutely ... percent right I couldn't agree more appreciate job and I know one hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty I think that's the big fear or I noticed the big fear for me anyway as somebody who believes in traditional American values conservatism so on um that that will lose that sort of anger that we got from watching what Kavanaugh was put through\nAnd we won't go make that votes at the at the the polling place you need to go\nYou could go and vote early voting starts do for a lot of people some have a whole month of early voting your your early voting now do

we sat quietly\nDuring the Clinton years gathering on ... years and we were in the office of the president fat with my commander in chief\nAnd sound right I don't look I don't recall anybody on the conservative Republican side\nDoing any of this violence on that that I'm seeing now happening and I'm not an extreme right fine print but I'm definitely\nOn time on the conservative Republican Christians fight is how we were military family I mean daughter I've been home\nAnd and this this violent terrified somebody's going to get hurt and I ...

is the weekend with Joe ... we're always glad to catch up with my former governor the go former governor the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well with the actors that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about bad we talked about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well uh ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much where I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know in Texas but it's a it's what I called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook\nAnd on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and they'd back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was good until all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would\nBe in all those markets because it's you know we are now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent that's grit and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being\nThere uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as a as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know as a salesman\nFor American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's\nA A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the ah the terror of talk of the trade talk and the leverage that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining ... putting terrorist is going to ruin trade\nAnd in no time sweat biggie you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now or you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick do we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross gay all have\nA role to play in that and and uh so I absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons\nThat I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his\nErie here is that listen if I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals he comes with some really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young kid and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions\nBut tariffs at retro a trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a they know that we will lose a\nA trade war or or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customer they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property rights of any good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of of Greg habit now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got\nTo see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things are outdated you know think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is running side that was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree\nUh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different\nPositions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the
