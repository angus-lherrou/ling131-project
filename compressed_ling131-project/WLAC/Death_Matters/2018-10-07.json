about the midterms about Kavanaugh about about the good things happening in this country\nAs his father is the president of the United states that's right Donald Trump junior top of the hour right here on the weekend with Joe package we go back to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to a Christian you Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh a lot of stuff going on [laughter] you bet on TALK to me I just\nFind it very very hypocritical that here were interviewing this man to be a fair and fair and honest person to get tied to print in court\nCases right we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry and when he was accused of these faceless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never have that ... survivor of sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we lack\nA validation bike or I'm Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing compared that with Kavanaugh rent if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women path defined by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBickering women have notoriously gun at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want this ... that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh who surprisingly enough he now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now\nIt's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socially\nI have a friend that that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and they came to that if she is a hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining the person for a job in court where he's supposed to be fair\nRight that we get it that when he showed his emotions\nIt gets attacked unjustly\n... you're going to be more correct that he ... something one of the most dogs there are things I've ever seen and then be chargers no going be fear and and level of ended about this I'm Sorry to absorb that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was lousy board doesn't remember anything\nDoes that mean if you did all the victims\nAll the survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered and revert\nWhere she lives with me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me agreement single parent household with that there were six cats when\nI was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't how my mom right away but I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to lose me with one she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when\nAfter she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure had they\nHad someone that was in that room when I saw my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my own a gun point in front of my family when I saw him in court I became physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him\nBut I became physically ill and I have a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first mistake\nBut I can remember what I was wearing every single detail and both times every single detail\nThere's nothing that isn't completely clear and cemented in my memory and I just I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and honestly I hate to but I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because\nI was in law enforcement and I know it ... ... oh my God on her as now she's\n... and I'm ... I'm with you but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was reported let her what she says the war and we're going to use is credible to everybody that we talk to and we're going to force them to repeat credible\nBecause then the the the watching eliciting mobile will agree but she was credible but around with you and I and I said there's really on me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible would bug that was the wrong usage of words and that's\nWhen he suggested to you and it's Donald Trump junior really glad to have the time when he suggested to you and your and your siblings I'm probably going to really do this your initial reaction was well of course you should do it or no way dead\nListen I I wanted them to do it I you know he had been so Bogle he'd been so you know tough on it and and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that's going on you say that the ... the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know there's so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck\nSo few that I'd ever you know in our whole political system that has ever had\nTheir someone's family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean that\nWas the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming ... you know\nI remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like\n[laughter] now now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation they enroll hatred of towards business we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father say I don't know why we couldn't have three\nThree and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and like look there's no magic wand for that right in New York Times back him up no no no because you know of course he can do no wrong\nNone of this is the new normal well Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you haven't done anything\nIt turns out you know you're ... you're\nDone anything you'd never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he has built businesses he didn't build that\nInstill it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment for Hispanics for women you know you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the\nDon't ask Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nDemocratically be against it I mean that's their policy it's just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's they've done I Love your dad doing it's so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but as I say well how well who you're voting for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November right they're not they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on and make sure the fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform there's other than you know hate and outrage I mean you know what they are outraged that they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else but they are turning up we got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no\nNo the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win as saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you got to stay at we can't just be fat happy\nIn lazy and expect that stuff to continue he needs guy he need guys like Ted Cruz he needs guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself he imagined giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nBut is there a question I think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this\nCountry because we got to turn to you know we've got to bring our friend it's trending on drugs today to you blow so you're saying I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and do we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time we didn't want\nIt was common sense and experience right you know this isn't a magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects your weight real change when it comes to economic fiscal policy on fiscal but I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end they'll look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts find you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama dead when they cross it they slap you in the face well they they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles in ... I guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can't be renegotiated can be done\nAnd congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done ... when I went when it's when you have a real leader\nWish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known how did he says is all the time to ... is dead and gone one person steps up and says former President Obama just told me one thing you did\nThat caused this to happen because how do you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama did and fixed everything how can Obama even for a second even think to himself\nYeah I did that because we're not\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media will yeah like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent what doesn't that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of the ticket\nI mean that's the only way you know his his money is coming from all places other than like this\nBecause you know those are our tax at the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice in the ... I mean I only saved nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should\nGet rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends and you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is\nLook at what's going on your place of work what can your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I may have changed and we have\nTo remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the extras let's talk about Texas I as you know I'm based in San Antonio fifty stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because there's been a real challenge Robert Francis awoke is what I call him he's somehow called appropriating base Hispanic but he's not he's\nNot at all and spending on he'll pretend he is for those but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic selling for granted that something like that they would destroy absolutely you you you were doing it every day for it or\nIt's not a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it wouldn't be you know he should be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing you know it's been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform I'm like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator and Texas\nWell he's getting big support for Mellon so you know that's a good\nIdea it's Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who uh I ... from ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do was the first thing is your dad and Ted went out in the primaries but\nThey're very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically they say I'm going to do this this this this and this and you're dead and had\nActually believe I should do those things I promised bigger it was just given us you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I listen I I really respect them and it looks like it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was brutal\nPrimary there was a big a a dinner in DC you know the usual\nYou know this stuff [laughter] I I I went and all my friends are from Texas I'm there all the time hunting fishing or a lot of money during the campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and avid it a couple of friends ... at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner we say hey you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel\nRight in the middle of DC on Pennsylvania Avenue a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along\nIt came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours nice that took guts yeah but you know and it showed me\nThe guts if he understood down from going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good protects and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies\nAnd that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant or because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where ... worked ... money is probably coming from writing\nThat probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in a Hollywood studios so you know that's the difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nTexas I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all the stats but you want to become California give me a ...\nAnd the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior ...\nYou have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...

V. show 'em back then so we've been friends for a long time about Kelly and I appreciate Joe are you\nI'm wonderful how are you today I'm doing great you know I started out when I answered the phone I submitted bizarro world and you actually very positive what you said you know really glass bowl right\nFor me always as that Kavanaugh had last week an honest wake up on the center I had a mountain right\nI'm sure that great time to be alive as president is doing a fantastic job in keeping us peaceful and prosperous some music and art and you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think is right I mean she meeting refused to comment and they've never seen a positive data point that they had it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy jealous God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even at all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among African Americans in Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans and went in and

created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand said the wages are up the job of Vail abilities that people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and that's what freedom looks like the deregulation agenda\nThat the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit court of course justice Gorsuch and [noise]\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice cabin on\nIts Kellyanne Conway a counter to the president I got to tell you ... you know and by the way she was also the woman that\nThe president says was really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about cabinet or they couldn't make anything stick to the throughout um early on as he said\nThey couldn't get him on the merits now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have started the auto of back when he was fourteen but now the guy drew a piece of advice allegedly somebody at a bar after you'd be forty concert we visited ... states bizarro world they really have nothing against the guy they have no way to stop the guy sold as mulatto sitting behind him and you've got\nA far left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out you know some of these witnesses mean when you step back just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody where they\nAre they're not they're not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominee try Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and they should just be honest about what this says that he's about to start destroying a man's life because he he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open\nPath in terms of not three tiny tiny and America has had it\nAre smart and they're watching this process\nPeople are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat due to blame they share now household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelfth our had told and\nBut for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's a Senate committee and the majority of the other Republicans they gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice in the air this week and\nSo that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um expand supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed fix\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed his last July which is on the desk and every senator so we'll see what happens\nBut if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats cheer pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between a ... year Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and toward destruction and resistant an obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as uh\nOf your party and you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians and and ... and who is in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota now spread they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending and voting for him\nIt's a counselor the president Kellyanne Conway till you do you think that there should be an ethics committee I'm I'm an investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her staff leak that out she sat on this for two months she could have talked to Kavanaugh about a directly when they met privately\nShe could've brought it to the president as soon as she got the letter your rights she sat on her because she hoped that they would beat him down on the merits they couldn't the guy is supremely qualified to be in this job and these are going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw some memory say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the of\nThe letter and the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to forge lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to for that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nBut I'm having a kind of washing either foreign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and then fill or is there to tell if he does there are no cameras and clean lights in private testimony in California there's no Washington based", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Death
