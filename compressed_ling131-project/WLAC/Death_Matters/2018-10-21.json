{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Yeah so the question is how long will your income last will your money last as long as you do\nAnd can you account for inflation on that and so really when you talk about planning for a long retirement you want to plan for a good long retirement\nAnd how do you plan for a good long retirement and you want to make sure that someone has done a long ... studied where your income is sustainable it goes up with inflation you know talking to a guy recently who said you know\nWe're taking the same amount of money is out today is a war ten years ago but just doesn't seem to go as far well the reason doesn't go far as because of inflation and so you want to really planned for hopefully will will be a very healthy and long retirement for you and or your significant other\nBecause people are living longer and it's a it's a huge mistake not to do that and the uh this last point I was you know I Want to park on some today because I think now given where the market is some of the volatility we've seen and just as high as there's there's probably never been a better time to be talking about this next point and that is that your plan\nShould match your risk profile and that is a key an important question\nWell we love doing the full blown comprehensive analysis for folks and just this past week I was able\nTo deliver one of these to a family that listen to us on the radio and finally pick up the phone and came in and they were so glad they did is I went over this analysis there's lots of things covered in that analysis cost them nothing about an hour of their time there's a\nThere's a fee report or risk analysis and income plan a stock intersection plan a Social Security maximize or a forward looking tax strategy and more in there but one of the things that in there John is or as you know in the early section\nOn on their risk and one of the things that if you're somewhere where you can write this down write this down to ask us about if you come in it's called variants me a R. I. A. N. C. E.\nI showed them their variant score and they're wanting to protect and conserve and be more conservative and they're variance score John was Seventy two that mean that that's the rains that it could very in one year from negatively or positively so it was like\nYou know if we had a really bad year they could lose as much as we'll call it thirty six it was in the thirties and then if it was a really good year it could make thirty six they're like well\nI think if we look back in the past we know there have been years we lost thirty six but we don't ever remember making thirty six and one year but how why you're variants score is determines how much risk and volatility you have\nAnd they wanted to be conservative and they weren't even moderate they were beyond that aggressive\nAnd I'll tell you ... you know uh I this is a very similar to a couple I sat down with who getting ready to retire in about six months and similar situation there variants was a positive forty one to a negative thirty eight and uh they said well how do you feel about that I said well look when you're in you're working years\nWhy are the range of various better you are because if the market's down as long as you keep putting money in that four one K. are that are I don't don't quit investing one of the market is down ... you're you're buying stocks on sales right 'cause over time the market comes back your dollar cost averaging [noise]\nBut I said when you get retired you want to narrow that various you want to reduce it because now you're not putting money and you're taking money out and it's a much different occurrence ah and people don't typically\nChange their strategy\nSo narrowing that range of variance when you get close to retirement or really be what we call the red zone of retirement which is really the five to eight years leading into retiring but I Will tell you this if you are concerned at all about how high the marketers and we in the market could keep going some of the fundamentals\nOf the market are very very good um but then there's some things that you need to be aware of for example I had a gentleman asked the other day goes or what do you mean I said well how about that and America's an all time high goes on on the national\nDebt is highs and no not the national debt consumer debt consumer debt today Seventy percent of what drives our economy is consumer spending and there's and that has never been higher than it is right now [noise] sooner or later people are gonna have to pay for the deaths that they've racked up and so I'm not saying that the rails the economy but if I'm retired and I'm looking for sustainable\nIncome and I don't want to see a lot of ... those are facts that I Want to be aware of and I want to make sure that my wrist score is conducive to where I Want to be right now at this stage in\nMy life so what is your wrist score\nAnd would you like to know we'd love to be able to show you what you need to do is pick up the phone give us a call right now stylist number six one five three nine five three thousand if you don't know\nWhen is a good time to find out we think sooner than later and especially if you are now in the red zone of retirement that's five years or closer into retirement many of you when the last big lost in the markets\nTwo thousand and eight happened you were a long ways from retirement and now you're in the red zone is right around the corner you're already retire and now you're in the withdrawal stage and the conservation staging the moderate stage\nDon't you want to know what your risk or might be you need a strategy for this and then on going as you get older and begin to take this money out in time is not on your side as much you need to make sure that you have a strategy for that so we love\nTo help people with mitigating their risk profile and their risk by giving them more of things that are more income generating principle protected given reasonable rate of return bond alternatives these kinds of things again\nThese are the seven and things that were brought up a in this Forbes article last one being your plans should match or risk profile and I think over the last ten years this is probably the most important time right now\nThere's a lot of things to consider not trying to scare anyone we're trying to warn people\nThis is a perfect time than if you feel uncomfortable you need to get your risk taking care of and you need to find out what that risk score is and what you might do about part of it so again are you ready to retire\nYou might be more ready than you thought you were you may be a lot further away but either way it's good information to know because then you can act on those things and do something about it\nSo we'd love to customers on

would this have been back in the day of four day school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to announce hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for a day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we and I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical a situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district in early spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation\nBecause everybody's really spread out and I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add\nHours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum\nUh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeded the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and\nIt's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nKnow how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nA marijuana and different cities across the U.S and Canada and compared it in what they found is that a candidate says about thirty percent cheaper\nAnd Canada than it is and the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because Kennedy was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses\nA for many years now and so there's a wider range of dispensaries there's a wider range of producers in Canada than there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that\nUm that wider range of production ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply it you know whereas here in the U.S ah you know except for the states where it's legal or illegal at the federal level and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAre so at the medical marijuana been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know\nThey have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so you know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and\nAnd you know if you if you look at the videos and stuff coming in from Canada folks are you know kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with ... personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's it costs breakdown is it done it done by Alan so I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per eighth of announced that but the measurement they use [noise]\nWhereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of it now so you know for for allowing multiply that out be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S I'm various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly\nWhere it was most expensive was in San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but never the last you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having the you know set up a whole\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and so that makes things harder and drives up costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level or you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada where there is this very robust cannabis industry already in place\nRestricted marketwatch personal finance reporter Jacob ...\nThirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n...
