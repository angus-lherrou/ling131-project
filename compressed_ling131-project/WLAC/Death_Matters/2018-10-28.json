{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Do you think it's so easy to kind of neglect preparing for risk when when we're kind of in this bull market what makes it so so hard to to sit\nAnd look at the risk well a lot of it as emotions I mean del bar is one of the most leading a research firms out the studies investor behavior and you know people are very emotionally driven\nOh they feel really really good and for almost when the market is going up and feel really really bad\nWhen the market is going down and they they want to believe that they they buy low and sell high but for most people they they buy high when they're feeling comfort and they sell low when they're feeling pain and\nWe think that any investment decision made out of fear of emotions is a bad deal for the consumer you should never do that would begin or or anybody else\nBut you know it's it's one of those things that if the market is doing really well you feel like it's always going to do really well and markets are not designed to just go up forever and or they designed to go down forever I mean\nYou know uh it's usually a once in a while we'll have some of them come in and say well you know I was\nThis email the other day and somebody was telling me how the economy is going to crash and burn and and I should sell everything I have and buy a bunch of gold coins or something like that and or they've got the perfect place I can put all my money and typically what you'll find somebody to selling a newsletter or book or something like that there there is no perfect answer\nOr what needs to happen is you need to understand your risk and if there is a downturn and you're retired or you're close to retirement as your income going to be there\nBecause what really hurts evil and retirement in my opinion is not market downturns because those happen\nIt's market downturns combined with the loss of income or having to sell securities when the market is really low so if if I have a good income plan\nOn not having to sell my risk based assets at a low and I'm probably not as concerned if I Know I've got income coming and so it all kinda fits together but it is important to understand that risk\nWell you mentioned this a little bit and answering that question and it brings us to kind of lost the blind spot on the list\nAnd it's a big one is procrastination I'm this is this is such like you said it's very common common particularly when there's a bull market we're in is common for people to be looking to to make a change to to give that extra measure of preparedness on their plan\nAnd so I mean I Believe all the folks tuned in today show would agree that retirement planning is extremely important or they simply wouldn't be listening to the show because I don't want to just here are pretty voices\nSo why is it so easy for them to stay on the sidelines when it comes to retirement planning and not just jumping in and and kind of grabbing the bull by the horn and going I Want to get this right I Want to be very ... and when my plan well\nI think there's a lot of reasons for that I think you know first and foremost in a life gets busy um you know I've got three young boys ah that that all play soccer and a family and ... and obviously work in my church and [noise]\nYou know generally speaking people are are incredibly busy\nUm but they also kind of feel like I'm you know there's there's so much information they ... they don't know how to decipher it all and that's why planning takes\nYou know time is not an immediate decision with us or anyone else or certainly shouldn't be I think a lot of it is is a lack of understanding that's why I Believe our process is is unique and the sense that it's about educating people about getting data into their hands\nBecause the truth is we want people to understand what they have and what options they have it regardless if they do business would be can or not\nYou know sometimes I feel like they can't afford it you know when you when you use phrases like full service wealth management and we have a CPA in a state attorney and were financial advisors\nWell you know I come from a farming family average household income or where I'm from is about forty thousand dollars a year so you know I'm I'm blessed to live in Williamson county or here in Nashville I mean any pocket and ask for the most part it's a great place to live\nBut I understand what it's like to grow up in that field I Can't afford things and so the truth is you can always afford to have a good plan\nAnd then its analysis paralysis as we call it you know people just get stuck\nAnd you know the the fear of of something new and it's not easy to sort of barrier financial soul out to somebody that you don't know or or maybe feel like um there's some embarrassment there may be that you have a plan well or whatever\nBut the bottom line is um you need to take action 'cause procrastination will cost you know this is the in the U.S is very biblical you know clearly they asked us has a ... eleven forces\nWhoever watches the wind will not plant whoever looks at the clouds will not rape and uh you know regardless of whether you're a person of faith and that's got a lot of truth to it you know if you don't take action you're you're never going to know whether your situation can be improved or not and you may find and going through the analysis that we offer\nThat you're exactly where you need to be I just met with a guy to day they came in and it was a very unique you came in really good guy told me that he had been to all kinds of dinner seminars and things like that and he said I've never followed up with anybody and he said there was something about yours that intrigued me\nAnd I wanted to come in and I wanted to show you what I have and what you thought\nSo we looked at what he had\nAnd um we talked for a good bit and I looked at him and honestly I could not improve it he had really done a phenomenal job for his family had an incredible plant had worked with someone in another state and then moved here recently\nAnd you know what I really respect that sometimes we can't help people they don't want our help for they don't need our help but there's a lot of people out there that they're never going to know if they don't take that first step\nSo if we can help you will tell you that but if we can and will be able to show you that to research enter process because we believe that's really important\nSo love blind spots that we've covered here today announced quickly go through the list again but\nWe we look hidden fees again not having that forward looking tax plan not knowing your retirement and number\nNot optimizing the Social Security income that you have another big one

then not sticking out the rioting visor on John talked about the value of I'm really trying to find someone that's going to a blind with your philosophy and really give you in our opinion mixture there you're covering a comprehensive approach the retirement\nAnd then of course the the last one procrastination and so if if that's you you're sitting on the fence trying to figure out what to do do something today pick up the phone and give us a call or go meet with another body that you've been you've been thinking about just do something today we need to go ahead and take take action\nYeah I'll tell you there there's no better time than the president you know we put and you come and see us and you get a stop to visit with you and you want us to do some homework for you there is no costs will but your portfolio through a comprehensive wealth analysis report\nThat's where we're going to do at a retirement income plan and we're going to do a detail stress tests to show you how much risk that you potentially have\nWe're going to also do the reporting attacks announced it will look at your healthcare\nThe bottom line is these are all reports that you need to have in your hands that you can have in your hands that are going to give you a solid answers on whether or not we can help you and if we can help you great if we can't help you then you go on with a lot of peace of mind and knowing that you've got a really really good plan\nGive John in the ... called the day six one five three and five three thousand unscheduled visit 'em and if you're ready for change are looking for a second opinion like John mentioned there is no fees there's no obligations and you're you're not going to have a bad sales job when you come in\nThis is a service that we're offering just to help you

comfort zone of life what can I Do differently today and take one step up\nAnd one step out to set an intention towards something new so what is that new dream or that new opportunity like we're suggesting so it's one step at a time\nI saw a bullet point in your notes here what I thought was interesting uh what do you say is the fastest way to destroying your dreams\nNot believing in yourself and if you notice I said not sabotaged by others that self sabotage because we believe the lies and then we allow the fear and why do we do a sad yeah why why how how do we stop or why do we do is both yeah\nHow we stop doing it start to really realize who we are and valuing those aspects that are subtle and so it's being able to be reflected a little bit which not a lot of people enjoy it\nThe guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI've heard of people being stimulated buried alive waterboarded forced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire there's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times though one recently the event concluded with him stripped his boxers and curled into fetal position taken mud straw and simulated body fluids his first words afterwards that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was at and\nYou know it was interesting because that took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV they were stripped of their clothes and put in this stress base here\nAnd they were told that they were these criminals that had been bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking them through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and they ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this fog and this man is monster with a mask\nJust pops out of nowhere and starts rationing them around and rich the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear and is just nearing simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest than\nYes so the majority of these protests are going to that end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was the ... about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking wow that they must be really shaken up and they are\nBut as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would give it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some rules of these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys was kind of funny and he told me that his only rules were basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred then\nYeah but you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having no touching rural and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and\nSome of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with circus scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and you know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being torture but\nThe beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves the story forward there are all about it\nThis
