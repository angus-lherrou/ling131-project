an opportunity to mail in your ballot please don't wait until election\nDay [noise] every year I received quite a number of emails from folks who for one reason the other were not able to vote on election day you can imagine the various reasons they get hospitalized they get called out of town on worked unavoidable\nTheir kid gets terribly ill they don't want to leave them there in an auto accident you name it it happens and then you don't get to vote in your vote counts it matters especially your vote\n'cause you're the smart voters we don't have enough of you so we need every one of you to vote vote early vote straight Republican ticket it matters [noise] I've been asking\nFolks to uh tell me about your voting experiences T W writes I went to the Jersey village this is in the greater Houston area went\nTo the Jersey village polling location and about eleven this morning nothing unusual everything went very smoothly I did not vote straight Republican ticket this time I could not cast my vote for the Alamo destroyer George Bush instead I voted for the libertarian candidate may I suggest you advise to voters to do the same we should not disturbed that hallowed ground\nYeah my problem with telling people to vote anything other than straight party ticket is that it gets lost in the translation so while I think George Bush has done an awful job I Would rather when the seats that matter the\nMost important to seats that matter and deal with him in the future so I'm asking people to vote straight Republican Ramona and I went and cast votes today and we're very happy to do so um\nBut you say Ramon was there anything about our voting experience that you would like\nUs to share this for the women in front of us were very attractive eye on this happened but we had um one woman in very tight yoga pants\nI mean restricting a circulation sort of tight yoga pants and tennis shoes I'm a very muscular I'm told should I say I'm probably thirty eight year old black woman\nUm she she wasn't talking anybody though unfortunately we kept trying to make her ride make small talk\nUm the other was the what do you think that role was Hispanic\nWoman that was too in front of us\nYeah um she's very attractive and and for some reason I said something inappropriate that Ramon chest asked me for I noted to him that she had beautiful hands in addition to many of our other features and he thought that was weird\nBut you know what to each his own Lisa writes czar I live in Houston I listen to you mostly on the podcast because I Love to skip through the commercials I found you in San atone you were playing there and I got hooked\nI Love your show the dedication to the vets the adoption issues and good old fashioned common sense I also enjoy your music you're talk of food family I'm standing in line to vote at the third precinct on on worked\nThere is a flipping traffic jam in a really long line it's raining outside and it should deter people this was earlier this afternoon\nBut you can't keep determined to people down as I look around and catch the eye of others we\nTrade that knowing grand no dog whistle it's a battle cry I have a bet with my office if everyone will vote I'm making a huge part of ham with beans even if they vote the wrong side happy days sorry beta oh you're not gonna win at least the Castro\nAnd I have been enjoying receiving my emails from various listeners telling me about your experiences voting All right to the phone lines um we go bill Europe go ahead sir\n[noise] uh when I heard about the moms Springer was burning\nHi I'm calling in and say that I really believe that the package is it that it is a political thing is flat\nBrown jobs not not campaigning flak from their home care and that's not working for them\nOkay are you are not the first person to say that Dave go ahead\nSo I won't let\nYou have an open Saturday and Sunday you know it's funny you should be able to find out on Saturday you shouldn't have to go out and\nThat is correct thank you Dave I'm for those of you in Texas anyway I I don't want to speak to other states and get it wrong if you need to vote on the weekend um\nBecause for whatever reason you can't get to the polls during the week Saturday is seven eight to Seventy in Harris County anyway I Know that to be true and then Sunday has one to six you can look it up in the county in which you live the voter registrar\nThe elections officer of record in your county or perish will uh will have will post your voting location\nRemote and I went how long do you think it it didn't take long enough because we were staring at these two women in front of us we would have been happy if we could have stayed in a lot longer to be completely honest [noise] um how long\nBut Fifteen minutes I think it was less than that I think it was ten maybe ten [noise] um\nIt was really easy um I always get a lot of emails from folks on these voting machines and you know if you're convinced the voting machines are are crooked corrupt wired when that's your business or you know I'm Sorry that I don't devote enough time for you on that\nIt is true that it's a tricky little machine and it is true that you need to go slowly I admit I get a bit of anxiety when it comes to the machine because I Want to make sure that my vote is cast\nCorrectly and I suspect others do too because my vote matters I take my vote very seriously it might just be one vote but I take very seriously um my choice\nAs to who is going to fill the seat and serve in a row and I want to make sure that my voice is heard properly\nSo I Do I go through very slowly and I cast my vote and then I go back where it gives you a chance to review it and I go tedious Lee line by line by line Ramon you don't because you're waiting outside and you kind of rush through it\nYou're that kid that turns his paper into early and went through the whole thing and then cast my vote and there's a good feeling I stuck my I voted sticker on my forehead today because\nI wanted everybody to know\nAnd I think it's important I mean I don't want to get hokey but I I Do I find that to be a very important Mike Europe\nYeah hey Michael area good hey let me tell you what I Would think\nThat is most of the day before I went to vote and I'm telling you I think the whole situation is just a little bit to clean it's almost like it's a part of a psychological operations plan where it's\nOne of those if there then that thing so if the Caribbean didn't work now they try this and you notice that everyone is Bert prominent and they all ended\nUp they're supposed to target at the same time but what concerns me about all this is this is not effective\nI I I fear that it might be a democratic operative where they you know knock the prominent people that know about this but\nI think this is not effective Nancy Pelosi said it a week ago you know some there's going to be some collateral damage I fear somebody's going to get hurt at some point and this is the same party that tried to blame then got on a video tape for a while [noise]\nSo do you think it is a Democrat operative who's doing this but not to hoard Nate in at the highest levels\nI think that's exactly right I think there's some plausible deniability that kind of built in\nAnd I think that it's probably somebody who's young and likes to think they're big on strategy but those of us who've lived a long time and I've seen how some of these things work\nIs it fear I fear that there's always next step in the plant that just doesn't work then something else is already lined up and it's just to clean to have these specific individual\nTen days twelve days before election day getting these packages all at the same time and I I think that if in fact\nIf this was some not out there will have an arrest by Monday because the police and the law enforcement people looking at there are really I think they're that good and coming from the military background as myself I really think they're that good but if this is in fact an operative where political\nA game of some short where no one was ever intended to get hurt I don't think anyone is going to get arrested don't think they'll find out\nDo you think that they would have to say that last one well\nI I think that if I think the the first responders and the Alcohol Tobacco and firearms people in the ... I think they're really good stretch that if this was in fact intended to hurt somebody and really a real threat I think they'll have an arrest by next week\nDo you know I think that okay so so they're they're living on ... that you think this was orchestrated by Democrat operative do you think that anybody was intended to be harmed\nA four by ... and not well I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill work hard fighting against those tariffs during all those town hall or Colorado afraid to stand up against their own party and Claire not one of those crazy Democrat and she works right in the middle and high\nSpecially when it comes to protecting thing here in Missouri\nClaire is not one of those crazy Democrats who are the crazy Democrats just just out of curiosity where I go ahead and name them\nThat one thing and not going to run for Iraq\nBut that that people ask them all the time why haven't we run for president I Love the legislative process I I really\nDidn't know that can have a so let's talk I carry around to do it at ...\nHe's not pacing they a lot that have not that he's the ... and they have the right to put the ideas out there and that's how people around to\nNolan Europe go ahead Nolan Oh yes sir\nI'm\nI live down here a lot hotter and uh I live on the river and\nOur motives cry Republican star and I was ...\nReally I write about but you know a pack and that I then\nWorked their true facts of strong opinions here thank you wreck\nAnd it just bomb or ... years John or a bird\nAir enough Kevin Europe go ahead [laughter]\nYes I'm the whole package bomb thing just doesn't pass this test with me or the previous caller Mike I think he did a really good\nKind of analysis on on it I agree with them or\nKnow it sounds very a solid ski roles radicals cloud proven so uh you know it's the left of inciting violence and all of a sudden they're the victim so uh yes it's a false why I think it's a inside offer to\n[noise] I don't know if you are right or not but you cited a solo Lenski in his\nBook rules for radicals or revel leaf or radicals I Can't remember which one I read them both when I was in college I have a a\nProfessor told me that I should get involved in politics that that'd be good at it and then I could help the Democrats and he gave me two books rules for radicals and revel lever radicals\nAnd in one of them I think rules radicals but I guess it doesn't matter ... actually good reads and they're very powerful tools for activism\nBut one of the stories he tells a Lenski tails and ... of course was was that the hero to Morocco Obama don't like lead dismissed these people they're very effective at these sorts of things that I wanted to tell you about so one of the stories he tells\nIs a George W. Bush so the first President Bush Bush forty one [noise] he was the\nI think he was director of the CIA might've been head of the Republican Party might've been ambassador to China he he had some pretty high profile jobs several in a row he had come to campus and I want to say it was on the campus of LSU but I it doesn't matter which campus it was and he was coming to give a speech\nAnd a Lenski\nHad the a socialist students there the radicals\nHad them by outfits are fashion outfits as if they were Klan members\nAnd he had them make signs and they kept all of this quiet he had them make signs that said the KKK loves George Bush George Bush's our guy George Bush will you know carry out our agenda we love George Bush\nAnd they they got older gear on and as George Bush came across the campus Lewinsky tells the story with great glee\nAs as Bush comes across the campus to speak to the students this whole group of seeming clans members Klan members come out with all their science the media is there\nAnd they get this photo of Bush being endorsed in and cheered for by what appears to be the Klan it's actually Clarence big bee in his ilk probably a ... ... ... you don't know who's under there\nAnd Bush didn't give a speech he fled for good reason you don't need that that imagery\nAnd Elyn skied delighted in that story now when you actually consider what happened there what you're doing is you're taking very powerful images\nAnd you're taking control of them you're misusing them fraudulent Lee to give an impression\nDid we see that with ms Ford and by the way ms Ramirez and miss a who was the third was sweating ...\nIn the Kavanaugh hearings how many women by the end of it all they have him raping and running a trains on and and prostitute rings and everything else straight out of a Lenski rules\nYou take things that people care about each take those images\nPowerful images and then you misuse them make yourself into a victim and honest onlookers who can't imagine that that would have happened it's what happened to the Duke lacrosse team for that matter\nIt's what happened with to wanna Brawley and and and Al Sharpton lead that effort\nIt's what happens in these cases where you ... it's what they did with Trayvon what they did with with ah Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri\nI don't know who sent these packages I don't want to rush to judgment but I Will tell you that in talking to a lot of people today even people that are not Trump supporters are even\nRepublicans I noted a tone of skepticism in the voices of a lot of\nWe may Michael berry show you see oh\nAnd dad at solving\nThan than you\nWould eat enough of that as fond\nSaying hey that\nSaid any bank in a\n\nThe biggest Trump hopeful there was when Trump was running\nFor office he hosted Trump's favorite show with his then mistress now I think out on a girlfriend um maker\nAnd um even several points um had a hamlet moment where he would be uncertain whether he wanted to be Trump's running mate or not but he would openly discussed it he was considering\nIt not that it actually been offered but now he he's against Trump but he tweeted earlier today\nJoe Scarborough the unrelenting hatred turned up by Donald Trump for the two years following two thousand sixteen is dangerous a Washington Post columnist\nToday you know it happens it's a dirty business [noise]\nYou know\nIt just goes to show that there is often more behind the scenes of a story there's often another side to the story [noise] people are always so quick to react to a news story as if the story is thoroughly researched and\nVetted mean Ronan Farrow Ronan Farrow had built up quite a bit of capital I'm and he'd earned it\nI mean you can say what do you want about his station in life and what's been handed to him and in some of the nutty stuff he's done with NBC\nMutt he continued on he persevered through uh NBC stifling his story against Weinstein and he took on Wednesday when wind steam was was was powerful and he couldn't get NBC to carry the story so he he placed it with the New Yorker\nAnd to his credit he had to push through and there were challenges to his career over that ... that was a powerful entity to take on and it was a righteous righteous battle he was fighting and he's the one who really failed a Harvey Weinstein and and I\nGive him credit for that he deserves did he he deserved any law dettore awards or a accolades or or recognition he gets\nBut then he squandered it all\nIt's hard to build it's hard to build a reputation for integrity and perseverance tenacious listen what journalism is supposed to be but rarely is any squandered it\nHe and his Jean Myer with this with the story of the second accuser Brett Kavanaugh who turned out she wasn't even sure that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who's done what she claimed had been done to her and she couldn't even really remember what happened anyway\nAnd so but when the story yet people thought well here's story number two is not just that crazy Ford won but now now we got another woman and it's not in high school gym college this is a pattern well it wasn't a pattern you shouldn't always assume someone who's guilty\nIt turns out that people can make up things against you in trust me\nIt is very unpleasant when it happens it is nasty when it happens\nBut it also grounds you to grind through an experience like that because that's the moment at which you realize the world is not perfect justice is not always prevail\nBut you find out who you are you find out who you are in a moment like that I Would tell you\nBrett Kavanaugh is a better man today than he was when he started that here he is [noise] that doesn't mean he's a happier man doesn't mean he's a more optimistic man\nOr there's probably not a lot of Pollyanna left in in his world outlook\nBut he knows that when the chips are down when he's knocked around when\nLesser men would would ... would quit he goes Kevin wins low and goes back out there blocks\nTo more pilots catches three more passes and has to be hauled away and as the subject of the army be all you can be commercial and the win over the dolphins Tom\nYeah you get forty eight seconds go All right so Hi Michael how are you doing right go ahead good\nOkay so here's my thing I'm through everything it was going on today they were I'm Talking you know what the Democrats in their statement\nI got thinking back to when there were school shootings and such and how they never ever looked at the um psyche of the shooter or the individual that was um\nThat was taking part in that and yet they always they had a narrative which has to deal with gun control and such but it's amazing to me today how they all became second um second rate psychologist I Know exactly what this person's mindset was and where they got\nThe information from\nAnd and that's what's feeding their narrative for today [noise]\nYou did a great job managing saw\nMuch better than less miles for\nYou know the case of life [noise] Michael berry you oh [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Berry", "city": "Nashville", "day": "25"}
