there's two there's two things that people here want one is is she's grown person and you know we don't tell her grown kids what to do we merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what I Do something\nTo what I participate in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown\nAnd the answer to that would be no and you are working to get out of debt your son is working to get out of that you guys are made the decision that being in debt on cars and these other things is a bad idea it's not good for your finances and to turn around and put her in dead or participate in activity\nIt's not an act of love so I'm I appreciate her sentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she's right but as your\nMom if I'm Ninety and you're eighty five and you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing you harm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that and ah and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right to be mad or you have the right\nTo think that I'm On line but I'm just cannot in good conscience participate in an activity that's not good for you I Love you\nKnow\nI wouldn't sell it to her okay if\nI were in power in your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them came to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in this thing that that did I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do it they should buy five thousand dollar carpet cash for it\nMhm\nNow how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI mean we have a hundred dollars a day and what is your house on a one eighty\nOkay so how quickly are you going to have the hundred thousand page do you think\nWe're looking at two years that's\nAbout as long as there should take max the fifty a year making one eighties not exactly\nSo deeply deeply sacrificing I'm now given all of those numbers four thousand dollars\nDoesn't matter much you could just show or the car for four or five thousand okay\nAnd not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into debt I'm not going to participate in that activity okay\nBut if you want to sell it to our country and just help her\nUm because the four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much out of a hundred you follow me or what moves the need a lot of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared this debt really really fast so given those numbers I might\nGive up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay cash five thousand you can have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into that\nYou're going to have if you're gonna do that you're going to do it somewhere else 'cause I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and that's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's\nI'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that\nBrings you harm because I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are option little rebellious ... seriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear love coming from you that way\nThen there's something wrong but I in your case what the numbers I might if you're on your show it to them cheap that's okay too but he didn't want is fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us in Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] well I've been listening\nTo you for a couple of weeks and I'll bet that nice started filling out college applications that my daughter my son's already in college in\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him into much debt already he's in two years\nThat he started his second year of school and my daughter was like I said in the fall but he already has like ten thousand dollars and a\nAnd school grounds and then we have fourteen thousand and apparent pie phone [noise] mhm\nAnd so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing and how do I get them through college\nWhere is he in school ah Washington state University in ... what is the tuition\n[noise] ah about well the first year at twenty seven oh tuition it is um [noise] around [noise] I Can't even think\nTwelve eight twelve thousand okay tough that probably pretty close I might get a little off\nBut it should be about there in state tuition at school or something like that the national average is about ten but I think Washington's a little bit higher okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus\nNo he's not living on campus you're nothing in our house trade paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay is it working\nYes he works about twenty five hours per week right now but it does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good [noise] okay and we got to get him on a really really tight budget immunity to be applying for scholarships left and right yeah you guys helped him sit down and figure out what you can contribute\nTo the equation so between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really are and the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can\nPull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and don't add any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had the third we have a car loan where\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I've got he's got that parent PLUS Loan now do I start hammering on the parent PLUS Loan or do a camera and the car loan Carla\nA car loan and then the parent plus on yes okay because I didn't know if that can ... you know when you go down your um [noise] yeah\nI didn't know investor kids with\nThis number five but we're not investing for now trying to cash flow with them yeah help him get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of saving for college or trying to get through college now\nAnd then my daughter who's starting in the fall she is selling out scholarship she does have we do have some money you know not much but a little bit of money saved sure I'm\nGood just work like an animal and she has only out like ten scholarship applications a day\nAnd again she chooses an inexpensive school the least expensive option possible because you guys are broke and you're trying to hold us together as a family and get these two kids through school it can be done but it's going to require a lot of work a lot of scholarships and choosing the inexpensive school option\nAnd there was no shame in that game and\nSome people do it every day and other people go a hundred\nThat puts this hour day Ramsey showing the bugs and we got way for you know what it means um remember there's ultimately only one way to be and that's the one day with the prince of peace prize ...\nSays he pretty certain ... hey this hours

under\nCountry county run hospitals\nMy two thirds of the babies born in county run hospitals\nAre born to illegal alien mothers who thirds almost Seventy percent\nWell if we understand that obstetrics care is an expensive undertaking and if we understand the counties are absorbing this cost\n[noise] that would mean let's take the emotion out of it for a moment that if illegal alien women were not giving birth in this country but instead and the country where they are a citizen\nIf they were not flopping that cost on to the American taxpayer than two thirds of the opposite that trick budget ... county hospitals could be eliminated\nWhat could counties do with that amount of money\nIf you add to that neo natal care obstetrics care early childhood care\nIf you were to pull out from American health care costs the costs imposed by illegal aliens\nAnd you are to tally that number and show the American taxpayer that if we enforce our laws this would be the annual savings and then you compare that number to all the things we don't currently do because they always tell you there's not enough money\n[noise]\nI'm not trying to be callous trying to be mean I'm not against any particular group sure we have more illegal aliens coming to this country from what they know countries than others that's basically a function of the fact that they live on a contiguous attractive land if we live next door to Africa\nI can assure you we would have far more illegal aliens because the people of Africa are far poor\nThey just can't get here\nAnd in fact the argument that we're somehow being kind to the people of Mexico Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and not doing so is not fair if you want to know what's not fair what's not fair is that the Africans who are much poorer in much worse shape\nCan't manage to get here illegally because they would [noise] that's what's not fair [noise]\nThey lost the location lottery [noise] that that's not fair\nPossible health introducing
