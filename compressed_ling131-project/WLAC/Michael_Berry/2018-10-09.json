Hawaii I'll get all these out a Hi Connie how are you\n... thank you very much for taking my call sure how can I help\nI'm Wondering what\nAdvice you'd have to make it in a place where the cost of housing so astronomical\nYou have to make an astronomical income right\nBecause you don't get a pass on math if you live in Hawaii California or Manhattan math is still math and so if you buy something you can't afford it'll still bankrupt you write\nRight shoulder you\nKnow ... or so the problem and the problem is dramatic\nAh for a guy like you who probably is a a a native Hawaiian and probably your grandfather and grandmother were and uh it's all you've ever known and yet the housing prices on the islands have made it where a regular working man can hardly afford to live there\nYeah with this like Silicon Valley right I mean you can't afford to let you can afford to work in Silicon valley but you can't afford to live there you have to live the forty five miles away an hour and a half commute to be able to afford a house their problem is you can't move that far out 'cause you have this thing called an ocean [laughter]\nCan't move that far out of town and it gets wet yeah but I I don't know I mean are there areas I Know why who in Maui and of course the big islands got its own issues right now but a little volcano action but the uh I Know a ... who in Mali are outrageous are the other islands\nI think I think so I mean I think I Would probably have a lot of places that you know somebody could um afford a but the problem is typically like you said it's like it\nIt's an hour now could be even though we're on an island and you only got to drive Fifteen or twenty miles with the worst traffic of the nation\nAs a two lane road it's a beautiful view but you get to enjoy the view yeah right\nOr the neighbor or they're not you know you might not necessarily want to read if there are\nRight right okay so there is some options along those lines um then I you know there's not a magic answer to what I don't want you to do and that's why I started the answer the way I started to what I don't want to do is just give yourself permission to do something that's harmful to you\nJust because it just because it's expensive and you throw up your hands go well just the way it is and they rooms you just doesn't understand was not me it's math I mean math still a problem when your house payment is sixty percent of your take home pay because real estate's expensive\nYou're going to go bankrupt I mean you're not going to make it your kids aren't going to college are going to struggle financially you're gonna struggle you can't keep that from happening and so you've got to you gotta you gotta bite the bullet into a neighborhood you don't love a commute you don't love or make some other arrangements um\nOr honestly truthfully what happens is uh are you Silicon Valley as an example 'cause it was just reading an article about the other day\nThe number of people that have left is absolutely amazing 'cause they just yeah and then they're having the bus they're bussing service workers in\nBecause they can't afford to live the bus or a man and you know some of the ski resorts face the same thing they build housing for the workers because it's the only way they can get somebody to stay there because you can't afford to live in Aspen\nAnd work in Aspen as a as a ... you know as a ski patrol guide right you can't afford it is to expand right and so it's the same kind of an economic issue on these micro ... economic situations but you know you cannot it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan and make less than a hundred grand\nYou're right it just met him mathematically very tough and so you end up cross in one of the bridges I'm ... and living out in one of the other boroughs um and in order to get your costs down enough to actually survive and live your dream of being there\nSo I'm hopefully you can find a way to you know mix in the neighborhood idea and the commute idea\nEnough to get a value that works for you do for a living\nAnd I am a firefighter okay well as a part time on the flight attendants\nOkay cool and are you married yes what's your wife do\nRight now she pretty much stayed at home with the\nKids how many kids I'm too We're two under two no fun and what your household income\nYeah I'm

a side there's the post\nTo be in favor of voter registration but they are left leaning organization and coming out against a candidate coming out against the nominee like this first of all the fact that they even took a side no matter what the side is\nIs offensive but even more offensive is the fact that they joined in as if Brett Kavanaugh is some rapist and I got to tell you something\nYou don't just get to call somebody a rapist and then when you lose the vote we all go are are different directions by the way ms forward the original accuser\nHer lawyer who was a handed to her by Dianne Feinstein we still don't know who's paying them they've decided that they're going to drop the matter they don't they don't want to uh but they don't want to bother with it anymore I asked Sandy Peterson our research director\nI said could you just make a list of some of the topics that we discussed over the last month\nBecause you'll remember the left was coming out as fast\nAnd furious [noise] they were they were making a different claim per day do you remember when the hearing started\n[noise] judge Kavanaugh's law clerk was sitting over his shoulder sitting beside ... behind him and she was holding her hand on her on the uh the bend in her elbow\nAnd she had her three fingers her middle finger her ring finger enter pinky out the kind of grasping the elbow itself\nThe index finger was in the Wii of her arm and the some was resting on top of the forearm along with the index finger\nAnd it was kind of class being there so that she could put those two together maybe apply pressure low low relief that she probably didn't even know she was doing\nThey saw that video that picture and the left made that out that she was flashing a white power symbol on national TV\n[noise] that was a dog whistle to the white power community you remember that that poor woman was caught up in all of that nonsense\nThat's where we started before they started the rape accusations and all I just want to go through a few things that they pulled to kind of reminds you of what they did [noise]\nIf it is the Michael Bay self\nConfidence an optimism about the future [noise] one of the main things that she has done is to give them a little bit of hope today one in\nLived in poverty by working together the picture poverty can change for easy ways even poverty down on a message from the

already screaming at people in public and ducks ing them and staking out their homes what does it look like for them to fight all the harder\nThis is in reference to the fact\nThat several liberal left the commentators over the weekend declared that having lost the ... the the Kavanaugh battle\nDemocrats and the left rather than learning their lesson rather than respecting the institutions and allowing them to work made references to taking the gloves off roof ...\nThat they need to be more ruthless was a word that was used several times\nSo ... east coast there is a dangerous an irresponsible strain of opinion telling the Democrat Party today that when they lose it's because they are fighting hard enough\nShould we pretend this hasn't happened before\nI give you the answer from Harry Reid to the question quote aren't you worried Republicans will get rid of the filibuster on the Supreme Court the majority is the majority but does that majority really have overwhelming political ... power enough to crush the presumed cultural dominance of the left\nWell what does cultural dominance even mean does it mean people start listening to late night host for their political guidance does it mean they start heating the words of Hollywood at the Emmys or the Oscars\nDoes it mean when Taylor Swift takes the Instagram to endorse a guy who would be the oldest white man in history elected as a true freshman to the Senate it should last launch a million young female voters to support him over a woman\nThat's not how this works it never has\n[noise] if the right really did have overwhelming political power\nIt would be running roughshod outside of the realm of taxes and regulation it's hard to see that Obamacare still mostly the law the land Planned Parenthood still mostly funded education policy still nibbling at the edges of reform curbing public sector unions is limited to a few states\nRepublicans success in New England and Marilyn and elsewhere has led to the election of quite a few governors but where's their big achievement besides managing things a little more cheaply\nWhat this whole we're the wet rag party talk really translates to is we the abiding leave secular Americans who were repeatedly promised we were the ethnically and sexually diverse and dominant coalition during the Obama years now feel frustrated by being nearly ascendant\nAnd feel instead entitled to absolute and immediate victory\nAnd that justifies the we're coming for you attitude today because any road blocks or speed bumps for that agenda or now viewed as the vestiges of debt old white men protecting the interest of modern\nOld white men\nThis was a surprisingly dominant viewpoint as recently as a few years ago accepted even among intelligent people on the right than a surprising group of people came along willing to say no\nAnd that has made all the difference [noise]\n[noise] you know what made all the difference in the Kavanaugh fight there was a moment along the way when I saw a number of Republicans\nSay it's time\nThat Kavanaugh withdraw for the good of himself his family the Trump presidency the Republican brand and the court to which he would be serving its time he withdraw\nThat was that was the message that is the ... that\nIs the ... at the core of Republicans\nThe fear of the fight\nIf Trump has done one thing more than any other in his time as president and ascending to the presidency\nIs is that he has taught Republicans that it's okay to push back it's okay to believe something deeply enough that when they accuse you of the worst intentions\nYou keep fighting when they hit you hit back you don't run and hide you\nDon't walk away because what they do the first time when they succeed they'll do in spades because it works it's why you don't settle lawsuits 'cause they bring on more\nIt's why you don't give him the bullies because you encourage bullying swat Neville Chamberlain was ridiculed by history for his appeasement of Hitler because it didn't appease Hitler\nIt fed him it increased his appetite and when you\nGive in to the left when you let them have their way when you walk away from the fight they bring [noise] you're going to have a bigger fight weight and down the road\nYou've got a Michael berry show [noise]\n\nA job to make me\nThink most of us are ready to move on me on TALK of sexual harassment\nAnd high school beer drinking and what you wrote in your\nHigh school yearbook and whether that's supposed to be some code ... most of us are ready to move on from that not particularly productive talk and frankly it should have never come up but I Do want to address something\nI have had more conversations about Kavanaugh confirmation process\nThan I have most any political issue in quite some time going back to the two thousand sixteen primaries actually\nOne of the things I noticed was how many women it's actually over half of the women with whom I talked about the Kavanaugh hearings\nClaimed to be a victim\nOf sexual assault not just sexual harassment sexual assault\nAnd\nThat's an interesting phenomena I'm not saying it's not true I'm not saying even one of them made it up I'm saying that if it is true if it is true\nAh first of all it's a real problem in our society\nHere is the problem here here is the conundrum the dilemma this is a very difficult discussion to half\nBy design there are people who have complicated this conversation and made it difficult to talk openly about it and it is unhealthy as a society\nTo put your head in the sand and say well we just won't talk about it because it will upset people\nThat the left has been more on hinged under Trump\nThan I recall in my lifetime in my lifetime\nAnd and I think that includes a during Watergate in my lifetime I mean I I I don't claim I could process what happened in the Watergate I'm I'm reading from from historical sources but I'm\nIn my lifetime I don't recall the left being as angry or bitter and vicious as they have been toward everything Trump and yet he just got his second Supreme Court nominee on on the bench\nMany incredible miraculous things that President Trump has died and this is nothing short of America when he's got done what he's done it in the face of constant\nWarning and lying and ... feral attacks on him and his first and then his people they're chasing his cabinet members and staff at a restaurant they're sending their sending at a private information and senator he has expose the hypocrisy and the and that the two\nOf the loyal opposition dining deck in that senator ... people are tuning in and\nThey say these people I'm like who is this\nBlumenthal guy who's ... or ... or ... or their Allison who is what is the standard we don't even rather than here why are offering being beat up and give medical records and you know cooperation on Brett Kavanaugh and you're just blowing up his life\nAnd I don't like really transcends politics\nI think that's true\nI think that's ... that's absolutely true her husband I'm James Carville\nMitt for Donald Trump when when Ted Cruz first went in the Senate when Ted Cruz shut down the government fighting against Obamacare James Carville had this to say about him\nI think as talented has failed to Republican politicians I've seen in the last Thirty years after the fact that he's going to run for president and he is going to create something I'm not saying is that he's got to win and I think that matters right I\nTo listen to access on the stage and South Carolina he touches every button and this guy has no fear\nHe just keeps piling ahead and and he is going to be something to watch in in a lot of Republicans feel this way going and you hear this a lot if we only got someone who was a ... and ... we ... we went all that kind of we get these John McCain's these Mitt Romney's and these guys had to say well one thing this guy's not his way\nAnd that is true one thing Romney is he is squishy and McCain was ... and that's why they lost to Obama and I said this morning I'll say it again what Donald Trump has taught Republicans to do is to fight\nWhat he's taught them to do is to play to win\nDon't just show up and keep your uniform clean don't be proud of what a nice team picture you can take after the game because you have no dirt\nOn your leg in ... as you look like you didn't you never slid into the base leave it all on the field\nWhat Trump has talked Republicans to do is what the left has been doing for a long time and that is played a win win\nThere was a moment when Kavanaugh look like his candidacy his nomination was in peril\nIt looked like it would just be easier for him to step back and there were a number of folks Bill Kristol the editor of the Weekly Standard there were a lot of those folks a lot of the Georgetown salon Republicans who said let's just pulled his back\nIs it that this has gotten to ugly it's gotten too ugly to nasty and I'm a ... it did let's just let's just pull this thing back\nWe don't we don't need to ah we don't need to win this\nOr this much ... it's a ... it's bad for the court bad for the Trump presidency is bad for the Republican brand you know I Will say this I mean it deserves to be said\n[noise] I have\nBeen absolutely profound respect for the way that Mitch McConnell handled this process\nI have an in during the ... the amount\nOf respect\nIn the last time they see something just to clean up\nVery good Rebecca dances with wolves was historically inaccurate okay who else yes calling how badly all practice\nIndian giving oh yeah that's a good idea\nNo I don't really think you're getting this some who else Scott\nWe can give each other Indian banks were not giving each other Indian burns but it's very offensive yes go ahead please people we don't like and hope they get sick and die\nYou know once again we are not giving up one gets to the kids we don't like come on we're trying to redefine the Christopher Columbus holiday what are some other ideas Samantha\nTo elect a question about the fact that people can still walk or gay stuff\n[laughter]\nI'm close I mean better anyone else oh Jim all do you have any ideas teacher must play pin on the white man\n[noise] All right kids than is the research has found now you can only run outside and not play on the swings [laughter]\n\nThe president today flew to Florida with Rod Rosenstein into the pool reporter who was there as the the way this works as a pool reporter is chosen from the press pool\nTo be the one reporter and then they share with the rest of the press so they can go off and report that way you don't have to have all of them there that it was um\nAbout a thirty to forty five minute conversation\nUm and that it covered border security protection of law enforcement\nAnd other general de OJ issues I think was the term that you know Rosenstein is the deputy attorney general and the guy who's been expecting to be fired for quite some time\nAnd the palace intrigue that Donald Trump has created over whether or not he's going to fire Rosenstein or not is nothing short of delightful and delicious\nTrump has them on their on the edge of their seats\nAbsolutely on the edge of their seats and he's got them on the verge of being fired at all times and he knows what he's doing he publicized is when he's going to be meeting with him\nWhen he was up at the un was that last Thursday or Thursday before [laughter] if you were just managing media cycles\nYou're going to have three or four major news stories in one day in the Trump Administration in what would have been more news than you'd have in a month under most presidents\nAnd of course there was something of a of a news embargo under Obama if it was a news story the press felt that would make you like him less maybe just choose not to cover it they would smother those stories\nUnder Trump they're out creating those stories and he understands that game so well that what he does is he gives them other stories he gives them side stories it's sort of like well\nThere was a story about one of my favorite college football coaches Mike Leach\nAnd back he's at Washington state now but back in the day\nIs he at Washington state or Washington I think it's Washington state in it just Washington you sure check that I think is Washington state [noise] but when he was a when he was at\nOklahoma [noise] um\nI think the year was night he Ninety nine is Washington state yeah OK when he was in Oklahoma they were playing the University of Texas to big red river shootout\nAnd he created this fake off insist scheme the first few plays that the ... was going to be running\nAnd he accidentally drop drip on the ground and didn't notice he dropped it and let the uh assistant coaches for the University of Texas pick it up so they planned their defense because they couldn't believe this treasure trove had been dropped on them\nThey plan their defense they they they went ahead and cold air defenses schemes for the first few plays around defeating what the ... was going to do but leach always two steps ahead\nHad actually created a set of plays that if you defended those plays the way he knew they would defend them it would actually\nLeave his guys wide open for the plays he actually called so his team went up Seventeen nothing over the University of Texas before the UT coaches realized we've been had that's what Trump is doing\nOn many occasions he is creating a situation he is creating a potential conflict\nBecause they know they they live the media lives to cover that conflict Trump is creating a potential conflict and then he doesn't deliver the conflict\nHe he does something other than deliver that conflict Fox News\nWas reporting as well CNN I Can't remember if it was last Thursday or the Thursday before it's today the president was sharing the um U.N Security council meeting\nWhich was a very eventful substantive news day and yet they covered Kevin all the whole time you know we could probably spend a couple of shows\nTalking about what Trump has done in the last month that I'll bet you most people don't know anything about\nCanada signing on to an updated NAFTA to point out on our terms when they were they wouldn't that's consequential that's meaningful that is a victory for Trump and that's why they don't talk about\nThat is a victory for Trump on a serious serious foreign policy issue\nRelations with North Korea and peace on the Korean Peninsula you know when it when it first started when that process first started it looked like it was going to develop do you remember what they told us [noise] Trump was going to drag us into a war\nIn North Korea [noise] not only are we not in a war there that region is way\nSafer than it's been in forty years think\nAbout that that's that's a huge accomplishment\nSo the ... [laughter]\nLA see oh\nWe lack boots and\nOr mayors headway either\nYou know partly India is done and fun Fred\n... is a guy who\nUh is is really in my opinion is really funny he's a good sketch writer a he's a talented a comic and Kerry brown stain is probably what I just said about Fred Thompson times too\nAnd they poke fun at Portland's people", "show_name": "Michael Berry", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "09"}
