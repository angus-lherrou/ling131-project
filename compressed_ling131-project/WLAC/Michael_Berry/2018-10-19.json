computer in our ... what else they rely on yeah in the energy arena um\nWhich seats eight thousand and I guess the response was pretty was pretty intense and so they have moved that to the Toyota Center\nAnd so uh that's what's going to be happening and that will be this coming Monday now\nFor those you don't know there's nothing more embarrassing than an empty arena for a political speech it suggests that there's no momentum so they wouldn't have moved to this big massive\nArena where the Houston Rockets play unless they knew they had the crowd\nSo and I've had a lot of people tell me um that they are um\nThat they're going to it so uh that that is kind of in keeping with what we already expected so that news a little hot off the press for the Houston crowd and that will be a that'll be President Trump\nIntroducing a A R herb endorsing ... introducing a speaking a bragging on a I'm\nA Senator Ted Cruz sorry for these things are just coming across the table or I just got news sat

president\nTrump's big rally for Ted Cruz you know I'll tell you\nI'm\nThe momentum\nFor Senator Cruz right now\nIs so intense now I'm a Homer I I Am not to be trusted on this issue a I'm a very close personal friend Ted Cruz and hadn't been for Twenty years and I am not objective when it comes to him I'm a ... if you don't know if you're new to the show ... you didn't\nJust no I'm not objective when it comes to Ted Cruz\nHowever I'm going to tell you because it's true\nUm the momentum for his campaign has hit at exactly the right time\nThere was a lawyer in Houston named John Hill\nAnd John Hill had run for governor in Texas in Nineteen Seventy eight and he had defeated ... Briscoe who was the Democrat governor he defeated him in the Democratic primary\nAnd it was a huge coup this young guy had done this\nAnd then he managed to lose in the general election to bill Clements\nAnd when I was running for city council even though he was he'd been a democratic kind of sort of grew more and more conservative as he got older and he supported me and my racist\nBut he told me I I was campaigning twenty four seven in February for a November election and he said I\nCan't I worked so hard to win the nomination to get the Democrat nomination my biggest victory was in defeating the ... the governor who was in my party that I ran out of gas about a month before the election\nHe said if you'd have viewed have polled are held the election a month earlier out of one view they held a two months earlier I Won a landslide he said I didn't get the right time and it's hard to know how to do that\nBut I'm going to tell you\nRepublicans are peaking at just the right time and\nIt is a it is exciting to see I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna give you an example here so the house five\nThirty eight which is one of the well respected polling shops but they've been wrong before yesterday gave an eighty three point nine percent so eighty four percent chance\nFive and six chance that the Democrats take the house I had somebody asked me that lost that well what does that mean what does it what what are the what is the effect of that happening\nI said well\nIt means that President Trump will spend the next two years being\nIn Maine locked in a war with the house of representatives it means congressional committees it means every resource they have\nTying up President Trump it means a you'll still get your Supreme Court justices through but it Means Committee hearings it means dominating the news cycle\nIt means that for two years he can't get the appropriations the money he needs for anything that's what it means and it's not good\nAnd it's why we have got to when I'm endorsing John Culberson a Republican congressmen here in the seventh congressional district now over the years I had been hard on John Culberson when I didn't think he was being sufficiently conservative\nBut I'm telling you I Am going to work to help him win because if he wins it means the Democrats don't get that vote for Nancy Pelosi\nAnd it is easy to forget how bad it was in this country with Nancy Pelosi as speaker of our house and that is exactly what would happen\n[noise] I Do not want Nancy Pelosi and her ilk Sheila Jackson Lee and ally running the house of representatives and that's what happens if Lizzie Fletcher wins\nWe have had to say that you can find out what is a minute [noise]\nCars cigars and if you saw from\nOur library\nAnd have to sign in his\nPainting is I Know my\nOn and\nKnees in\nNa na\nSean Hannity on Rush Limbaugh on his program to mind for the entirety of the hour\nAccording to the Washington Times the to quote would chat for a full hour about President Trump the midterm elections and the ever changing prism a vital information political and otherwise\nAnd a talkers magazine says this is noteworthy because Limbaugh does not make a habit of appearing on other people's programs in fact he doesn't typically do this and he is very particular about making ... TV appearances and the first place\nOf marriage and what you think makes a good marriage have you discussed love have you discussed sex have you discussed drugs you discuss your own failings and the things that you were most proud of either an honest man are\nAge appropriate because if you haven't you haven't shared with your child the things that you can share\nThat will make the biggest difference [noise] far more important\nThan a savings account you're maintaining for them to go to college and learn these things from some professor [noise] share who you are [noise]\nFaces the Michael very show [noise]\n[noise]\nYou do there Bob and talk about a blue wave in November\nWork for you and I talk about that time on the mark\nWas that was going to be brew I Would make ... figure of the house she's better suited for the lack of spring or the kitchen [laughter] ...\nMan that would leave finger Paul Ryan as a man in the house in the last time I say he's Republican cohort\nHey what's up with those lip is that like a herpes on top of his face herself that he's a liar and also I Know is the ability to write a skateboard does not make warning to senator oh maybe\nThe Tony Hawk would be the most awesome center ever\nThat there is a ... skate rat but they do is vanished were closer and and that's all that drunk driving Charlotte may and is\nThat ... story was a that was a lie it never happened or totally made up next thing is Democrats are violent or was that when this is going to have the fifty ... there are serious like a two year old pitching a tantrum fit\nPretty soon we're going to gather all up and put them in like a great big cap so they could kind of get re educated on what may be American Pie by saying it's Stormy Daniels as I hate to admit it but she's a favor a woman in the news is all tied up inside a sex scandal submitted to Seattle horses place\nFor like a solid month 'cause I always thought she looked exactly like a horse I remember Mr Ed can you imagine a storm and those are words actually misread instead of Mr Ed was Mr Ed there'd be like oh what was the horrors of course of course\nSleeps with a horse of course although of course you are the horse horse face Stormy Daniels big face fourth woman\nI like to be heard jockey if you catch on my drift of okay that's all I got I have a blessed day anyhow [noise]\n[noise] the projection with the Democrats\nIs getting really scary\nAnother day another Democrat assaults Republican the female campaign manager for Nevada Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam lack salt was assaulted by Mike Stark an operative with the George Soros funded\nAmerican twenty first century bridge\nOn Tuesday [noise] stark fifty was arrested by Las Vegas city marshals Tuesday evening after thirty one year old Christian Davis and said he grabbed and twisted her arm refusing to let go\nShe told Fox News this man was physically almost body checking me I was getting nervous for my safety so we left in went into an open room she said stark tried to follow her and the gubernatorial candidate ... and other staffers into the second room\nHe grabbed my right arm my leg was lodged between the door in the wall the twisted my arm and contorted it behind my back I was scared Everytime I tried pulling away would grab tighter pulled me closer to him\nDavis instead start pulled her head into his chest bruising her neck and held are there for several minutes she said it felt like an hour [noise]\nShe said she was scared screaming stop you're hurting me Davis and said start Warren ...\nSaying quote Adam is only one way you can make this stop that really scared me she said\nThat is sick that is it\nFox News reported that this is not the man's first run in with police for disorderly conduct around Republicans he was arrested in October of Seventeen for disorderly conduct while at a campaign rally in\nVirginia for Ed Gillespie he was also arrested earlier this year for assaulting another woman interior secretary Ryan Zinke his press secretary Heather swift after a budget hearing before a house committee\nAdam ... who is the public and gubernatorial candidate his spokesman Parker bride instead according to Fox News assaulting the female campaign manager of the is opposing campaign is disgusting and has no place in our system this mob behavior from the left us out of control\nEncouraging violence as many prominent Democrats like former attorney general Eric Holder have recently done it's having real dangerous consequences\nStark has since been fired from the Democratic group that was\n[noise] employing him\nThis thing you can continue the Democrats continue is your article today\nAccording to the latest polls she's no longer up on Kevin daily on by thirty three percentage points she's only up on him by about fourteen but here's the problem\nShe doesn't crack forty percent\nReal clear politics average ... thirty eight point three to daily ... twenty four point seven\nIs a whole lot of Californians who have not made up their minds and probably won't until election day\nSo that means that only about sixty two sixty three sixty four percent less than two thirds fewer than two thirds of Californians have made up their minds\nI Will tell you Twenty years in politics and reading polls\nIncumbents tend to peak\nIn the early polls because their name id is that close to a hundred percent everybody knows who they are\nIf you see an incumbent in an early poll with a high name id Ninety percent or above\nBut doesn't approach high numbers in terms of percentage of votes they're winning that is a signal that a credible candidate can potentially beat them\nWith Feinstein she's widely known she's been the senator of California for four hundred years so they know who she is\nAnd yet they're not saying they're going to vote for her now they're not saying they're going to vote for her opposition either and he's a Democrat far\nMore liberal than she is but if they're not willing to commit to her it means they are willing to consider an alternative\nAnd that's a third of the voters who are willing to consider an alternative so if you got thirty six percent still out there floating\nIn your ... twenty five percent you got to win twenty five thirty six which means you gotta you gotta win two thirds of the remaining voters\nBut it's possible it's not crazy because they're not with are already\nThe polling was not even on likely voters it was on adults and registered voters survey usa interviewed twelve hundred California adults from friday through Sunday so any work that she may have done during the Kavanaugh hearing to bolster\nHer her image which was what most of us thought she was doing was simply trying to build her numbers she didn't want that fight she wasn't in the Kavanaugh fight\nHer heart wasn't in it but she had to be if she wanted that cabin I'll Fight she would have started to fight earlier she would have been more strategic about it\nNow I suppose you could say well by waiting till the very end she got the most bang for the buck most folks are suggesting that she's not the one who actually made it public\nAnd I'm not convinced she necessarily wanted to make it public I think she had a pretty good sense it might be a loser of an issue she was box into\nA corner damned if she didn't damned if she didn't because if she doesn't bring the Ford allegation forward when it showed up on her doorstep she was the one who found out about\nThen she catches heat\nBecause you sat on this you could have protected this woman who's a victim but if she does bring it forward which in effect as what happened\nNow it's hung around her neck she made a clown of herself she be clown her so she ended up looking like a fool\nNow I don't know California the fruits and nuts that are California Democrats I don't know in their minds if she came awful looking better or worse for what she did 'cause I don't know how they I don't understand how these people saying\nBut out of twelve hundred adults that were poll from friday through Sunday nine hundred and sixty four of them were registered to vote seven hundred sixty two had already voted\nOr we're likely to do so before November six this could get very very interesting\nMeanwhile in\nTexas well before we get to that meanwhile former vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine Democrat whose son has been arrested as a member of antifa is telling Democrats to fight in the streets\nWhat we've got to do his fight in Congress fight in the courts fight in the streets fight online fight at the ballot box and now there is that momentum to be able to do this and we're not afraid of the popular outcry we're energized ...\nOK\nOkay then um [noise]\nYour energized by the fight we've\nGot a video up at Michael berry dot com of a Ted ... of a a ... supporter who is tearing up Ted Cruz yard signs and he is not\n[noise]\nHe's absolutely nuts you got to see the video of this guy\nThis this this is a beta or support if ever there was one [noise]\nI'm ready to vote man I think people are ready to vote I Want\nI'm ready for people to have a say\nTo say we have had enough of your mob violence [noise]\nHad enough of your impeaching Trump tall\nCommunist doing well we like where the country is right now we're tired of antifa\nTired of black lives matter we're tired of Palin cabernet\nTired of nonsense you see\nSeeing what you stand\n\n\nThe only result when it comes time that it really matters you've\nHeard it so long that to me out I Want it to be fresh I Want to leave a mark or get your attention and shake you for a minute so when we go into this political Tom I'm focus on politics more than I typically am\nBut one of the things I Hope you get from the show you around is a coal to be not a better person because of course we're all trying to be a better person but a coal to be the person you would actually like to be\n[noise]

painful pangs\nOf hunger sacrificed discipline effort not an easy thing to do but remote knew he had that in him he knew he could do it but for how many years had he not done it\nHe had to make a decision I'm going to do this I can do this I Will do this and he had to get up every day consistently and sustain that and at a moment of weakness when he was hungry he had to say I'm not going to do it\nI was going to keep pushing through gonna keep crime I like to work grad 'cause I find that people that are highly successful understand most of us don't\nShow up for a Prize Fight and then show up six months later for prospects [noise] most of us achieve excellence [noise]\nOne step at a time on them and we get a\nPushed through the hunger pushed through the sleep and\nPushed through the distraction\nAnd we pushed through that morning that minute [noise]\nHalf day that day [noise]\nFor you know what you call one on top of the other a series of good decisions that lead to a great was

what the pollsters say it's hard for me to believe because an echo chamber I live in\nAh\nThe nutty wacky left has really really turn people off and the never\nTrump or ... who are Republicans are saying you know I think I think I can find in my heart to go ahead than uh uh to go ahead and and be\nThe interests of northern Minnesota throughout the race which is why he failed to maintain the wide support of his former boss\nStall borough the Republican his spokesman Caroline tar with said Joe ridden of H is clearly being rejected by Minnesota voters it's no wonder Democrat allies are cutting and running from him\nStole over the Republican as focus on local issues of importance to the area it's a mining area\nHe's even bucking Republican trends by coming out against right to work legislation would just kind of a big deal in an area where the United mine workers dominate\nAnd attracting support from beyond Donald Trump's base which overwhelmingly supported the president and two thousand sixteen\nEven as it sent the Democrat Nolan to Congress\nRepublican aligned groups have flooded the district since August fifteenth primary highlighting the Democrat or a den of it just unpaid parking tickets and building a strong ground game\nWhile the Democrats may have pulled their funding the GOP says it will stick around and focus on get out the vote efforts\n\nFolks if you are passionate about this election as I Know many of you are and I'm telling you there are years that I pay attention\nAnd then there are times I get really excited and I got to tell you I'm really excited about this one\nI'm really excited to say you know that investigation that you've been doing it in the Trump\nWhile Trump's been doing really good things as president\nI Want to validate that I Want to send a message that I like the direction we're headed him\nI like what's happening with the stock market\nI like what's happening with our economy I like what's happening is see if I can pull this up ahead I report came out earlier today about let's see here weekly unemployment numbers\nAt this point in the Obama presidency the media kept focusing on how a new unexpected\nThe employment number were\nBecause they were really bad it was really unexpected why is it just just unexpected result of his policies\nSo the media doesn't really report on unemployment anymore but it's still uses the term unexpectedly as in first time unemployment claims fell unexpectedly last week Breitbart reports\nUnemployment claims fell by more than expected last week indicating that the trade war with China and protective tariffs on steel and aluminum\nHave not Wade on jobs new applications for state unemployment benefits fell by five thousand to a seasonally adjusted two hundred ten

got her from yeah and they hit the ball I've thought they called it a double then they started review and I thought they're going to call the home run and they say that and I said what they do is that you know\nMy heart went out to the gap in my heart absolute went up to the guy\nYeah I mean what I Would do the same thing you have your balls coming out you're a human is thinking reached you protect yourself well\nI'm not going to lie I like the guys that take off all their clothes and straight across the field I find that to be funny but he didn't do that I mean this guy wasn't trying to interrupt the game he's a fan and you know I heard people all day long say\nWell you shouldn't have the seats that close to the action men don't forget there is no action without the fan\nThat's right yeah they're paying the bills they're vital rise above lawyers\nDo you ever forget that it's that you just have a warehouse full of furniture if people didn't come in and want to buy them so that those customers was worse than it is and you say that all I've seen you firing up your troops it's all about those people come and do the door not us not this furniture\nDog matters if ... it's a and that's the customer and that's why the unique things or baseball you're close to the action the what people want to be they don't want to be removed\nI Will tell you I'm I don't know how big a basketball fan you are but um\nWhen Spike Lee would get into what Reggie Miller I'm a huge Reggie Miller fan but uh uh Reggie Miller would do the chokes on Spike Lee and Spike Lee was kind of in\nThe game right he was down on the he was on the front row but he was in the game and that intensity drove Reggie Miller to be better there are times now sometimes you know you get a ... fan it it can ruin it for everybody but sometimes that kind of interaction particularly a famous person being there\nAnd it just makes a difference in the world there's a story about Joe Montana 'em and they're getting ready to to drive down and and scored the winning touchdown you know the story\nHe turns to Dwight Clark and he goes hey that's John King John Candy [laughter] through I mean is that cool or what he's a man of John Candy in the middle of the game he says this\nI was talking to this guy the other day about the forty niners so the only Jamie ever knew the good cover thirty five point spread was Joe Montana\nWell I'll tell you what ah I I feel lucky to have lived through a time to get to watch a guy like that plane [noise] because I I just I don't know anybody to play the game today that plays a game the way he did I don't I don't know if I had no at the time\nWhat was going to happen maybe it'll make it less fun because I hated the cowboys in my family loves the cowboys and I can remember sitting in our living room and I can remember him rolling right and my mother is screaming for them to second\nIn off the back of his heels he throws it too high and Dwight Clark jumps up and makes that catch and I remember it made it twenty seven all and I remember and then they're going to kick their point in my mom says sort of\nA a rhetorically he's going to make the extra point isn't it yes
