W Willie\nNashville heart radio\nLand saw expected tomorrow ... Fox News hurricane Michael dangerous category three storm it's now two hundred and fifty five miles south of Panama City Florida\nYour last day to register in person was today but you can register online\nFor one more week until the sixteenth in New York you can register up to twenty five days before the election which is October twelve\nUm but it must be ... you can also register by mail but it must be received\nBy October seventeenth in Alabama the rule is Fifteen days before the vote and so you can register up till October twenty second that is also the case in California\nAnd through our Oregon affiliate uh by the way Oregon and Louisiana or a through October sixteenth so one more week\nAnd for our listeners to K. E. X. eleven Ninety out of Portland, Oregon who live in Washington state your last day to register was yesterday your rule is twenty two days\nBefore the election but you can vote in person until October twenty night I'm not actually sure how that works\nUm I was going through and looking at the various dates of registration and I saw that\nSold for our state of Washington residence\nClear to me if you are not yet registered or your registration may have lapsed checked that on line there will be resources to each of you depending on your state's I'm asked to win exactly you can vote spent some time on that don't just ask\nSomebody I often get asked\nQuestions in passing on the last day to register\nAnd there are often um some technicalities that go into that we will begin early voting for what I typically refer to as election day and I encourage you to early vote it's always easier there are typically more places for you to vote early\nThere is a shorter line than on election day and then if you get posted out of town or out of out of the country or you're sick or relative uh is is sick or it's raining terribly or for whatever reason then you don't miss the opportunity to vote so I'll give you early voting days as we get a little\nBit closer of because I Would really like to see Republicans hold the house the Senate when some governor's races and we are\nSaying if you don't want to entertain Michael very show you see all\nOf hurricane Michael [noise]\nVoter registration was extended in Florida in as residents there have been taking preparations for what could be we hope is not but of course could be being described as monstrous and deadly\nAnd uh I guess that will occur later tonight let's check in with some polls and then I Want to get to the issue of civility the ratings for um the state of Texas\nWhere Beto O'Rourke has been fed a bunch of cash they've raised twenty three million dollars from Hollywood in New York\nFor a progressive Democrat named Beto O'Rourke bend the idea was to sell this guy\nAs a Kennedy like who kid that was friends with your son at college\nHe played in the punk band he's\nTell how many abortions she had she wanted everybody to have abortions and she stood up uh she was a state senator she stood up during a Senate hearing in her paint shoes and filibustered for a very long time she may have had an abortion on the floor of a sudden it I don't know there were lots of abortions and lots of abortion talking women\nWere very excited this was a girl power moment of course she was defeated by twenty five percentage points but that's okay and then along comes beta well it would have been great if ... running against Senator Ted Cruz would have had a Democrat running in the governor's race to help him out\nAnd who did they have but loop involved is a lesbian sanctuary city open borders sheriff from North Texas\nProblem is loop is very loopy she lost her gun in the middle of the campaign which sort of looks awkward first sheriff\nTo lose your guns or she's under investigation there should empire property taxes um she's had all sorts of other ethical problems she's not very good on the stump she scares the hell out of Whitey the open borders thing or that she talks about so openly is odd and\nShe's just a little out of touch with Texas value so the Democrats have dropped her\n[noise] so there's loopy out there she's on her own she's probably going to end up losing by thirty five percentage points to the very popular Republican Governor Greg Abbott\nAnd it's too close it's too bad the races not closer because then more Republicans would show up\nAnd that would also in order to the benefit of Ted Cruz but the national left hates Ted Cruz this is the guy that single handedly shut down in the United states government by filibustering over Obamacare\nThis is the guy that was brought in on the wave of the Tea Party this is the guy that talks about small government and does it all over the country and lenses support candidates all over the country to get Tea Party Republicans elected\nAnd that brings us to ... do\nWell here we are twenty three million dollars later\nMovie stars musicians Hillary Clinton Kamala Harris Chuck Schumer he decided last\nWeek they would not accept the\nEndorsement of rock Obama because it's starting to look hot areas and now they're six percentage points behind after all\nOf that yeah he's going to say some things you don't like\nMichael very\nWindy what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after his head as Sean who's blink camera alerted him a burglars trying to\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was fought in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nCameras or why are free set up and minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years ... technology can while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent a police to help convict the crooks\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes it right on to double laid back\n\nIn other states but Bob in Santa Fe is up go ahead sir\n... or ... or ... bullet\nCharm and the odds and kind of went in\nWith that that can always ... polls are not determinative but they do\nTend to show trends to entering the trend showed that he was closing the gap and then a series of things happened and across the country were hurting Democrats and that was consistent in Texas it gives it a bit more credibility why do you asked\nAbout um\nAlso what do you think it said it was\nHoly and remote part of down or is he just talking from a distance are you in the bottom of a well\nOh no oh yeah there you go All right so go ahead\nOh yeah oh I said the Democrats take over the house or ... or ... or the whole trial going to go to a halt and going to reverse the economy going to kind of stay on what it is [noise]\nWell [noise] that's a complicated question I think that\nThe single most important aspect of the Trump presidency will say return in investor confidence and I returned to consumer confidence\nThe problem is with the quantitative easing that during the Obama years and this actually goes back to the ... just before the Obama president that the Obama inauguration\nThe fed pumps so much money into the economy and there was a period of time there that banks were basically getting free money\nIn order to to bolster the banks you were giving the banks free money to then go out and Lynn what can you imagine it [laughter] if if\nTold you to open a a burger joint and I came in and brought you all the supplies\nAnd and everything and covered your labor and all you had to do is sell the burgers I think most everybody could succeed in that market\nAnd so that's what happened the problem is once you open that spigot nobody wants to close it off so you had an artificially depressed interest rates\nThat Trump was Trump was ... I mean a Obama was getting the benefit of\nSo even though the Trump economy is better than the Obama economy was\nIt's an artificial comparison because what's happening now is you're watching these are the ... these um um interest rates start to creep back up\nAnd first of all you don't want that to happen before the election and that starts to scare people the cost of borrowing money which means the cost of research and development the cost of opening new locations the cost of investing in capital those sorts of things\nIncrease which slows that economic activity now for some reason\nAmericans have not been as willing to reward Trump for the economy that he ushered in as they should be\nI think that's probably partly due to this very divisive media strategy I think it's it's partly due to a very aggressive ah anti Trump movement and so he's not getting the bump that I think you you probably should have\nExpected him to get I mean look we're seeing historic numbers\nUnemployment claims down first time unemployment claims down which means layoffs or reduce the number of people are seeking work that can't find it are are down expansion in in the job force the stock market hitting historic highs I think the stock market has now hit a hundred\nHighs record highs during his presidency\nNow think about that that's like hitting a a a four hundred foot homerun or five hundred foot home run\nIt's not just that you hit a home run the next day in order to out do that you got to hit five oh five and then five ten and then five Fifteen and this economy has done that\nSo people have had this overnight increase in in wealth and that is due to a stock market that's up that I think reflects a lot of aspects\nNot solely or exclusively but mostly black university trying to encourage them to vote and he said quote don't let these old white people decide our lives for us\n\nHe said don't let these old white people decide our lives for us\nTed Cruz's forty seven ... forty six they're basically the same age\nBeto O'Rourke really Robert Francis O'Rourke which was how he was known when he left Texas and wasn't running for office and he was at Columbia University\nWhen he wrote that review referring to women bother anatomical parts for which he had to apologize last week so Robert Francis O'Rourke who is white is the candidate Kendrick Sampson wants them to vote for\nWhereas Ted Cruz is half Hispanic\nAnd basically the same age but he\nDoes mean what he says doesn't he don't let these old white people\nDecide our lives for us [noise] how long do you stoke this fire until it rips the fabric that unites us there is a a\nVery effective journalist who's been covering what's going on in Portland\nWhere mayor Ted Wheeler has basically handed over the reins of authority in the downtown streets of Portland to antifa\nAnd he has been publishing video of these antifa mobs who've taken over the downtown streets\nThey've closed off some streets they're redirecting people when you pull up there screaming at people their MS thing people this threatening people they're getting in front of cars they're banging on cars you why does this you Whitey that and it's white\nKids doing this oh they have some some blacks and their group but it's mostly white punk antifa are idiots doing this here's a little audio\nBut I Want to encourage you to go to Michael berry dot com and see this for yourself you can't believe this is happening in the United states but it is and it's happening in downtown Portland where the mayor Ted Wheeler continues to ... to a post tweets about joining with other mayors over renewable forests\nAnd energy and third world countries and recycling\nWhile his city has been taken over\nLittle white middle\nSo these guys have taken over control of the streets like this is like the the the rioting that occurs\nThe University of Missouri when after the Michael Brown case when control Ferguson, Missouri when when when towns are taken over\nThe business owners board up and flee well that's what this antifa has done it's the Occupy movement to point out that's that's that this is the group we're talking about the same types of groups and they're carrying sticks and clubs\nAnd they're standing at the intersections and ask cars unsuspecting drivers drive up they roll their windows down like what do I do you've you've blocked the street would and they tell them where to go you get out\nHere you go over there but that's but you know the ways or the the Google Map just telling me to go up there I\nI have a you know a doctor's appointment to block so people don't like change they're scared and as they do this these people begin to threaten them and the mayor Ted Wheeler won't do anything about it\nLittle white little\n\nWhitey are allergic to go\nRight next to this trafficking\nYour your your\nAnd the crowd begins to grow and you know those people with quite some zeal are joining this this crowd and you can't you don't have A Panoramic view how long to one of them step from the crowd and knocks you out what if one of the pushes you\nFrom behind would have another one pushes you would have one of them slaps you across the face pulls at your hair grabs for your wallet\nWhat if one of 'em grabs your keys and now you're stranded how is this supposed to end up or they

just as meat\nOr more importantly how will this be interpreted by Maxine Waters supporters how exactly will they view this\nHow long\nBefore they approach a woman who happens to be an elected official or a bureaucrat\nOr has a Trump sticker\nOr wearing a Trump cap\nWe saw water burger here where the guy in his thirties went over to some Fifteen year olds\nWhen I'm was wearing a cap that said make America great again\nHe took their drink through\nTheir face he bullied those kids taunted those kids he intimidated those kids and when he was later caught he said that he viewed the wearing of that cap like hurling racial epithets\nYou see you first declare your enemy to be a Savage monster and then you can do whatever you want to them\nThe standard bearer for the Democrats their presidential candidate in the last election says they can no longer\nBe civil with you people were not the typical with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you found for what you\nSee you all want to destroy everything she stands for so she can't be civil with you here's brick here's Brooke Baldwin from CNN when\nIt is described as a mob that ah that that accosted or took over a Ted Cruz and and his wife ...\nDinner recently listen to how offended she is don't use that word\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word ... totally a mob it is without\nA doubt that there's no way that we are now it's a little put up with a lot is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August ... is not what we saw chasing we've right what about\nThe people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls what do you call that civil protest or is that a mob I think it's easily a mob\nYeah and if there weren't any party as we call it a ... come on let's be Syria [noise]\nLiving now let me let me let me move past the N. word\nWonder what you'd call it when Steve ... was shot on\nThe softball field [noise] we're not the civil with political party that wants to destroy which we stand for a post\nOn the Michael berry CEO\nPortland Europe's go ahead [noise]\nHey Michael how are you doing this guy great joy it hey heard on lunch today on the news there was a report this weekend where these protests them or let an elderly man his car got around it by the uh the dogs\nWere beat this car ah they did like three thousand dollars worth of damage to your car and the pleased with not respond\nYet I don't see legally oh I've seen the video have you seen it\nBut yeah I was on the video but I heard what I heard the official police response today\nOn the radio what they say just spoke spokesman said a ... that we need to understand and I pinch in situations like this or if the\nWhen he jumps out of the car and looks to make sure there's not somebody under the carriage car so that he can\nDrive away and get away from this they catch up to him and that's\nWhen they started on him he manages to get back\nIn his car and get it closed before they can get to him they start beating on the car he speeds away they're screaming get his licence plate well they've now ducks him you know what ... that's where you get his information and you make that very public\nThe point of docs thing is not simply learning someone's name and address\nAnd and you know where they can be found are are are there legal particulars the point of docs thing is bringing the fear upon someone that something bad is going to happen to them\nBy a random anonymous person by exposing their information the idea is to put them in a state of fear can you imagine this old man I'm sure he's left his residence I'm sure if he has adult children or or somewhere he can go I'm sure he's he's left town\nAnd what's he does what's this old man done she was driving downtown probably to a medical appointments maybe the bowels bookstore maybe they get a cup of coffee or eat some Thai food Portland has a couple of good Thai restaurants downtown that I really like\n[noise] maybe to go down to the waterfront he's done nothing wrong except\nAnd and we don't even know what his voting history is we don't even know that he's an awful conservative odds\nAre that he's a liberal Democrat but that's the odds he is in Portland he's in Douma counties in downtown\nOdds are he's a TiVo wearing a old Eugene Oregon knew this colony hippie liberal mean odds are\nBut just remember\nWe have to assume that old white people are out to destroy our way of life these savages and we can't be civil to them anymore\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse hand or the ... when civility started down but until then the only thing that the Republican whom to recognize and respect its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process as they\nThey laughed at mass forward they laughed at her and she will not be laughed at do you understand this she will not\nThe violence will not stop it will not stop\nGoing to go on and not in the face up to your customers\nThey will not be silent I'm not going to be you know these people have had enough and they're bringing the muscles\nIn

that has been the bone but Mr Cosco has been denied bail which would suggest that there is more to this story\nThat he is a flight risk and that he is\nPerhaps a more shady character than we might have initially believed now he has worked for Dianne Feinstein\nAnd she did have a Chinese spy on her payroll driving her around for Twenty years or maybe it's his association with Sheila Jackson Lee or maybe it's because he's a fellow as they've called his legal status paid for by an outside organization as yet undetermined\nWith who knows what ties may be the Russian government who knows\nMaybe that accounts for why Sheila Jackson Lee\nWas very oddly at a Senate hearing handing a thick envelope maybe package to Michael Brown which the lawyer for Mr ... from is Ford while they were testifying
