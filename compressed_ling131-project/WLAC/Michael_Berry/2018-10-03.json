{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "It just jumped or exit team can help you with that and getting rid of those and then the cars how much do you owe on your cars\n[noise] um we have a track right now that's forty five out of an ... mile and your household income as what I'm way I had to grow about one thirty year you know\nYou get rid of both them and just get you to be years from now while you get this mess cleaned up it's not a forever car\nIt it's just a short period of time but if you can ... the huge amount of money you got going out the door on cars and the huge amount of last year taking every day and appreciation of how fast are going down in value is just destroying you guys so I I Would just moved down to like to five thousand dollar cars and [laughter] you\nKnow even if you got a little bit on those and you've got a little bit on where you were upside down finance it over to a credit union or something to cover their mouth that you're in the hole is still a lot less debt than you've got now and you stop the bleeding\n[noise] yeah and so I guess I'm not exactly sure how to go about doing that you have a little\nWhile here and we walk you through it okay let's take the thirty two thousand dollar car that's the dead on the car correct\nYeah unless pretend that when you look that car up on the Kelley Blue book that you can private cell that car for um like twenty eight thousand\nWhich will be like four thousand in the whole I now where do we get to four thousand well you obviously don't have any money you're broke right so you're going to either borrow that from your local credit union or your bank\nAnd you'll be four thousand dollars in debt instead of twenty eight there should have thirty two thousand dollars in debt\nSo that's huge progress right there okay and the and then a let's say that I come up to buy the car I hand you a check for twenty eight thousand you put the four thousand you borrowed from the credit union with it and pay the car off that get you the title to give to me the buyer\nMy okay and that's how you do it now who are your lungs with on the cars\n[noise] um one is a credit union and want to throw out\nOkay the allied deal will ... will work just like I talked about just now the credit union you may be able to sit down with them\nAnd convince them by sitting in person in the manager's office only so it's not a telephone conversation but you may try to say hey look this is how far we are upside down on this car which means that you have a partially secured loan\nYou have alone is secured by this much the value of the car the rest of this one was an an secured loan\nRight you\nUnderstand what I'm saying yeah OK then the uh\nAnd so Mr manager all we're asking you to do is to admit that it's an secured by giving us an inch beard loan for the amount that you're there were in the whole I Want to sell the car and get out of this debt okay\nThen you got a five thousand dollar loan and credit union whenever the differences are you know at the credit union instead of a forty five thousand dollars or whatever the word whatever the numbers work out to be but I Would dump both of these cars get into some very very cheap cars for a period of time while you're clean this mess up and it's gonna\nYou a couple of years clean this mess up oh yeah but five years from now you'll be driving anything you want to drive you pay cash for it [noise] and it's not like health and well it's not open I mean you you can do it mathematically if you just take the steps and sacrifice to get there but you've got to amputate I you know these cars I mean you've got thousand dollars\nA month car payments are more probably twelve hundred\nAnd um you know it's just it's choking you to death here to feel so much more free when you get rid of those stupid vehicles\nAnd then later on and get your whatever you want your drive like no one else will lead or you can drive like no one else you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else Betty Lewis with us in San Antonio I Betty Lou how are you\nCan you hear me now yes ma'am how can I help okay cool\nI Am I was telling your comrade that I thought like on the poster child at sixty too far away that financial decisions and not by a semi retirement and the reason I'm calling because I I Am working full time on sixty two I\nWant to find out how to leverage my situation my income by saving fat or I have found that to ensure at least a reasonably comfortable retire at which I plan on going about eight years\nShould iron and what do you make up too much do you make I make a sixty six thousand a year good ... how much do you have\nI have twenty thousand standing that and I am twenty eight hundred do online vehicle which our pay off by Tobar\nMhm okay so twenty two twenty three thousand dollars in debt making sixty six that's good All right and how much money do you have saved not counting retirement\nOkay so I had the government's version of a four O. one K. which is called ... and I'm sure you're familiar with it and I have about eleven thousand and and I was\nYou have any money other than that saved\nI have a thousand dollar fine\nOkay good All right cool while we stop adding to the tea SP temporarily\nYes I I I well I took it down to one percent\nStop temporarily and could concentrate on the twenty three thousand dollars worth of that with the airlines and you've got squeeze every dollar out because when you don't have any payments then you have control of your most powerful wealth building too\nWhich is your income right now it's all going on student loans carpet and so we get rid of the car payment you're a student loan payment that we build an emergency fund raising the thousand dollar up to a three to six months of expenses emergency fund baby step three and then maybe step for is saving Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nAnd um you know where will that leave you is the next question so we'd like sixty six thousand dollars let's just pretend for a second\nAnd Fifteen Percent of that is Ninety nine hundred and ... says eight hundred bucks a month give or take nine hundred bucks a month something like that going into retirement\nUm and we start with eleven thousand rather live in a hundred and putting this on the calculators mumbling All right when the calculator and we're going to do this for say I'm\nI'll just put ten years and there for the phone I was just to see what it does\nShe would kind of money we end up with here that would be about a quarter million dollars\nThat you would have a retirement and you would be Seventy two\nAt that point um and that's not counting any kind of match from the government a lot of most of the CSP just don't have a match and that's not counting any raises you get during the next ten years while you're working but if your debt free and buy their own your house would be paid off too by the way\nUm and so if your debt free one hundred percent and you have two to three hundred thousand dollar sitting there\nYou're going to make it I'd like to have you have a lot more but it's not as a whole lot tougher piece from social insecurity is your only\nWay to retire um and you certainly don't have to buy the cookbook Seventy two ways to prepare a bow and love it you'll be able to eat so you put the income for three hundred grand along with um\nThe income from Social Security in your early seventies and everything is paid for 'em I think you'll be okay uh we're we're past panic mode anyway because we now have a plan I'm going to send you a copy of Chris Hogan book retire inspired which will help you walk through those steps\nThat I just gave you not
