want to call the agent you can call them I don't care but you know their job is to save the say you'll lose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself\nAnd so there's no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve any ...\nI wasn't going to have it Irish just going to be underground can't no matter what you know but I didn't know there are certain steps now that if I didn't take I Would leave out on getting them the most out of the cash value whatever's there\nNo there's no difference at all all you do as you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't good customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know ask them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value what's the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow Walker ignore your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancel on a credit card you got to argue with them to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent as all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to sign a piece of paper forget them to do that that's not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I think um I went up and down probably seven months ago on ... really challenging time because we have found that in college I think that we need to pay for and that's how I have Harry Carey expenses ticket candidate extent that they\nCan hide it and not ...\nI'm going to try to figure out in the\nHands before they can be a cool fair ... pounds on or taking out a scare that while I'm afraid I just want to make sure that we're doing the right things change I don't know when I'm trying to be coming back to work and it was nearly straight out of this data on cars and that just by\nYou know what I'm Sorry you did the ... century you lost your job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\nIf you're\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got to do so what a master's you're in the middle of a storm we get a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise]\nComing up we're totally with I have to pay twenty history by coming out here and I have to pay about it as\nOkay and do you have eight thousand okay\nWell I mean it might cause you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\n\nTo have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout five\nAnd what does your are you married\nYes and what does your husband might be okay and what did you used to do 'em in software support and how long have you been laid off on down Saturday Night while not been able to land somewhere worth yeah definitely I ...\nI I'm going around something in that period of time in that field\nThat next to about ... working on it\nBecause I I Know in other words the good news is you're in a an active technology type position\nThat ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely you're not if you're in an active market metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester or time get a job pays eight thousand\nOne of the two but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life out of your husband's income and that's what you push through\nBut I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but\nNo I'm not borrowing the money I don't teach people to borrow money at them borrow money should emergencies don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid and greed and fear are a good way to lose your butt with money for sure\nSo don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force emperor Christie's where there is in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you all\nKinds of games that are taking my call sure why my head and and I are brand new ... in August can kind of you know are they in California and in our new we I had a\nJob in coming here as a para educator and kind of a school district has been good not and so our goal at the cash and we had\nThat and and I mean technocrat banker that got engaged anyway anyway ... along with ... eternity we now have to pay well we align against it about four years ago and\nHad eight thousand dollars you're meaning like\nRetiring and giving him the Afghan may campaigning I have to take the dollar is going to hear cash paying off a ... dollar he retired from there\nWell he ... a company all day long hearing uh twenty eight year if if the Y. and could lift him during hiring\nNow that doesn't matter on this you know four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do own fault it's Irish regulations\nHad to come back on it saying that that ... that he can continue to maintain it\nAnd I just got it right I I don't I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer and found a regulation that aligns with the with what the companies are saying that's fine but I don't think that's so\nMy I don't have any of that happening I think it's called we call it that far when Kay pick on you know you need to\nAnd they call it ... professional who got the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and you are taxed and penalize\nAnd that's my understanding of the rail okay so\nWhat I read that under the impression was originally when we laugh we weren't going to be able to pay it back that's what we thought drawn based on what they told us that we were going to take that penalty and the taxes on it wow and back when we got\nFeature country music I saw Willie Nelson was endorsed or works hand to sit\nBack and better overcoming a package better\nState just because you're a good musician and a good poet doesn't mean I Want you running

but he thought he was binding was the lead singer of you'd be forty on the\nBoat you know when the boy did you move\n[noise] but you need to dumb\n\nAll the left that lost their ever love in mind\nWhat\nThey've lost their ever loving mind because Brett Kavanaugh was going to be confirmed Morrow Susan Collins\nGave a speech today this afternoon explaining\nWhy she will be voting for Brett Kavanaugh and the left who told us to respect women and believe women oh my goodness\nThey have said the nastiest things about her you see the left doesn't like women they only like the women who do what they're told if women are independent and cast their own votes as they see fit it\nSort of like it or Hillary Clinton after she lost the election saying nasty things about the women who didn't vote for her\nDemocrats are going back to my husband even before but just in recent times going back to bill and and and uh\nOur candidates and then President Obama had been losing the white vote including white women uh we do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married white women\nUm and part of that is a an identification with the Republican Party a and a I'm a director of ongoing pressure a to\nA vote the way that your husband your boss uh your son whoever uh believes you should and what happened in my election is I was on the way to winning I'm white women\nUntil [noise] former director of the FBI Jim Comey dropped that are very ill advised letter on October the twenty eighth in my numbers just went down because all and I heard a lot of anecdotal evidence about those people have written about it\nAll of a sudden you know white women who were going to vote for me and frankly standing up to the men in their lives and the men in their workplaces\nAre we're being told she's going to jail you know you don't want to vote for her you know it can be terrible you can't vote for that\nSo it just it stopped by momentum and it decreased my vote a enough because I was I was\nI had I was winning and I thought I had bought my way back in the ten days from that letter until on the election I fell a little bit short and so I think that it it was part of the historical trend that I was mocking and then it collapsed on me\n[laughter] you don't like beer Brett Kavanaugh to what he said that I like beer I still like bear I like so we're going to pop a top we're going to drink a beer\nTo Brett Kavanaugh soon to be Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh left tried it just like a stupid criminals episode the lab tried everything that good and the law

vicious ugly woman nobody likes you and that's why you lose\nThat's why you're left with ugly ugly angry women as your spokesman that Dianne Feinstein the Sheila Jackson Lee that what you're left with and you lose\nWill get used to that saying altogether mountains\nJust didn't\nWe here at my ... year on average man\nWoman should be able to momma goal\n\nOr a declared that the office party for this person was going to happen to be hosted by ...\nJob is going to be a keg party like they have never had before\nIn Georgia you know\nFolks aren't going to tell you the way around it is\nJust recommended a book demand that you will like this book it's almost like you wrote it because it's all about choosing to be happy choosing not to let negative people get you down\nWhat's it called the monkey off my bad my management consultant recommended to people I've been our mentors out there sitting in the name of that book again um I don't have the book yet then I'm going to get it but we were talking I was saying you know it it took me a long time to understand your as happy as you want\nTo be your is unhappy as you want to be I come across people hey man how you doing\nMy ... not good at all why are you not\nGet this isn't true today but Astros last three games in a row Texans are good so you're\nAn end run around in\nYour own Michael Moore show go ahead I mean yeah and that's just a\n... and then the thing about the people that just can't be happy and man I just divorced on rather got divorced from the ones that started happening I was just like so relieved I'm married ... years stay at home mom\nOr we are salary the last year that we initially and everything with a freaking quarter of a million dollars and she thought she had problems with other people have way worse problems but er I guess you got to be unhappy about something I never been happier in my life to have that that stuff is gone\nYou know there are people who\nLet's take television music culture parenting all that out of it there are people who were drawn toward darkness\nThere are glass half empty people and and I think that's that's just their natural disposition they are drawn toward negativity\nAnd you have to explain it in economics terms to understand that those people are only happy they only gain utility from negativity and in fact you see this a lot on the left the left sees happiness and its manifestations\nAs Pollyanna they see it as unsophisticated they see being happy\nNot being sufficiently concerned about the ... of the world\nAnd they see being very sad more real bone and I'm I'm dark\nAs being\nIn tune with the problems of the world\nAnd that's why they never stopped funding problems it might be plastics draws it might be um a Boko Haram taking little girls\nIt might be a tax policies inequalities illegals need the ... they're going to find something to be unhappy about\nAnd sometimes they'll split their loyalty but they like to have one thing they have convinced themselves I mean if you watch\nThey have convinced themselves that Brett Kavanaugh sitting on the Supreme Court is going to be the end of the world\nAnd they have so worked themselves into a fervor it's sort of disappointing\nThat he's not going to be as awful as they've convinced them so it kind of be nice if he was just sort of Darth Vader figure and he wouldn't wear black robe you just come in and his black tape and all and he'd sit down\nYou know that it'd be it James Earl Jones do as do his voice and and when he when he would ask a question or make a statement you hear the heavy breathing new up your father and you do it from the bench that'd\nBe fantastic I mean it it's almost as if\nKavanaugh on the bench they're going to move past that and a year from now that things which they thought was going to be the end of the world won't be\nBut it's not that they're ever going to double back and go you know what [laughter] is this kind of silly I'm embarrassed to admit it but I I mean I really thought I thought everybody was going to die I felt when Kavanaugh\nOnce he became a Supreme Court I literally dot in you know you just drive along and they just be dead people on the side of the road I I guess I got caught up in at all I guess I got got caught up in how awful it was going to be listen we lived through eight years of Iraq Obama\nYou're gonna survive this somehow you're going to survive in fact\nBy your own reckoning the worst thing that's possibly ever going to happen old white liberal women\nWho are beyond the age of conception and the way the worst thing is going to happen is that you're going to have sex with some random stranger at a bar and you're going to have to carry that baby to term\nAnd honesty that wouldn't be such a bad thing I understanding your world it would I mean if you're Wendy Davis and you just love is Thursday I Need to have an abortion again but but other than that it's it's not as bad as as you think it's gonna be and and you know what's interesting\nWhat's interesting is the old white liberal women\nAre so obsessed with sex and reproduction and killing their babies but nobody wants to have sex with them anyway\nAnd even if anybody did want to have sex with them they have so confused and disoriented and perverted sex to take any joy out of the process\nI Am and I was going to happen tomorrow\nAll the right people are going to be crying as ... they're going to be trained to\nKnow why they're saying\nNow like in their minds the world's going to come to an end\nThey every relative they know it was about to die in\nTheir house is about to burn down\nTheir car is going to explode\nEveryone's going to be murdered being most\nNone of that is going to happen but in their mind they're going to be that level\nOf upset because they\nTheir whole life is wrapped up into the meeting this man and a destroying other careers in\nThere and everything they did they use\nAll the phrase is sexual harassment grave drinking\nThey use everything they have a great thing they had me\nAnd guess what the the more\nAnd they lost because in life they're losers never forget that never forget they're losers\nYears into Brock Obama with their lives any better no because they're hysterical unhappy people and they're driven by old white liberal\nHillary Clinton\nWe didn't get elected but Hillary Clinton is what role and the Democrat\nDianne Feinstein that run the Democratic\nMake no mistake about\nThey sell the ... you can have a seat in the table but you can't run in and then\nThey tell the Hispanic and you know\nBut at the end of it all\nCrusty ride um\nWhite women to run it all\nHello Joe you're on my library\nWhat Europe OK I'm active in topic related to ... uh it would go real fast one word answer yes or no doubt\nI think the parameters are they need to change a bit to extend a great lipstick lesbian oh just regular brother bill why I think they'd be nervous I don't understand

lot of people have issues with gay men if your issue is is with gay man because you don't want your kids to grow up and be gay men\nThen lesbian women or no probably\nLike lesbian women you can't
