like forty one thousand we put eleven thousand down with a trade in and everything I'm about thirty five thousand on it together we have about twenty thousand in saving a she\nEssentially what I got from her that she kind of want to skip the baby step three that she doesn't have any other day that there are only ... the foreigner in the house mhm um she kind of life gets to babysit three to\nCompare to get out and so that would put her pain you know the normal mortgage and\nHe um gets that all my bills that we have and fading everything out until she gets out of the military she's still she teaches dance on the side as well so she's got additional income what's your question um I wanted to know if we should tackle this foreigner together mhm\nAnd get this thirty five thousand out of the way mhm or if you think that we\nJust keep going about it the way that we're going to let her continued to save and then meet tackled a foreigner and eventually when she\nI think you're running in the natural tension that occurs when you're trying to\nAct like you're married but you're not you 'cause you're vacillating back and forth between acting like a married couple are acting like room mates\nAnd your and your ... so it's my bills her ... her bills but we did this and we did that and yeah under in a legal sense from ... from the law perspective there's not a week\nYeah you have a roommate from ... from the perspective of the law you see what I'm saying and so if if she decides to walk out the door whoever's names are on these things or who's going to be holding the bag\nWhoever's yeah name or any savings accounts which can be there so you're in relation Lee you're struggling\nBack and forth and vacillating so um you guys can do what you want to do obviously you're grown ups and you've done very well you're making a hundred and twenty year congratulations [noise] um you called and asked me so I Will tell you what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes okay yeah\nI Would get married tomorrow\nAnd then there would be no you're for one runner your savings account you're this it would only be weak and then I Would work the baby steps exactly as prescribed\nIt's what I Would do I think you're making really good money I think you pay the stupid for runner off or get rid of it before she gets out and I want her to one another I Want her to line up her career\nOr for what she's going to do as she comes out of the military but you ... the thing is you you just can't vacillate between you know ... looking in the refrigerator and going well that's my mustard how 'bout that mustard\nUm you know back in ... or no that's our mustard because we're we're doing this together oh why can't decide and there's there's it it just polls at people part is um there's all kind of\nStatistical research that shows you're going to have substandard results in your finances as well as other areas of your life until you put marriage in the equation\nAnd so you do what you want to do I'm I'm just an old guy advising you I've got several reasons for that advice but um that's what I Would tell you ...\nIf you were in my little brother that's what I Would tell you to do I'd say get married and stop trying to play both sides of this coin just do it and you know you've been together forever anyway you do in life together it's a technicality really but then you have to say from that point forward we\nWe have a foreigner we have a house we have a savings account we have a plan we are going to submit ourselves\nTo the baby steps we are going to stick with this we are going to go that route and and you become French at that point we week right [laughter] and so that that's what I Would do it cleans up everything and then walk ride down it and if you want to say well\nYou know we're facing an emergency with the loss of her income and so we're not going to work the baby steps right now we're just going to pile of cash and get ready for a baby step that's not really skipping the baby step three that's just saying we're not gonna do anything right now in Palo money if you want to make that decision you can 'cause you're panicked about the loss of her income\nI don't think I'm panicked about the loss of her income though um\nBecause a I think she's going to have another income lined up she's got from now the June to figure that out and be I don't know what percentage of your income she of our income once were married that she represents so that that's the other thing you've got to look at the variable will is with us in California Hi Will welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA day driving me sure what's up so I\nI've got a four home that I own a three hour rentals at this point uh was I was my primary residence\nTwo of those trials are paid off and the third I owe about one Seventy on I guess my question is\nI have the cash to pay that a rental property off completely I'm Wondering if I should versus what the ultimate goal is to get more investment properties so I was wondering what your thoughts are on that\nIs the ultimate goal to have a bunch of investment properties and a bunch of debt on them or a bunch of investment properties that are played for\nA pay for of course okay then let's start with that okay\nThat's what I did um the second time the first time I had him on that and I lost everything but the second time I don't borrow money and more and so I I you know I paid off all my properties and I use the increase cash flow that was resulting\nTo buy the next property and by the next one and of course every time you buy another one you got that much more cash flow that's debt free cash does I mean these things cash brought like crazy when you know what I mean that right\n[noise] right it changes the only thing how much do you do your residence or my primary is about to forty okay the rental the rental is one Seventy and you have how much cash about two twenty okay I'm a ... first\nOff the primary first yep yep\nAnd either way ... either way you're increasing ... well the reason is simply this your your heart is part of this equation it's not simply a math equation\nUh and when you're homeless paid off for you think differently you can't keep yourself from doing it you will make different decisions um it ... it calms you down\nUm you know you just chill and not in a way where you lose your ambition or something like that but um you relax or because you're walking around the back yard when their shoes on and you're at it\nThat's real different under your feet the bar or really is labor the lender of experience that and I've had many many many people are transferred over the years that I've talked to millions of people in and of course that frees up that two thousand or whatever dollars a month what's your household income\nOr about one forty five good you've been doing great how old are you a forty four\nYou're doing well you're doing very very well so either way without\nWithout these psychological I guess it's kind of what your cars that are there that right on the money on it owed used to be my primary residence or probably will be some part so if you take the emotional equation out of it doesn't matter which one you pay off her she was the other\nThe emotional equations part of the equation\n[noise] so yes it ladders it's personal finances personal it's not just for that when you try to do your wealth building process\nAnd don't involve behavior and don't involve relationships and don't involve emotions and don't involve spirit and your spiritual off and you're you're\nYou're you've got a substandard plan this is your daughter away all my family\nAnd you're gonna miss it and you do whatever you want that will guide the progress but if I were you that's what I Would do that was his hours a day for him to show in the Bush will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial ... daily with the press a peace prize\nJames child producer of the day ... show I'm excited to it now we're now carry on the hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to debut dot com bust show\nRecord turnout and it has continued up pace\nWe're seeing it in small towns were ... seeing it in some of the smaller of the counties I'm hearing about it across the country people are energized devote the Democrats have poured a lot of money into this election\nAnd we can't really know the polls can only tell you so much [noise]\nFolks who show up and vote who are registered to a party or presumed to be voting for that party in places where there is registration by party and that helps because everybody wants to predict the result before it's in but two thousand sixteen\nEfficient teachers anything it is that we don't know until\nThe votes coming [noise] story has been making the rounds late yesterday and then today\nThat the five ... terrorists [noise] for whom sergeant Bowe Bergdahl were traded the insurgents\nFrom get mon they'd been captured from the battlefield where they had been fighting as terrorists against us and our allies\nThey were treated by President Obama for ... Bowe Bergdahl and at the time\nWe were told Bowe Bergdahl was a great guy I mean he was a hero remember [noise] in fact that the town where he was from I Can't remember it was Oregon Idaho was going to have a hero's welcome waiting for him you\nRemember that Susan Rice at the time had this to say finally on this point I\nSaw a lot of questions about how he originally was half and whether or not he has a deserted has left his post is that going to be investigated HIV is found that he did indeed I leave his post will he be disciplined or as only paying the price [noise]\nCertainly\nAnybody who's been held and those conditions in captivity for five years is paying an extraordinary price for that that is really not the point the point is that he's back he's going to be safely free and I did with his family and I said when honoring distinction\n[noise] she also in June of fourteen one of many law she told said\nThis is a this is a very special situation a sergeant Bergdahl wasn't simply a hostage he was an American prisoner of war captured on the battlefield we have a sacred obligation that we have upheld since the founding of our republic to do our utmost to bring back our men and women who are taken in battle\nAnd we did that in this instance if for some reason we took a position on the twenty first century when some of our adversaries may not be traditional state actors and then we would not do our utmost to to bring our prisoners of war home\nAnd that would break faith with the American people and with the men and women who serve in uniform so regardless of who may be holding an American prisoner of war we must do our best to bring him or her back\n[noise] he abandoned his platoon and men were killed trying to retrieve him that turned out to be a fact President Obama was traveling in Poland at the time and said this\nRegardless of the circumstances whatever those circumstances may turn out to be\nWe still get an American soldier back 'cause he's always got paid for it\nAnd they gave up five five terrorists for him at the time while in Poland President Obama said this\nRelease of the Taliban who are being held in Guantanamo [noise] was conditions on the cars keeping our eyes on them and creating a structure in which we can monitor their activities we will be keeping our eyes on them is\nThe possibility of a some of them trying to return to [noise] activities that are\nDetrimental up absolutely that's been true of\nAll the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo those they certainly has the ex wife [noise]\nI wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was ... ... American national security and the news\nBreaking now that those five men have left cutter and our back on the battlefield working against us and you wonder why President Trump wins elections\n... there's anybody to remember that name\nThis is the way we think so we get a trader named Bergdahl dirty rotten\nTrader [noise] by\nWhen he deserted six young beautiful people were killed trying to find right [noise] and you don't even hear about 'em anymore somebody said the other day well he had some psychological problems well you know you know the old days being bombed\n[noise] when we were strong\nSo we get Bergdahl a traitor and they get five of the people that they most wanted anywhere in the world five killers that are right now back on the battlefield doing a job [noise]\nThe kind of deals we make\nThat kind of deals we make right am I right\nPresident Trump was right\n[noise] been right on some other things [noise] some interesting news updates [noise] good economic news campaign updates more\nComing up on how this\nIs from Michael ... so\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall a civilian well let me get storey\nGiven attorney general election is Amr ... members from\nHarvey practical tonight I saw her promoting for your sample ballot and bring it with a guy who can vote on all wrong\nOn my own in

officially will not up dealt with for years left on his deal the Yankees resigned outfielder bread Gardner to a one year contract the NFL's on Fox TV tomorrow night raiders at forty niners feeds the\n\nThe thing is taking control of the narrative\nVery cleverly we're not talking about\nThe ... job down in Florida mailing packages any longer are we talking about birthright citizenship\n[noise] the president has made that the issue before I get further along\nOn that\nLet's go back to where the Democrats were just a few years ago the Democrats have moved away from a position that I think is at the core of America's set of values this is where the Democrat Party moved away from\nTheir base\nAnd they've struggled since then it's why they lost the house the Senate the White House the majority of governorships state legislatures here is Dianne Feinstein of all people in Nineteen Ninety four\nWe can enforce our borders I think we should enforce our borders to have a situation where ... percent of the babies born on Medicaid in California today are born of illegal immigrants creates a very real problem for the state which is ...\nThere was a time when the Democratic party understood that working class Americans were the folks hit hardest by legal immigration\nWhere poor minorities in this country are hit hardest by an influx in the best case of cheap labor working outside the laws and procedures we have for our employment process\nIf an employer hires an illegal alien who comes into this country outside our employment loss there is a cost savings to them which gives them a competitive advantage over the businesses to their right to their left\nThat competitive advantage by reducing the labor costs means that their next door neighbors have to increase the cost of their product without necessarily increasing the quality\nAmerican consumers are very cost sensitive there's an elastic demand based on price\nSo if one company can only produce a product for five dollars to the marketplace due to labor costs but the company beside them can put it on the market for four dollars because they don't have to pay their employees and comply with all these labor laws that they refused to by breaking the law\nThe consumer sees a four dollar product in a five dollar ... and it doesn't take long to the consumer says\nAs long as there's no quality differentiate or oh by the four dollar doesn't take long until the five dollar products sits and languishing on the shelf and that business goes out of business and that hurts the American worker\nWho is saddled with all of our labor protections because some people are choosing to cheat the system and hire illegal aliens Colin Powell even admitted that he did it\nThere were three straight attorney general candidates under Clinton who had to withdraw 'cause they had hired illegal alien nannies the Democrat Party at one time understood that illegal immigration hurt the poor and working class in this country the most\nBut there came a point where they finally decided\nThat it's going to be our future and not the poor and working class will have to keep them by screaming races [noise] that's what the\nThe Michael very show\nMultiplying October twenty puffing on her phone from one of my camera phones on\nCorporate problem seventh and vote on ... hours animal ... from Austin who are ... up over time [noise]\nDuring early vote them over and over I prefer to think of all hanging from harmful\nDon't know\n... told ... CNN you guys\nYou wouldn't make it financially without Trump\nYou wouldn't make it John Stewart went deeper\nTake out the financial aspect of the fact that the news has to be interesting\nAnd\nTrump draws eyeballs you know Brian Stone or said something very dishonest in the middle of that conversation he said something very very dishonest let me see if I can get to know\nI Would say oh we might be up twenty we might be thirty percent we might be a forty percent if we go back down forty percent that's okay too\nThat is a lie let me explain I'm sure you know this and I don't mean to insult your intelligence but I Want to make sure you understand\nListeners will often say to me they'll write the people that don't like usually on the left they'll say oh well they they very rarely say to me but they'll go on social media sites\nAre Margot bearing the only reason he says all those things about illegal immigration or ... or this or that it's for ratings\nLet's unpack that for a moment if the reason I Do what I Do is because a lot of people will listen if I Do\nDoes that mean that it's popular let's just assume for a moment that I don't say anything actually mean I just pay under for more people to listen right well if that's the case couldn't anybody do that\nAnd more importantly don't we subscribe to the theory that that\nWhich a lot of people consume whether they pay for it or not because you don't pay to listen to the show\nBut you do listen and that does drive up the ratings if that's the case doesn't that mean it's a product people want that's like saying\nYou know tied they only make their detergent because people want to buy it and then you know water burger and eating out and McDonalds and Burger King that the only reason they're putting\nCheese and and sesame seed buns is because people like to eat it well well yeah that's kinda that's how that works I mean do you say of a company that goes out of business\nYeah yeah ... no there they were great they regret nobody bought they're proud of what they were great they were true to their mission vetted sell anything and then their investors lost their their high eighties but they were they were great\nPeople because they didn't give people what they wanted they gave people what they didn't want and therefore people chose not to purchase their product is dumb every body wants ratings every body wants ratings make no mistake about it\nBut let me explain for a moment and again I I don't mean to patronize if you understand this it's it seems pretty straightforward but it's important to understand why ratings are important to CNN ratings are more important than CNN than they are to me and let me explain why [noise]\nFirst stations like CNN or for music stage stations on the radio [noise]\nMost of the advertising which is where the money is made right you don't pay to consume the show you get it free but the trick is if we can get a bunch of you to listen\nThen companies will pay to have their names said all of you so that while you're in the middle of listening you'll hear their name right\nNo matter what the radio that's how it works so they pay the station so the station puts this product out to you for free and the station receives money to in addition to the content to throw in some references to car dealers or a electricians or whatever restaurants whatever that may be\nThe higher the ratings are more listeners the more listeners the more they'll pay\nBecause you pay more to get to talk to a hundred thousand people than to talk to a thousand people so sure every station every show wants to have the highest ratings higher the ratings are more of the money and it's purchased in terms of water called points and I don't want to go too far into the weeds here\nBut the more listeners viewers for TV stations you have the more you can sell your ad to tide or Chevrolet or Ford\nOr whatever food packaging company or anything else\nSo of course they share the same\nThirty second ad on CNN [noise] the same at the same created the whole deal that runs\nDuring the super bowl will sell for a hundred times more I don't know how much more it's probably a hundred times do you know why\nBecause there is a hundred times more people watching the super bowl and seeing and the more people that watch the more you can charge for the same exact thirty seconds you see a TV station only has so many hours in the day they can sell advertising on\nThey only have so many spots at some point you stretch that you can't go any further\nSo the more people that are viewing or in radio listening\nWell the reason I care less about it is I don't have to have ratings we do but I don't have to because I have qualitative I don't have quantitative you see stations that are talking to people that are Eighteen to thirty for what are you selling those people\nDiapers and Coca Cola maybe some beer\nThe people that are listening to our show have money you're older you're more financially secure hats\nWho the advertisers want\nIf you're trying to sell a roof to somebody or an eye surgery or most anything else you go where the money yes right why do you Rob banks that's random mommy years so I don't have to worry how many people are listening 'cause we have qualitative\nBut enough of that John Stewart talking about the president and what exactly he does the gets their goat and this is from a guy who's not his fan stay tuned we'll talk about\nTo do things because obviously we're all caught up in this sort of daily come fast I mean every single newspaper every radio station every bit of social media\nTo make money too well that I said you got those man you got electric bills you got food you know this guy is he's giving all cash cash flow and the Trump era for a for these TV stations are\nThey going to say that might have been initially maybe instead of the nation for the people who are the bean counters that we're in the journal is we I think believe that our job is to\nNavigate the truth and to do the fact checking all the rest of this I think that's what most of the\nTopic [laughter] [noise] women are not going to live\nBy the ... to them and they dive in and what he's done well I thought his appeal to their own or sisters or\nThat's the line that's what I wanted to get to and that's what I Want to talk about coming up\nWhat Donald Trump has done to the media is appealed to their own nurse [noise] they're not firefighters charging into\nA flaming building\nThey are in our society as Rush Limbaugh noted years ago there are people who wanted to be in\nHollywood but we're too ugly so they settled for the\nRing is over until we find it is\nThat's not going to believe\nSeen anything like this is hello there\nThey may\n\nSay my money for the first George Rick curl\nAre ah C.

dollars per per team case you don't listen in the morning but would like to support a very good cause which is saint Jude this is the only thing\nOther than camp hope we do every year [noise] ah it's important to us if you're interested in supporting ... it's just a force some for golf tournaments summer third [noise]\nJust sent me an email through the website Michael berry showed\nThat you've got bill Michael berry show every show\nHe's the\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI live in a nut [noise] CNN evening broadcast [noise] he has a white\n[noise] boyfriend

something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nCNN has become the class clown they know nobody takes them seriously they just want the attention\nThey belong sense given up any hope of influence they just want attention and if you've ever been around a child with behavioral difficulties you know that sometimes they will do self defeating things\nIt says if they can't help themselves they just want the attention\nSmall business and that's why I tell folks if you hear a company advertised during my show and it's not in my boys\nThen that's not a show sponsored that somebody that paid our radio station money to talk to you because as I said earlier the qualitative is Hi you're the ultimate consumer and I'm not just saying that because you're listening to my show I'm saying that because the data backs that up your the ultimate consumer because you have money to spend\nYour very pro veteran pro law enforcement pro rule of law so you're the type of person is not look into scammer scheme somebody that comes to your house if you go to a restaurant you're not the type of person that goes to a restaurant each three quarters of the meal and sent it back and says there's hair in my food can you bring me another place\nThere are people who do that that's not who our listeners are listening some type of person that goes there\nPays a fair rate ... product expects to be treated fairly and it may have a better than ... will tell everybody to know about him and so that's what's managed to work so\nI Do appreciate you telling me that and for every one of you sends an email with a positive or negative response to having used one of our show sponsors remember show sponsor is somebody that I personally mention\nEven if you don't hear back from me know that that was forwarded to the company for their review positive or negative and I'm very proud of the fact that we have made that part of our business model and I think it's made our show better\nWe've made about Seventy five companies in Houston we have helped them move from one level up to the next level of success I'm very proud of that that's good for their families for their business and it's good for consumers now you know I mean I grew up in a small town when when it was time to get tires\nYou know go down to superior Tyrone sixteen\nWe knew the owner my dad would call Geri Michael's coming down on the bus and tires or what time only be or three o'clock All right I'll be waiting\nIt's hard to do that in a big city but we've been able to do that and create a small town feel in the big city and all and all it's worked for enough Ramon or we can afford to put food on the how 'bout that uh

were under the tradition of American patriots and it really feels good to kind of watch it\nIt does I I Will tell you it feels nice to see someone else on afraid of a fight I Am so tired of people telling me how patriotic and tell us they are and the minute some twenty three\nYear old girl accuses them on social media of being a racist they run and hide\nTired of it at least from the news that

your story last night was so beautiful and it's we need to be in this world and we need to touch one person the day\nJust like you do and we can turn things around and I think that when people hear
