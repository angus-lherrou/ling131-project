I Am twenty seven years old\nI had a and a total of twenty five hundred but I ... I found out that including my mortgage and out of\nAccess that and my question is what it'd be worth it to save an add on to my house for ... save and buy and so at least\nHave for the galley or if it would be more ideal pet say but\nIt's going to continue on sweets country every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused ... you know I now I Want to ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up and how you\nKnow add on to the house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical neither based in one day when I ... that you're living in worse\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would why spend about twenty grand just to add on an extra brown jak kids I work with children and that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over cell for what price range\nThey sell for about an between seven eight ten Ninety and the Upper East side as my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my ... my part is and\nAs somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you want to come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it just Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYou know and your mortgage in all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and where you are and how much of that is mortgage and how much of that other debt\nAnd there is only three thousand in the day and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nOkay and you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead free and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't think of myself by and I know that we plan on eliminating the access that\nNext night yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying a falling out twice and an extra fall now between the lowest my\nEggs if it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the ... edition done and you paid cash for the addition is that okay\nWell I mean that's where I'm kind of ... I just I Want to do with that\nI just started watching it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay\nPlan\nI think so because I I don't know if ever I was\nGood yeah I think you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you paid\nOff everything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years\nSo I think you've got a great plan I Would become free and then I Would save up and add on to my house you know more than twenty thousand make sure you get contractor beds and everything down and you know what you're getting into that puts this hour that I've Ramsey show in the books we will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember\nThere's really only one way or the financial piece of ... daily with\nPurpose of these crises\n\nGame 'cause we\nWhere they have to be here thank you for\nHelping a friend that\n\nWe use the phrase part of a teacher to describe our real estate ... because we only endorsed agents who care more about helping their clients that are earning a commission\nBut you don't have to take my word for it here's what Paul one of our listeners from Boise had to say about is a yellow be part of a teacher is the perfect description for Matthew the E.

just say Michael ... crudely put some science out here how about we look at the polling does how do we look at the historical ...\nOn your precinct and see that you're in an eighty five percent Republican precinct and that's not going to change this year either I was seeing more ... ...\nPeople get caught up in the things that don't matter the shining the cold people get caught\nUp in stuff that doesn't matter the size of crowds at concerts the size of rallies\nYou've got millions of people in Texas the fact that you can get five hundred of them to show up\nIn Amarillo or El Paso or Dallas or Houston for you to prance around and talk about how Nancy Pelosi should be the speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer should be the Senate majority leader and that's who you vote for that great\nBut that's not where the votes are\nAnd the media has a vested interest in telling you that the candidate they're supporting and endorsing and that they fall in love with is dead even or that he has taken the lead\nJust remember they're not to be trust period Dana you're on the go\nOh I Am so to speak to you Michael berry yes ma'am this is my first time\nCalling you I'm I'm I Want to comment on your comment about six people and the common thread being persistent for persevering\nI'm very interested in the subject mainly from the standpoint of programming your subconscious mind which when you are and you have a burning desire\nYour desire to tap and so all you have to do is never give up keep going after eight in spite of any evidence to the contrary you will get there if you just persevere\nYeah I'm I'm fascinated by the kind of mind over matter\nPhenomena and you know I look at people who run\nUltra marathon for instance I look at people look at a guy like Marcus will trail and he talks about the training they do is navy seals to get ready for war and to be able to persevere you know when your body is telling you that your bleeding out you've\nBeen shot multiple times you've fallen off the side of multiple mountains and you're probably going to die and everyone who came in with you has already died that the natural inclination is to shut down and simply die right there but the mind over matter to\nPush beyond that to push through that\nI'm Marcus has a friend named David ... they're doing the Patriot tour next month and I'm going to moderate Ramona pretty excited about and David dog in the navy seal he's one of the very few black maybe seals in America's ever had\nAnd he decided remember his story he decided he was like a hundred pounds overweight decides will start running\nAnd now he runs a ultra marathon hundred miles he runs a hundred miles your body is telling you it eggs he ran so far at one point that the bones in his feet were broken\nFrom the pounding and he continued on and his kidneys had shut down miles before and he continued through pushed through and finished the race\nMost of us our body is telling us through pain to stop\nAnd that you want to see a wall built\nThem keep illegal aliens out here\nBecause it's a bad idea to let people decide they're going to come into this country illegally which is why no other country on earth than allow taken there were no different than any of them\nWe just have a whole lot more\nPeople and so a whole lot more people\nTry and get\nWho built this country ... you're the good people who continue to make this country great in here the good people who are taking the time to go cast your vote and it is going to be a real rural or when you do then\nRan ran I see it coming I'm seeing in Texas I'm seeing folks saying to me you know I wasn't sure\nI was even going to vote on it I'm not as big cruise Spanish you or I thought ... you know was\nSaying some pretty things and he was visiting the state needs young and he's a smooth and he's cool he's here\nHe's no different than any other Democrats are they just packaged him differently avenue now yeah you can put lipstick on a pig ... pig\nAnd this one doesn't even provide any bike down\nTo the phone lines we go Robin in Beaumont go ahead\nMichael require ... you know right try it how many Democrats weren't that actually work\nIn Anchorage at nine you while you're offered it I don't think any I don't eat or\n\nIf they want it back yes they do yeah\nYes they do Bradley in Alabama Europe\nAll right Mike are you there yeah go ahead I I got a a\nLittle story for you is a a man that I got home with every day and they keep me company uh we tell stories back and forth and uh I usually end up listening to him he's got a lot of wisdom and been through a lot in life been around for quite some time\nAnd uh of listening to him yesterday and\nHe told a story on it provided a metaphor that I felt like sharing year and everybody uh listening\nAnd had we got to talking about on gay and coming into the White House and how strong the media was about an hour on such a bad thing we got totally repel everything that he says and uh he he provided this metaphor that\nKind of sums up black community and the Democrats and uh I think you agree with it or not it for ... you may recognize his name is yours truly Michael berry and uh I thought that was the most accurate\nAnd really in to it if it's a picture\nOf the current state of the Democratic party and the black community that I've heard ... date and I'll watch the news every night and everything like that so I I Would like to talk\nTo you Mr Perry and curators\nArgument I appreciate you saying that you know I Will tell you politics is played very differently\nIn what is frequently called the black community by which I mean the parts of town that are predominantly black\nBlack community as a geo graphic representation means something different than black community at large short of black nation type thing blacks who live outside of predominantly black neighborhoods don't get counted in voting patterns\nBecause voting patterns are based on precincts and when you go to a precinct that is an\nAll black or almost all black\nPrecinct it is typically although not exclusively a poor precinct if blacks live in a neighborhood where over Ninety percent of the people are black\nIt is more often than not a poor neighborhood when blacks are financially successful professionally and then financially successful\nThey will typically move out of a black neighborhood and then they move into a predominantly white neighborhood so their vote never gets cast\nAs part of the quote unquote black community well here's the deal\nWhen people refer to the black community there actually\nReferring to depressed areas that have a high concentration of blacks I got news for you if you go to a predominantly white neighborhood that is socio economically poor\nThe voting patterns the positions on issues are going to be quite different than if you go to a mostly white neighborhood where the income is much higher\nSo what happens is people have missed perceptions of blacks and what Kanye is doing is actually laying that bear [noise]\nOne of the world a better place if every groan asked men and lesbian woman\nThe top on the drive home you bet it would\nOh\nOh\nI was the first Republican elected in the city of Houston\nWe have ... elections that are technically nonpartisan you don't put your\nOn your candidacy but they know and my opponent was a very outspoken Democrats she was a woman they tried to use that\nShe was very pro choice so the Planned Parenthood abortion lovers where big supporters of her\nUm it was ... it hadn't been done a Republican had not been elected citywide in the city of Houston they might say Houston Houston as a Republican place\nThey're done the entire power structure is done and a lot of people are vested in that and that's really dangerous egg Europe go ahead\nGo ahead and make you sick or something because I Know how you are\nBecause I Want to talk about that they do commercial where he sounds so exasperated and him and he goes you know got negative attack and you don't understand what we're trying to do for the state and when he says they like that um like at the state I mean it's frightening that distance chills that I buy when I hear that question\nUm yeah they're spending a fortune on enemy he's raised a lot of money from California and New York there there are people trying to buy the Senate said um if they could win Texas it would be a coup for them and they're going to throw every dollar they have it but when it comes down to it there's one simple question\nAs a United States senator would you vote for or against Chuck Schumer as the Senate majority leader\nAnd his answer is yes there's no way around that and Texas do not want that Texas do not want Chuck Schumer who you will remember laughed at the state of Texas forget about it I remember that line\nI remember when Chuck Schumer\nTaunted Texans\nOver the space shuttle remember we should have had the space shuttle here 'cause we're the NASA Headquarters but he had more political clout under Morocco bombing because we had two Republican senators and what did he say\nHe said it's coming to Texas and if you think you I was coming to New York and if you think you're going to get that from us because we have the political clout and you don't forget about it that was his line that was his taught to Texans and I\nWill tell you Texans were furious at the time and there is no way they are going to vote for Beto O'Rourke so that he can make Chuck Schumer the Senate majority leader and punish us again the way Brock Obama did\nRemember when Barack Obama got off the plane and refused to meet with Rick Perry so Rick Perry brought him\nBrought the letter to him\nAbout what was going on in our southern border and when needed federal assistance on our southern border he gave that letter to Obama because that way he could show that letter to the media and say this is what I wanted to tell but rock Obama but he didn't want to listen\nBecause when Barack Obama comes to Texas\nHe didn't come here to meet with citizens he didn't come here to tour the wildfire that at the time was ravaging the state he came here to drag the bag amongst the rich plaintiffs' lawyers who were supporting him\nHe knew he didn't have any votes here he lost by sixteen percentage points to to Mitt Romney he was here to pick up a bunch of cash and then go to the places that actually vote for him like New York and California and win Texans stop and think about do you want to help Chuck Schumer run the United States Senate\nDo you want that to be because you know what\nDonald Trump has been more successful at this point in his presidency than any president in history at putting judges on the bench more successful than any president in history\nTwo days ago oh no it was actually yesterday the Senate confirmed Fifteen Trump judicial nominees three circuit court twelve district court now the Supreme Court gets all the attention\nBut these are the cases that will be appealed up in a few of which will come before the Supreme Court\n[noise] these judges will shape the future of this nation\nTrump's confirmed judges in his presidency so far remember he's not even two years into it to Supreme Court justices [noise] twenty Ninth Circuit court judges fifty three district court judges that's a record that's a record\nBy quite a distance for those of you who voted for Trump because he would be able to appoint a Supreme Court and a point or judges pat yourself on the back big victory [noise]\nHey this is a ... of their route up in ... oh scholarship his way to to log agree including one from Matt in Bahrain a three year old town a lawyer and\nBunch of ... air\nYour seatbelt [noise] uh your co when they get ready to put them all up missing them Michael there\n\nI'm On\nThe bottom a shovel to New York had no business getting you know political favor instead of Houston home to NASA\nThan Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said this to the people of Texas\nI've heard that used in is making a big pet to get NASA to reverse it fell\nLet me say\nLet me say to use than what we say in Brooklyn [noise]\nThey are not getting the shuttle\nWe're fighting for it and we're going to keep it [noise]\nAnd I said to use the people in use that\nWhen people all around the world in London\n... that way no sorry say gee I Can't wait\nFor my trip to you\nThey in in New York\n[noise] you hear that\nThat's the senator from New York you want to know why they're raising so much money from New York for ... ...\n... New York because if they do is elected he will make their senator way more powerful because New York once they're senator to be the Senate majority leader\nAnd that's why they're spending all this money ... thirty eight million dollars for Bayh though New York thirty eight", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Berry", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
