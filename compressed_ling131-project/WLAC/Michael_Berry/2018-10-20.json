[laughter] she's on a date I Can't figure out\n\nAre you on the deed I'm also not how did she get on the deed [noise] um my sister\nHas um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to lead so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying the it was your mother paying the mortgage\nShe's been not any more I was\n... yeah I told my sister I Would not anymore yeah everything

and her name [noise] um and she has said that she can't because her deposits too high uh-huh 'cause she doesn't tend to pay her bills so they raised to deposit too you know compensate for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill\nRight yes okay just to pay the bill that\nAnd that's it and she used to pay the mortgage today yeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand of the debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away\nYeah okay so we don't worry about those ... paying a shaded that we're paying the students that quip\nPaint student loans so now I got eleven thousand dollars in some medical bills\nThat does the rest of it we're just not paying\nYour mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got the ... twenty eight thousand dollars a year she sixty three years old you're living in an apartment we have to make sure she's cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say a car and here does she need to be driving\n[noise] I say no you're the power of attorney yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollar car 'cause fifty eight hundred dollars is a lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving\nRight now I Can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the time she forgot how did you get home that's what started it\n\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt\nOr to hurt someone for\nGod's sakes definitely not she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee from Wisconsin\nAnd we'd have one of those silver alerts or whatever they call them right yeah\nYeah no I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to do\nYour job has the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of\nUpsets your sisters\nUpset your mother's upset I don't care\nYeah it's very hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself\nOkay\nSo that all the student loan people they get dizzy up nothing nada okay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car now I'm Down to just a few medical\nBills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm she has a pension annuity for security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nOkay I was ... and the high paid fifty on laugh on each one\nAnd it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks shuttles a whole dead or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get\nNothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attach an annuity\nAnd so that she is what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets in her only income which pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell him I said that from Utah natural coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nAnd play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here yeah I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by up on trying to hurt anybody I'm trying to protect your mom\nIn the last thing I think that she ... she gets her food paid her lights and water her rent and she is taking care of only than do we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gets nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying this real kind of like 'cause I Want you to get all that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard conversations for you yeah but you got to be our cars at your mom you're protecting okay exactly you can do it you can do it if
