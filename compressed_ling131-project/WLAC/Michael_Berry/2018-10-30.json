{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "A he'll be twenty eight okay\nI'm ... ... what is one of the nature what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land okay\nI'm In a in a\nArm what leg okay All right\nAnd I'm not to minimize that 'cause that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[laughter]\nYeah and you know I think basically what's been happening is there's been any different disputes back and forth and counter suing going on by lawyers\nAnd that's all that's all behind us you think now you think this was coming to a head\nI think that I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been for the shady things going on in the court cases\nWells with twenty million dollars is they're going to they're going to mess with it you can count on that [noise] yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\nI think honestly he just wants to be working he wants to have you back at work\nHe doesn't want to be going to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now they won't be doing heavy lifting things or something like that probably right\nExactly that's that's the hope except for he's got a desire to do those kinds of things so it's really killing him to do that around\n... around but I mean I'm you know usually actually make more money with your mind that you do with your body anyway\nRight as a career path so generally speaking is er that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I I think he he gets to sit down and ask themselves that question what do\nI Want to do if I could do anything in the world because now he can do anything in the world [noise] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money because they won't take as much of that a small percentage of that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training in X or y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there or whatever those things are that he wants\nTo do so what's he want to be when he's fifty five years old that he's made his life's work and his career and he gets to choose that now that's awesome can be a self employed track that could be a a a track of uh some kind of a a a\nI don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically um demanding okay\nRight [laughter] that's okay that's okay in terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now he's getting all these ideas and they have no water that acts implication on something like this that you've known to be facing with [noise]\nIt depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and with some tax advice to find out how it's structured I shouldn't be in California as well\nThat's correct yeah\nThat that's the first thing you need to figure out what the taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're going to I Would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nI mean you have if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just to use a number okay and you know if he pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen making that you're just pretend like you're not there\nThat makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you could buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of free money okay so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the\nUh in in the abundance of counsellors there's safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors\nHe needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer he needs a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs and investment person in his corner I'm ... probably you when someone else sitting there that will look at him and telling me stupid when he's being stupid\n[noise] and he needs to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because yeah white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not that do it for you but the coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing it then that's how I get ... right\nAnd and and I don't want you doing it by yourself because you're probably not completely equipped\nBut we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board right we've got a CPA we gotta stay plan or we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person the mutual funds world and then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nThey get they get a ten million dollar signing bonuses and they're really good at football but they are not really good money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost and million dollars here's how you do it you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and God you as a group\nYou don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut then and they need to say they need we'll look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments them forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes and decides to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose at all by the ... three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah that's what I'm afraid of two young I'm\nSo don't do that you know don't don't don't open the twenty million dollar business don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business is very small he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time either tortoise don't be the hair\nAnd just take your time put a group of counselors and the multitude accounts for safety put a group of counselors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that\nCan speak to you teach you and how old is he today twenty eight so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue okay yeah\nAlong the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars\nIn it'll take ten years for him to intellectually and emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all if he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money\nI'm going to open a chain of pizza parlors all gone [laughter] it's all gone yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone\nIt's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree for the you know for generations to come\nBecause he's wise with it does that make sense\nYes thank you very much appreciate all the five\nMaybe that's exactly what we would do if we were in a situation appreciate your call and\nThanks to James child's Kelly Daniels and Blake Thompson I Am Dave Ramsey your host we'll be back with you before you know and in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's the daily with the prince of these crises\n\nHey it's Kelly Daniel says he ... he says that ... million dollars in cash [laughter] pretty ... year this year listening for more interesting [noise]\nNo one works as hard as business
