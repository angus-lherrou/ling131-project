... dollars\nSo it makes sense yeah\nSo I mean first thing we got to do is make sure you have enough to pay cash is that what you're talking about that you're going to have an up and pay some down the student loans or what\nThat's what I was trying to figure out like you have a foul something between Fifteen and twenty grand between now and then the next fall when I go back to school and I've got knocked on the loan so I didn't know saving\nWell first thing is what is the first thing the first goal is complete school be a hundred percent sure have way more than enough to complete school with no new debt now when do you finish school at the end of next year\nIt'll take about a year and a half\nAnd then your degree will be and what\nAre your business management is\nOkay and I'm\n... move you up in income immediately are you working now what's your story\nYeah I've been I've been in and out of school I've got a management job now but I don't really see it being able to advance means like higher leadership off all that kind of my reach me for one could go back to school to finish\nNo car well it's it's not a bad thing to finish up what you're doing I think that's a good plan but yeah the the first goal is to finish with no new debt and make plenty sure you got plenty more than enough to do that but let's say that you add it up and you say I Need twenty thousand dollars to finish\nAll of my school and then you save up thirty thousand and then you save up\nAnother ten thousand I wouldn't I mean Thirty's more if twenties all you need thirty is plenty that gives you up ad then everything above that you start paying off the debt if you got really really into the money you see what I'm saying but I mean I wouldn't be I wouldn't have two dollars extra one a little extra to make sure you get\nThrough school with no new debt that your first big goal now when you get out of school then we're going to attack this debt with a vengeance and that's going to be the process but um that that\nThat's just what we tell people don't don't go further in is your first call Jeffrey is in Atlanta Georgia Hi Jeffrey how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I have a I work for a company that had the weak support while and I will be paying if I give to the program I Will be paying one twenty [noise] uh I pay period oh have you been to lead a program but\nThey worked in my car manufacturer ... maybe you weren't ... what do you work for a BMW okay that is not a normal leasing program this was an Employee Benefit okay and it is excellent\nBecause they furnish the car at a cost that there's there's no way you could have hardly any car for no more than you're paying I mean ... ... you said two hundred and forty dollars right as three thousand dollars a year okay if you bought that car will go down three thousand dollars and twenty minutes in value\nYa author you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and do they not punish liked a Tarzan oil and stuff to do any user is the gas even furnished and that they can't remember no no no there's one on one of the car manufacturers emerged but it's it's ... it's ... it's all the maintenance and the tires low right\nEverything is the insurance and that to\nYou have to see that's a deal of deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year after that\nBut at least it's not like a standard okay they call it a lease but it's more of an employee benefits in other words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you to your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits and they want their employees drive in one of their fine automobiles and you've got to do make a fine automobile so yeah and\nIf I remember ... you have what a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up to a certain\nAmount to buy a car no car the one that you liked or whatever yeah okay All right well dude it's a deal I mean seriously you know ... you can't hardly buy insurance for that\nMuch less the Tarzan maintenance much Leslie Lawson value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and releasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month okay you know and that would\nNot be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it 'cause it's a good car but you're you're getting an Employee Benefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I worked for beamer\nIt's a bargain it's a great deal and there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it of if I was driving you know if you're driving ten thousand dollar car man\nYou can't do that for three thousand dollars a year\nWas what we're talking about here and you're certainly not driving up ten thousand dollar car what we're describing your probably driving forty thousand dollar car\nSo a good question my thank you for calling in and um again there's a great deal appreciate your joining us Amy is on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by\nEven though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can\nAfford most anything I Want to do nowadays I mean not anything but most anything and some things just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that\nUm I've got a friend that's worth um\nTens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um a hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch which sounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars that's just like most people buying a biscuit okay I can afford to do that it just I just\nI don't know it's not me number one and I um I I might spin on a boat [laughter]\nBut not all watch so I mean you know it is just being authentic with you you know but\nUh uh so\nThe boats bigger than ... count [laughter] so you know it just it's something that hits me funny but it's not really a value Judgement to say that my point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending that ... she's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if he spends a hundred and fifty grand on I'll watch it's nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his is a general ... huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally yeah I ... I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't grasp it\nAh emotionally it it would be wrong to do it if it's a high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your you know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand dollars for the cars will that's just stupid\nThat they can make a value Judgement on that does not emotions just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just don't feel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it as my point\nThe moderate [noise]\nA moderate and after we drop envision hammer\n\n[laughter]\nAh it's good when you can catch 'em say in what they don't want their supporters back home to hear [noise] let's move over to Arizona were a few years ago ... the uh at ... Democrat front runner there this is what she said about the state of Arizona\nTo people now what's happening in Arizona and not a good way and we're not seen in making a good way we're kind of making

saint Stacey Abrams says that part of the blue wave is going to be the illegal aliens\nThe thing that is a blue wave is African Americans\nOh the undocumented are part of your voting group meanwhile Hillary as defending bill\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult but let me\nWho was an adult but she's had that conversation a timer ten then let's move over to Texas where the great hope\nFor the Democrats was white liberal bagel roar and here's to MSNBC commentators last night talking about him and how they raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter and the more money he raises the war she's doing\nThe work is just blowing the roof off with small dollar donations thirty million in the last three months alone he spent ... million already on TV ads against Ted Cruz but the latest New York times poll shows him trailing cruise by eight points\nAnd does quite often down now and what he's he's achieved for that money as he is now the most unpopular statewide official in the er state wide figure in the ... is that what's going on here yet is he is absolutely because he has sort of national figure he's taken stance that do a great job raising money from a national liberal base\nBut always done is just cannibal eyes money that would have gone to Heidi Heitkamp or Claire McCaskill or other Democrats I could've said their seats that are probably not going to go down in the wild workers on this ban any mission and it's just that it's just basically flushing money down the toilet\nFrom a from a very real standpoint they're allies have a cat who would love nothing more I hear it all the time when I'm Out in the campaign trail they would love to think Ted Cruz looms sending money but that's\nWhere we literally just having a conversation\nI was like heroin made a mistake by nationalizing this campaign look\nMean times are all about the state here and you want to take your debate and put on a national cable networks you want it to be local I talked about in Georgia we got the the bums break him very invading at home you got he got hoarse some other debates may actually happen at all when you want to make yourself a national candidate that's a manatee project it does become a bit of\nMany projects and it does and press the people in this doesn't mean a bed or war was ever going to have a chance\nAnd he wasn't but boy they sure hope they would and the good news is he sucked all the money into Texas where he's not going to win which was money they could've used\nTo buy other Senate seats where it might have made a difference\nA Senate seat as a citizen see it as a Senate seat doesn't matter what state is from [noise] they're gonna under fund their close races where they actually had a chance I'm not complaining I Love the fight [noise] and I love the fact that ... had to turn down Brock Obama's endorsement last week\nBut he's already

you to pay for my plug in court fees please stage name and your clients name Michael ... and my client Stormy Daniels okay then it'll be five hundred\nAnd twenty five dollars in court costs plus your opponents legal fees okay and my client would like to know if she can pay the bill exclusively with single dollar bills would that you'll pay [laughter]\n\nDay Michael ...\nPresidential candidate and

maybe he's just being a boy he not boys are\nOr maybe he's paving oh poor baby I think incomes hurt maybe he's just tired or maybe is coming hurt he didn't eat that much maybe he's not ... you think maybe\nIt was a dog maybe I'll throw it maybe it's a face maybe he just doesn't like smiling maybe he has autism and we can definitely do see\nA\nHave you seen the show got friend is\nHaven't seen it either [noise] there's a follow up\nBut the volume was turned down [noise]\nIs it still turn down this fall on CBS it's God printed me the story of a young man who was an outrageous podcast about atheism and then one day got friends in my face for\nAbout the whole area's new shows things on my Instagram\nOh look same just post the new album\nThe cat\nThat gossiping yeah he's always person weird video check this one out [noise]\nAlso hey what's up guy\nOil for some reason I'm having with my ... one nine Ninety nine possibly throwing the shipping for free\nDirt on it gave her an extra qualification but here's the problem faculty positions like most other things particularly in public life in in ... in government faculty positions or zero sum game\nIf Elizabeth Warren got that job does that mean someone else didn't and even if\nYou buy into the nonsense that you need to have women of color on the faculty for the sole purpose of being a woman of color or not because that person is the best but if you say well we got to hire us one non white woman\nAnd here comes this white woman I'm a non white white woman if you say so that's\nWhy she has to maintain the lie because her whole career is based on that why you see that she's ... she's into deep at this point she can't get out\nBut the worst part is some black woman some Hispanic woman out there didn't get that teaching job because white liberal Elizabeth Warren did the white liberals always owned the minorities lung\nYou know\nYou've got your show\n\nOver\nShoulder and Halloween [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] oh I\nThink when you don't want to be treated\nAll that [noise]\nI don't want to be outside of just three in the morning [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nYou need any more I think also\nDon't want to see if we can find something that\n[noise]\nIf there is any one in the country who has earned the right to speak\nAbout\nViolence against public officials has to be Steve Scully was almost assassinated he will suffer for the rest of his life so in addition to everything else going wrong for the Democrats to smear they\nPulled on Brett Kavanaugh the way they conducted themselves in addition to all of that they also have a violence problem\nWhere you know you're seeing more and more of this from the left and and there's no place for them\nWhat I wrote about was that when you see these kinds of things being said it is inciting people and frankly it's not the direction that we should be going it's not what our country is all about they were great country\nThat that celebrates the fact we can actually disagree with each other we can disagree with our government but there was a way to resolve but the result your differences at the ballot box you'd don't resort to violence and the leaders calling on violence that happens in third world nations not an America Congress and why did you decide to write the out that [noise]\nWell I Am concerned that you're seeing an increase of this uh you know look I Would like to see leaders on both sides calling it out your stand leaders on on the right calling it out you're not seeing any leaders on the left call laid out in fact you're seeing some of the leaders on the left\nIs citing more violence calling on more violence instead of saying there's no place for it I'd I'd like to see the mainstream media asking both Republican and Democrat leaders to stand up against this kind of rhetoric this kind of violence\nCongressman Scully Maxine Waters just works across the hall from you in a figure of speech you know your work in the same building have you ah have you thought about going over to her office in saying what are you talking about what are you doing [noise] you know I've\nTalked to some Democrats about this and and there are a lot of Democrats that are concerned about it I I like to hear some of them speaking out publicly because I think that's what it's going to take but why the rhetoric to her directly sir\nI've spoken to a number of them directly and and I think the ones who have spoken to a you know some of them get it some of them do but\nUltimately we've got to keep shining a light on this to make it clear that this isn't what politics is about in America it's not what the founding of our country was about it was about freedom of speech freedom of expression not violence against anybody\nWhat level of shameless ... do you have to do to the jurors somehow blaming this man\nWho was shot multiple times\nCrawling himself ... ... mostly pero us through the infield the softball field\nWhere a Bernie borough\nHas unloaded how many rounds into his body how many surgeries has he had thirty forty fifty he'll never be the same again he's in constant pain limited movement\nHow ... how his his guts are shredded\nAnd you're going to ask him well how come you don't go don't match the water's why don't you go tell her dark place how are you you bastard how dare you say that to this man like he hasn't done enough\nThey have an openly communist member of the uh\nSeattle city is a communist or social is I'd read as a matter openly is the important part\nWell after Seattle did that and then rescinded at San Francisco's having their whole ... next month the city will vote on proposition ...\nWhich will raise over three hundred million dollars to add to the already three hundred eighty million dollars per year the city spends on their homeless problem\nHowever instead of a levy on the number of employees proposition C is essentially another income tax for companies that call the city home [noise]\nThe new mayor of San Francisco London Breed has said she has problems with the lack of accountability and the measure apparently the proposition does not provide enough checks and balances on how to account for the three hundred million dollars raised oh don't worry how the money spent\nJust make sure we got a lot of it nobody ever looks at how we spend the money on the homeless\nIt's all how we can get more of it quote by dramatically increasing our homelessness spending without working with neighboring counties proposition C could put us in the ... tenable she says the untenable inexpensive position\nOf funding services for residents from other counties\n[noise] San Francisco cannot solve homelessness simply by writing ever larger checks itself\nThere is a limit to what we should and can spend ... ...\nWhat you can spend on the homeless oh no this can't happen there can never be a limit to what you spend on the children on the homeless\nOn the environment there is an unlimited amount because rich people\n[noise] apparently um mayor breed is figured out that the more money you spend on homelessness which by the way this is true\nThe more homeless you have I've told the story on air before so forgive me if you've heard this multiple times but Ted Koppel did a special in Houston a few years ago almost city council at the time we got to be there [noise]\nAnd it was comparing homelessness in Houston to homelessness in San Francisco\nAnd they took to people who were homeless in San Francisco and two people who were homeless in Houston and they compared the resources [noise]\nIf you're homeless in Houston you can sleep on the street which violates our vacancy loss or you can go to one of the I'm a non profit organizations like star of hope great organization that will take\nYou and then put you give you a three ... caught you can eat and keep the rain and cold off of you [noise] um\nAnd it's the basics right you're homeless but it it's enough to keep you alive at its it's humane it's compassionate it is Christian literally it is a Christian based organization and then there are some others but star hope is probably the most prominent in and I I think probably the most effective\nIn the greater Houston community so the homeless guys in in Houston they get a place to stay and they get food\nUm and that's that's it right because we were not big believe you know we're not going to build\nA castle for you [noise] and then they went to the to homeless people they chose at random in San Francisco and life was really good they were getting so much more\nIn fact the homeless out reached there it's almost as if they make homelessness inducted into a job being homeless is like your career can live pretty well off of it\nBut I don't tell you that the point that out because you would have expected\nThe city of San Francisco rather than spending on roads and police and the things that matter it's going to have higher taxes and more goodies\nFor the homeless in fact so many goodies for the homeless that some people\nWho are homeless end up moving from places like Houston to San Francisco for a better job if you will the job of being homeless\nThe two people they chose were from Houston\nThey were homeless from Houston the homeless like every other community has their network they pass information the kittens good in San Francisco\nSo they hop a greyhound bus and they get to San Francisco and they immediately show up signing up no questions asked and they have a whole new career in beautiful San Francisco\nAnd what we learn from that\nIs that you can become what is known in the law as an attractive nuisance you can you can induce the very behaviors you don't want\nBy subsidizing them there's a famous public policy study known as the Indian cobra effect\nThey had a problem in an Indian Village with cobra is so they paid you to bring in for every cobra you brought in they found that the more they paid out the more\nWe're going to see this and just because of the people that run city governments in places like Houston Dallas walk\nTo grow up to San Francisco when they're adults um that's that's what the that's where they they they salivating over the thought of of a straw bans and things of a short\n\nJames wolf former security director for the Senate intelligence committee\nHas pleaded guilty to one count of giving a false statement to the FBI when there was an investigation into the leaks from the Senate intelligence committee to reporters Mm that's interesting\nWolfgang some degree of notoriety when it was discovered that he had been and they may September relationship with New York times reporter alley Watkins\nThe two had been an item for about three years before she joined the paper Wolfe was in charge of maintaining all classified information coming from the executive branch to the Senate panel\nHe served as the panels security director for twenty nine years that's a long time and it goes all the way back to George H W. Bush Bush forty one\n[noise] his guilty plea should be noted for some things that it is not\nNumber one Wolfe was never charged with leaking documents to the media he was only charged with lying about contact with the media [noise] do you think he was sleeping with the New York times reporter\nAnd having contact with her that he was denying and not sharing\nYou'd think she was sleeping with him because she wanted an old man to sleep with or you think she was sleeping with him because it helped her career she was an ambitious girl\nIn the indictment the department of justice does not specify

intelligence committee security director exchange with reporters including the one he was sleeping with [noise]\n[noise]\nVery interesting why didn't they charge him with that [noise]\nSo Michael ... saw not wasting money over the years I've seen so many people overspend on their auto went home insurance and have their own coverage\nIt's hard to find the best deal since typically you have to go to one company at a time share all your personal info and then end up with just one quote since bats all most companies offer\nNot Zander insurance they shop over a dozen top companies to find you the best options and more options means more savings\nThey also keep shopping every year to make sure your rates stay [noise]\nYesterday I played for you\nHillary Clinton last defense of [noise]\nHer husband bill in the Monica Lewinsky case and she says to clinch jaw the Monica was in the oh you can tell it's just not something she thinks she should have to be talking about\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now while there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult but let me ask\nYou this where the investigation of the current incumbent\nWell the current incumbent um has not been accused of sexual harassment as president\nFirst of all as they point out in the ... she was interviewed by stars investigators they did not include her in the case for impeachment\nBecause the case for impeachment was related to certain causes and her case was not part of that so while they did interview her and they put a footnote it was not widely known at the time\nThe Congress Mindy representatives who voted to impeach did read the report and did see the the the written version of her testimony it is very credible it is very credible\nUh there were even some Democrats that were that were concerned about this\nAnd then of course the Senate did not you had to have two thirds of the senators vote to impeach and uh they only got forty five of them still rather significant number of people voted to impeach him when he stayed in office but one by a lot [noise]\nBut what's very interesting about that is in Nineteen Ninety eight year all this comes out the impeachment Monica Lewinsky something interesting happened Hillary\nHillary had been very unpopular since Nineteen Ninety two\nYou'll remember during the presidential campaign she was a different kind of first lady she was she was very into policy she was very she was on like the bride the why that is they're raising the children and has a social cause and she was out there saying what she was going to do the healthcare\nAnd and she was quite different she she took a different role member she said I I didn't just stay home and baked cookies or I'm not I'm not ... net stand by your man she said some things that made especially stay at home was uncomfortable\nHer popularity was low and then Hillary care which was the precursor to Obamacare made her even less popular [noise] something interesting happened in Nineteen Ninety eight because of the Monica Lewinsky scandal\nWomen began to feel bad for her\nWomen began to feel\nThat she was in a bad position\nShe was supporting her husband maybe for the good of the country maybe for the good of his career maybe for the good of her child may be for whatever reason that this was a tough thing for her to do that that she had nowhere to go\nThat leaving him would destroy the White House and that she was soldier ring on and her public approval begins to climb\nAnd during that time it would reach a high that was higher than it ever been or ever would\nBegin sixty seven percent two thirds of Americans felt favorably toward Hillary Clinton\nAnd that's really what ends up launching her to the New York Senate campaign and then of course to the presidential campaign that was the moment when Hillary went from Bill Clinton's\nA unpopular wife ... real a little too pushy may be mean to being the woman who had been wronged and women sympathized with her condition\nWhich is interesting because I had forgotten counted the perception of how that whole thing worked out well another little tidbit Ramon\nJuanita Broderick refused to speak to the special investigation in fact she had to be subpoenaed\nIn order to come and speak to can stars folks and at first she said she hadn't been raped she didn't want to be part of all she didn't want her family it had all occurred in the late seventies she didn't want her family to be dragged into all this\nBut her friends at the time said no no no she told us all to of her friends she told that day that she'd been raped that's pretty powerful to not wait to Twenty years but to say it at that time well the private investigators who were put on the
