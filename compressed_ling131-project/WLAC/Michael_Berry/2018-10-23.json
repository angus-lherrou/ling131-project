{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Okay good and um okay the uh the thing is is\nYou want to keep an emergency fund up three to six months of expenses are probably keep one of six months worth of expenses and no one's forcing anybody to invest in anything um the the thing I finally figured out and they took me a long time to get there and it may take you a little while to get there is that buying a mutual fund\nIs not risky and does not keep me up at night\nIf I understand that mutual fund and its track record let me give you an example of how I Know that would be true for you you bought two houses\nNeither time does anyone give you a guarantee that they would not go down in value\nThat day and they might have actually gone down in value back in two thousand I\nBut you didn't get scared and sell them as you thought well real estate a workout you know now that's what that means is you're looking at the track record of real estate not the guarantee because there's not one\nI'm looking at the track record and going you know I'm Seventy three I've watched houses go up my whole life sometimes I go down but most of the time they go up and if I go down I'm not going to panic and they'll come back up\nAnd that is looking at the track record you might not have had the actual numbers memorized but good walking around since ... means you observe really goes up in value over time right\nRight and so that's what I needed about mutual funds were some good walking around sense or one of the very first ones I ever bought\nWas Seventy five year old mutual fund and um it's got an average annual return over Seventy five years at a little over eleven percent\nNow that's the average some years it went down some years it went up but for me that was kind of like buying a house on the street with big trees\nI felt like that's a pretty stable neighborhood oh and out of the last ten years it'd only been when I bought it back then I mean it only lost money to two out of ten times all the other years have made money and over the scope of ten years it made money\nSo it was pretty calm\nIn income type mutual fund and when I was looking at was the track record and going okay I Know there's risk in the stock market and I know stupid people lose all their money in the stock market 'cause they buy some little stupid company and the company goes on and they lose all their money because they're just playing with a golfing buddy\nAnd there but I'm looking at a mutual fund here that's invested in Ninety two hundred different stocks it has a Seventy year track record as a you know tenured drag or even twenty or ... and I can actually look at it and go okay what's it averaged over the last ten years what's your leverage over the last Twenty years and how many times has actually been down\nNow is that a guarantee that it won't go down in the future which is not a guarantee but your house wasn't either [noise] and if your house did go down one time out of ten years or one time to three times out of Twenty years you wouldn't panic you'd hold on to the house and you know let it come back up and that's how I first got\nComfortable with mutual funds because you know Rick in my late twenties I went broke and lost everything I don't like losing money on like risk but I also don't like money invested in or sitting in an account making one percent when it could be making ten or twelve\nAnd ... and so if I got a mutual fund this average eleven percent four Seventy five years\nAnd it only does half\nOf what it used to do well that still five and a half percent pass I mean it's got a really shock to go do half of what it's done for Seventy five years it's got to be really bad I mean it's like\nThe the worst possible ... period of time you know so uh I'm a beat my savings account I'm a beach or annuity I'm gonna beat everything if it\nDoes and that gave me a lot of comfort and and you know and again\nOn but but the reason you're lying awake at night is you didn't think about in terms of track record and knowledge\nOf history will give you peace on investments it'll allow you to sleep well and and so just take your time and learn take your time and learn if you need some help sit down with one of our smart buster pros we will not endorsed people and they're not people that worked for ... us but we don't endorse the smart Mr pros unless they have the heart of a teacher\nBecause we don't want you to invest money in light white and I I don't want you to that I think it's that means you didn't understand what you invest in or you did understand and you put it in some stupid\nOr you shouldn't be lying awake at night with your investments just like you shouldn't be lying awake when you bought the house in Texas you bought your home should be laying awake at night I was with that and so\nIf you go on the website ... um put in your information will drop down a list a smart rushed her prose in your area so that I'm Talking when I'm there is no obligation just learn more knowledge you have about something\nThe more calm you are about it\nIt's as simple as something like driving a car\nThe very first time I got behind the wheel of a car I think I was probably about ten years old ... told me I could move the car down the driveway and um the gravel driveway and I think I emptied all of the gravel out of the driveway because I think I've just stepped on the accelerator floor border to end just dug a hole what the ... of the guard\nAnd the first time ever drive a car you remember how nervous your weather is in a field or in a parking lot and then the first time you drive on on the road you remember how nervous you were ... and then but you know what I'm thinking about it now your ... your brain auto pilots the car is or what happens is you have learned to do something that\nHas risk because you can record car there's no guarantee it has risk what you've learned to do it and the knowledge and the practice has given you a piece and you do it without your heart rate even change and you don't lay awake at night on a cashier I drove a car tomorrow\nIt don't it doesn't bother you even though you're

looking at the super expensive apartments he's going into these corporate managed things where they've got a twenty eight year old managing the apartment or the twenty four year old managing the
