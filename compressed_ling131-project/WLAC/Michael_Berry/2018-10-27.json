I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where'd you get your values are those private cell values are wholesale or a dealer offer what\nAre those are trade and values okay so you could actually sell them for more than that possibly guess\nHow's your credit oh no you definitely could you ... you saw it for more than ... ... value I mean you saw for price sale amount on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nAnd I want to have you all this money to these these two car loans where the loans\nI Believe they're both through Ford Motor credit for it\nSo you've not got an easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all and her name then\nYes uh-huh okay [noise] mhm\nAnd you don't you're going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then there's other car deal is going to be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty\n... twenty four that gives you about three to throw at the oh the deal and the Eighteen is probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two shows on white man and the whole if those are trading values\nUm managed to raise your only about six and the whole here um that's yeah that's not the end of the world um I I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had a value of under ten thousand dollars\nOkay and when you're in the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's uh let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd buying our bike you try to sell it for me I'm going to gas and say let's say for instance it would bring twenty twenty four that puts three in your pocket unless bought three thousand dollar car with that\nOK okay and um then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrow the difference\nFrom the credit union and your wife's name\nWas her credit ... and that gets you a three hour car in a hoop the\nBut she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with a student loans much you're making one twenty six year you can do that and within a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up in car once we're out of debt and have your emergency found in place\nSo we're not going to drive these who peace but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years so I'm\nOkay and that gets you clear but you know your car poor you have a car mess on your hands you're right to observe that and um\nYou know at a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trade in with the dealer though\nYou're going to make a lot less on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not 'cause they're evil or something they just have to run cell by car and make a profit they don't they're not in the break even business during the profit business\nAnd so um you know a trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast it could throw a difference in five or six thousand bucks in this discussion\nEasy if not more the difference in trade in value improv a sale and these two vehicles Tracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nI'm very good um I Am here I did buy your book here if I didn't like the whole program went down by it currently Iran I got you by asking you and then the code of money make up their\nFinancial piece book and the total panic over book okay\nAt ... am I Am having the guy that mhm and my income they're cutting out right now and I have\nI'm working like crazy I have heard a faint now thinking about Seventy I like the week I'm a ... car fare but yet I'm right now I ...

health crisis\nPie for aid and everything else you can imagine pumping everywhere paying everywhere criminals in the mix that's what people care about Trump's saying I'm shutting down the border I'm sending troops boom election right there that's what people give a damn about\nIf you're watching CNN to hear or see any and say\nYou know this is not Donald Trump's fault this man was clearly unstable and unstable\nPeople do unstable things and that's unfortunate now let's talk about public post that's never gonna happen stop trying to get people to agree with you who will never agree with you they do not come by their positions honestly\nAny group of people thought it was a good thing for me and see below sea to be the speaker of the house you can't reason with that group of people there in the party of Sheila Jackson Lee stop and think about that so many of you out there are letting these people ruin your life and you're not leaving your best\nLife you've got\nTo put these people behind you\nYou can't let these people drag you down enjoy your life they don't enjoy their last liberals are miserable they're absolutely miserable that's why they're so determined to make everybody else miserable because misery loves company\nAnd that's what they want they want to make you as miserable as they are that's all they have left it's all they have in their lives but you have family you have functional family relationships you're not a therapy for your inability to get along with everybody\nElse in your life they are you're not addicted to every drug to try to make reality go away because you hate it I mean these people are profile and you know this guy's a ...\nThe great example there are a lot of people in this country suffering from mental illness\nNot because there's too much fluoride in the water or our schools aren't any good there's a number of different reasons for it but what we do in this country is we've created outlets use too crazy people stayed crazy in their living room\nAnd they you know they have a family member call the cops all Tom cop show up domestic disturbance never threatened to kill their mom or their girlfriend or their next girlfriend or their neighbor and the cops go well\nSo what is it five Fifteen Maine oh that's so crazy ... yup crazy style end of the shift\nHey uh what what was the next shift need to know are we made three calls decided on ... main he's he's at a real rough night we we eventually took him in but just let you know they're going to bond him out he'll be back home by nine o'clock in the morning and I'm\nSure we'll be getting calls okay and that's what would happen you localized crazy but now crazy has new ways to be crazy they can get all these social media sites they can interact with each other they get so many more forms of input so many more triggers out\nThere and they go searching for crazy loves more crazy and that's what this guy did\nBut you cannot let this worry you and you cannot sit around worried that the national media is calling you a male bomber you know you're not and they're going to say that you are and we're going to have to leave it there you're going to have to move on in your life\nBecause you cannot sit around waiting on these people's approval you will never get their approval you understand me ever you will never get their approval\nMike in Chicago proceed\nSo there you go we're seeing massive numbers in Harris County and I think it's Republicans\nI think the cabin all thing was we was a necessary\n\nDemonstration of ... and who the left is an hour [noise]\nI think people needed to see that for themselves and they see it in their remind unfortunately\nIt's like with your kids you got to keep reminding them\nNo don't don't do that bad\nThing and they got to get burned every so often to be remind [noise] not to mess around with that\nAnd we lot of people needed to be reminded exactly who these people\nAre I don't know why I don't know why they have to keep being reminded but they do so just calm down nobody is changing their vote because of some dude in a van in in plantation Florida they're not it's not happening and nobody's indicting you\nFat we'd all be better off your turn CNN and MSNBC off I don't understand why all watch it all day long\nToo many of you walk to work you know what they're saying\nNo I'm not what what are what would I ever do that there's so many other more pleasant things to do\nI Know those ... cakes are over there I Know exactly what they're up to and you know what else I Know I Know there's gang bangers I don't need to go stand in the middle of 'em and worry about getting shot to know I don't like gang bangers\nI Know the caravan heading up here I don't need to go walk in the midst of all of them to know that this is probably not a good group of people I Know and then that yeah that's over there and leave that for what it is do we do our ... you know weird my spiritual believed they love when we\nMark go ahead mark in Oregon go ahead [laughter] good afternoon after Florida Yes sir ... in the last segment in the middle of one of your little round there you get something that was so profound and so true\nIt really did speak talked about you know these people don't come to their positions honestly\nYeah I did and that as I said I'd rather just so true\nYeah that's so true ah I I think it needs to be talked about that come to their position based on emotion and based on a predetermined the gender you over there than the struck they're not on us\nYou know what's interesting yes when lawyers are picking a jury they have a process called ward are and it's a process by which you asked\n... questions and then you get what are called strikes\nAnd in arriving at a jury of six or twelve people you um you you strike those who you don't think are likely to be ... to to ruin your way to vote your way [noise]\nSo if it's a case involving a police officer as a defendant and somebody is themselves a police officer or ... is himself a police officer or the wife of a police officer or the parent of a police officer you don't want them on their cars they're going to be sympathetic to the police officer\nIf somebody has ever been arrested and jailed you don't want that person because they have a negative view of police officers so I can already tell you that the lawyers\nThink that half of a person's mind has already made up before the case ever starch that's politics okay\nPeople that have a bad relationship with their parents are far more likely to end up on the left you end up on the left because authority figures structure figures everything their parents represent to them\nIs what they want to tear down and destroy\nSo they're not really arguing with you over the environment or Fifteen dollars an hour or socialism they're arguing with you as a way to vent and express themselves an act out over the fact that they don't like daddy\nDaddy makes them feel dumb daddy makes them feel are unsuccessful daddy makes them feel silly daddy reminds them of the time that\nThat they crash daddy's car daddy reminds them they went to rehab daddy reminds them of the time they took up with that absolutely awful human being who went off to jail daddy reminds them of the mistakes they made the money he's got they've called ... that they cost daddy\nAnd so they're mad at the world so they they pick up these other issues which become proxies for their own personal problems\nMost of what people were arguing about the politics are not the ... the issue that they're arguing about most of what people were arguing about is another issue\nWhen people want socialism what they're really doing is expressing their jealousy over the fact that they were a financial failure and they don't like that everyone else is that\nWhen people want that to happen when people want the redistribution what they're really saying is I'm not a producer I'm a loser and I don't like the people that are successful so I Want to deny that they're successful office\nOne of their own brown and their own brilliance because I'm really a lot of really dumb people really\nUnsuccessful people think they have the loser brand or they think that they're really smart\nAnd the world has wrong them that's why they're not so that's\nOf the world a better place every grown as men and lesbian woman\nThe top on the drive home you better go\nSee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMen\nIn this committee and many of them believe me because we are signed onto this letter to a demand and FBI and the Haitian really gets his perpetuating all these kinds of that action it's a man in this country and I just want to say to the men of this country\nJust shut up and step I Do the right thing and that's what\nYou see your race is used in the folks you have women and gays and Mexicans and most everyone else and you're not very smart you're not very pretty and you're not as good as they are\n'cause you're not as well as in light and as informed and progressive as they are\nYou're supposed to know your place and win Wolf Blitzer talks about you in flyover country he does
