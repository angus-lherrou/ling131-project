{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "A very random on average it'll make about one point two to one point seven percent rate of return horrible about like you're stupid savings account right\nAnd I'm In of course it's very front loaded the first three or four years all of the extra that you're paying instead of going to savings\nGoes to fees and so you get no cash value build up for the first one to three years something like that and um and then of course when you die the only thing they pay even though you paid extra create the savings account\nThe only thing they pay is the face value and so the money you paid in a savings account you'd lose so you have a savings account that has a bad right of return and when you die they keep your money that's just not a good plan um\nThe uh the universal life is the newer version of that um or the next newest version whole watch the oldest of the cash value plans the universal life was in an attempt to make it a little bit better and\nIt pays a I'm a better rate of return typically I'm most universal lie for average net of fees around four and a half to five percent right of return uh so it's more like an annuity ah and I was an insurance company more like a fixed annuity top of a product\nAnd then the the biggest downfall with universal not only that keep your money when you die but the other downfall is is the you pay one set amount per month\nAnd the insurance cost the amount that goes to insurance versus the amount that goes to saving the amount that's going to the insurance goes up every year as you get older\nSo that by the time you get really old with universal the amount you're paying may not even cover the insurance\nYou have zero going into savings and sometimes some of the money is coming out of the cash value to actually support the policy because you're not paying enough to pay their insurance premiums because the insurance costs ... universal goes up every year a but even with that it's slightly better\nThan whole life uh but both you know it's just one socks on one such worse you know that's all it is and then the next one up the next version that came out was called variable life\nAnd if you ever hear of that that's another version and basically what they did there is in the savings portion that put mutual funds in there and you can choose the mutual funds inside your very alive policy and you get a much better right of return\nNet of fees you'll make about seven percent usually on that\nBut the problem is a mutual funds were paying twelve to Fifteen and you're making seven which tells you what the fees are they charge a lot of fees on these things\nAnd so I'm sure there is just a fee everywhere every corner you call around where you're dealing with an insurance company\nSo the bottom line is with life insurance anytime you're saving money with life insurance companies you're going to get feed the death you're going to get a substandard right of return and an almost every case they're going to keep your money when you die\nAnd so that all makes it just a horrible place to\nPay money into a savings account that when you keep your mouth that they keep your money when you die\nAnd so that's why we recommend and always have recommended than I personally have always bought once I got my head screwed on and understood how the math work um I actually bought whole life one time from a rip off company called northwestern mutual\nBut I was in my twenties and I was stupid um do a lot of stupid stuff in my life so that's one of the stupid things so yeah unbelievable\nBut ah and they're like the most expensive one of the worst ones out there you know so horrible horrible products so we buy term life insurance which costs about five dollars a month instead of a hundred dollars a lot\nOr one twentieth for the same amount of insurance and I put my other Ninety five dollars anywhere else for investing I put it in a fruit jar and I come off better off than those guys and so I put any anywhere else and\nAnd so what you end up with is eighty percent of the people that sell life insurance for a living and that's all they sell or out of the business in one year\nYou have an eighty percent turnover in the whole life life insurance world and here's here's why the business model is basically this the a general agency hire someone in order to get to their friends and family and the new ... new insurance salesman is used to get to friends and family\nAnd then once you've worked through their market which called their natural market uh then their ability to sell insurance to strangers is all is just horrible it's it's never happens and so they very seldom may get once they run out of their list\nAnd so they ... their list they milk their relationships and then they turn over that's why there's such a high turnover rate and that's generally the business model now I Know guys that are northwestern mutual agents or Pacific Life agents or New York live agents that have been in the business for twenty five or Thirty years but they're the ones actually learned how to sell insurance\nAnd they don't and some of them are generally agents and they you know they hire people to work their list as what it amounts to knowing that they're probably not going to make it after they run through their list\nBut that's kind of how that business works and it's kind of an old model honestly it's pretty much dying a the ... whole life life insurance is kind of a Nineteen ... fifties sixties even seventies thing but by the eighties nineties and certainly up into the two thousands\nI mean no one tells you to buy cash value insurance anymore anywhere that is a credible financial mind except people to sell it\nThe only people that recommended or those salad\nYou just can't find anybody this an independent third party like me I don't know either one I don't care what you buy I endorsed sand or for term insurance was cause I Believe in term insurance and no I don't know Zander insurance ... insurance she's an advertiser\nBut a whole life couldn't buy an ad on this show for any amount of money we wouldn't sell it to him 'cause it's not good product\nJust like a payday lender couldn't buy ad on the show when my you know me endorsing at her a car leasing company couldn't buy an ad on the show because they're they're rip off products credit card you know when I got a day Ramsey credit card coming out I can just assure you that and they all kind of fall in that same category it's a rip off it's a bad product\nAnd do it and you know the reason is a bad product is not a moral judgments it's math\nJudgment the math is bad\nYou know when you borrow money at eight hundred percent interest\nOn a payday loan the math is bad\nWhen you ... when you save money in a whole life policy die and they keep your money your savings accounts that dumb the math is bad\nWhen you run out the cost to Capitol on the car fleece and you find out the average person who could have paid cash for a car but instead is policing the car their costs to Capitol translation their interest rate is up or to fourteen percent on a typical car place not someone with a one credit\nAnd so the math is bad so bad product\nThe Consumer Reports smart money magazine my calculator will tell you the most expensive weight on the cars to police it right and so the math is bad so if you sell those things and you know the math is bad that puts your morals and your ethics in jeopardy\nIf you don't know and you're just honestly stupid and you're just honestly stupid I've been honestly stupid time or two in my life been a long time I don't do that I certainly don't do it anymore but\nI mean I've done some not some things that I didn't know they were bad I Believe they were good and I'm telling everybody go no you know go borrow your mortgage I did that when I was Eighteen years old and my little stabilizes go get your your mortgage what else do the math is fat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoe sees she's not envious she's not pride full she's just kind and so I don't know what it's like to go through a divorce other than feeling like I've gone through a few with my friends over the years\nAnd it always seems that a person that was otherwise a nice person when they're going through a divorce you see the worst\nOf um [noise] you you see that the fangs come out in the clause go up well this woman who screaming is what I imagine every man out there kind of pictures for their ex wife\nShe's this shrieking heartbeat of a cat lady and she starts screaming about Kavanaugh having to take a polygraph she wants Kavanaugh to take a polygraph she screeching and screaming and just\nAnd if you haven't watched any of it yet then I'm envious of you go home tonight uh download it\nAnd you would just\nBe in charge four or five or six of these there's only one season so far in the new one is that the new and starts this week or no I'm Sorry it's it starts November second if\nYou enjoy music and you enjoy Iraq docks and you enjoy the history behind musicians you will enjoy this\nSo the\nThe over arching issue around the Kavanaugh's nomination yes it's a lifetime appointment\nBut there is a big issue of the fact that the midterms the voting is going to start and you know ... what are we thirty one thirty two were about thirty days from election day but we're just a few days from early voting\nI'm going to bag and I don't do that or else I'm going to bag our listeners\nEvery Texan out there to cast their vote on the first day of early voting and get your Ted Cruz vote in\nFor a number of reasons I'm not the least of which is to show the left you see the reason they've spent a fortune ...\nIs to send a message to Democrats across the country\nIf we can win Texas we can win anywhere of course the Democrats can win California their politics or lack of course the Democrats can win Oregon of course the Democrats can win New York\nAnd Vermont but if we can break that that red wall\nOf Texas then that means we can begin to take back\nThe new south we can take back those red states we can take back the states of the gun owning conservative rancher suburban night small business owner veteran these are areas they can't crack anymore their politics or to whack\n[noise] so if they could find a candidate a stealth Trojan Horse candidate to send in and they know they can mobilize the left\nThe sort of like West Virginia that ain't going to get you there you've got to be able to convince suburban moms what they called in two thousand what Al Gore and George W. Bush battled over which was the soccer mom\nThey were trying to convince the soccer mom the suburban soccer mom that ... was the guy\nAnd so that's why they had to humanize him you know he loves music he was in a band he said water burger he does air drumming he's just like you he's got a nickname and they needed to excite blacks and Hispanics and young people and that was the recipe and it looked good\nBecause they got a steady dose of earned media from across the country\nRolling Stone magazine took a break from making up UVA a rape case\nA articles which they had to settle for and wrote glowing stories about him the New York times wrote glowing stories the national magazine of Texas Texas Monthly which is very liberal but he's read across the state and and well respected they wrote glowing reviews on him\nThe newspapers the Houston Chronicle San atone expressed the Dallas Morning news day all wrote glowing reviews on and bought a great guy and they never talked about his policies because his policies would turn the voters off they didn't want to tell you he's a gun grabber\nThey they actually originally reported on him saying he would vote to impeach\nTrump he was the first member of Congress to come out and say he would vote to impeach Trump\nWell at the time he did it he had to mobilize the American left to get excited about the Senate race down in Texas\nAs we've gotten closer and closer to the vote he's embarrassed by that because now the Trump voters some of whom had problems with Ted Cruz because they ran against each other and they were still suffering with bearing the hatch it even though Ted Cruz dead and even though Donald Trump did a lot of those voters are now going wait a second\nI don't want the senator from my state leading the charge to impeach my president when he's doing a very good job so that's made people go I'm going to vote against that guy\nThen you've got the Soros money that's come into the state of Texas and that that has really offended people but then you've got this this cabinet case where you know people don't realize how bad it is to live under Democrat tyranny\nUntil they're reminded by having to do it\nYou forget how awful the Democrats are you forget how low morale was in the Obama presidency once he's gone\nBecause it's a coping technique you don't want to have to be negative all the time you don't want to have to have at the top of mind how angry you were at those people and how they treated you\nAnd it's not until you've gotta Kavanaugh case that you see that blurring idiot Blumenthal up there it's not until Feinstein is up there is not until Chuck Schumer is holding press conferences it's not until Durban is doing his thing\nAnd uh you know um\nThat sort of thing just reminds people that sort of thing simply reminds people\nYou know what I got to get out I Know Canada this perfect Ted Cruz is not perfect Donald Trump is not perfect Republicans have a tendency to do something that Democrats don't and that is eat our own we have a tendency to say if you are not perfect\nThen I'll stay home I'll vote for the other side or I'll stay home and that's why we lose elections we should when I've never seen Republicans this United\nWhen I'm In the news of more\nOn where the left went wrong they were never going to stop Kevin [noise]\n\nAnd their play their proper play looking back the most strategic thing they could have done\nWould have been to be very dignified but they don't have that in them and I don't just say that to insult them they don't have it in ... they're not they're not a classic group of people\nThey uh they they're play was to be dignified and hot so that we can stop Trump\nAnd that would have been the play that would have fired up their base now\nYou could argue and I think I I think there is some merit to this argument that by taking the fight to the Republicans by literally deciding\nYou represented a guy who'd been in Washington DC for over Thirty years he represented the establishment to Republicans and to Democrats and independents Obama looked like a guy who came from the outside and what's going to reform\nWell so when when you start putting together the groups that the banner under which people have mobilized in the last few elections going back to the Tea Party in two thousand ten [noise]\nI think what you're going to see is more even than\nMaybe with Trump although Trump did it well you're going to see the Tea Party establishment the swamp [noise] the ah\nCountry club ... every body will lie to vote [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nFour hundred and thirty five Congress\nWhen the news broke [noise]\nThat the office of a member of Congress [noise]\nMy dock sing releasing personal privilege information on senators and that's what ... [noise]\nUm for Sheila Jackson Lee when they told her her office had been engaged in docks and she thought that that was a weeny dog when you found\nOut that an office the staff of an office had\nBeen a a arrested\nYou might not have known you might not have worried whether it was your congressman but I can guarantee that the people in Houston\nThat that use donations every single one of them put their head and their hands and said dear God don't let it be Sheila\nBecause they're not just going to say Sheila Jackson leaves office they're going to say Sheila Jackson Lee open pairing capital the dash Houston close parents Sheila Jackson Lee Democrat Houston\nAnd what sticks out in that is the part that is attached to ever use stone in Houston\nA man the greatest city in America and this is what Americans are going to see if my city Sheila Jackson Lee and by God it was her staffer a twenty seven year old suppose it intern\n[noise] her newsletter that went out in May of this year lifted a the individual Jackson Cosco as a member of the staff it did not say he was an intern he previously worked for\nDianne Feinstein ... that's interesting he's an intern and he has by all accounts been in turning for quite some time or she says he's an answer and I think he's a staffer if he's an intern that would suggest he's not\nPaid if he's not in school he's not getting course credit if he's working without pay in a congressional offices that might well be illegal\nSo here's a congressman telling people how much they have to pay for minimum wage and she's not paying him at all\nIf she's not paying him how does he pay the rent which calls to mind the next layer of questions he's paying his rent so how is he is someone paying him\nIf someone is paying him to perform services for Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd that information is not being disclosed that is arguably a campaign contributions especially if he ever does anything related to the campaign which is easy to prove\nSo that would mean that someone is making a contribution to Sheila Jackson Lee without\nDisclosing it on the federally mandated under penalty of law\nDocuments that's a crime\nIf just the ... was prosecuted for that than you'd think that Sheila Jackson Lee if those things are true and I don't know that they are\nBut boy it sure does look fishy [noise] I think somebody needs to get to Mr Costco we need to find out first of all who pays his bell I mean he he it looks like he's going to be prosecuted for pretty nasty crime so he might get nervous\nI'm betting Sheila or somebody in her orbit has gotten to him already and said we're going to take care of you don't say a word", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Berry", "city": "Nashville", "day": "05"}
