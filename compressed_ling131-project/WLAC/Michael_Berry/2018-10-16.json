{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "And don't forget by the way we sold a house and that's the he's on Saturday at the smart conference\nThe everyday millionaires oh yeah every day millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and now you can do the book is on sale pre sale now it's based on the largest millionaire study ever conducted with ten thousand US millionaires surveyed the results will blow you away\nAnd if you want to learn and what this study says Chris Hogan number one best selling author ... personality has written this book it will be out in January if you pre order it for twenty dollars we're going to bribe you to pre order it\nFifty dollars worth of free items the everyday millionaires audio book and the everyday millionaires e book both sent with the book in January immediately you will get a lesson from Hogan\nCalled how to retire inspired and a video lesson for me as well called it's okay to be wealthy check all of this out of Chris Hogan three sixty dot com or Dave Ramsey dot com Scott's in San Francisco Hi Scott welcome to the ...\nThat that's what they're going to go sure what's up\nHey so I've got a question for you so my dad has a small [laughter] you\nKnow working with them for years and I just started a family on trying to take over the kind of make it better and everything was family either he wants to buy tractors you've got you started ... fan and he\nCan't get think that's the best way that the amount you know for taxes rather than\nSaving money never been able to hold over twenty five years and you've never been able to favorably\nMhm well that's why you know is because you keep spending money on debt to buy stuff that he doesn't even need to say on taxes are the the math that he's doing is unbelievably faulty\nOkay let me give me an example ... what would be a typical purchase it will be the size of the equipment I'm fifty thousand dollar item a hundred thousand right out while yeah fifty thousand\nDollars he buys a fifty thousand dollar item um in years past he had to he could not write that all off in one year we had to run it off over five years so it was a ten thousand dollar a year right off and if he has a ten thousand dollar you write off you don't get to say it doesn't seem to be ten thousand dollars on your tax bill\nOkay mhm instead what it does is it would save you about two thousand dollars on your tax bill\nNot what we're saying is that he borrowed fifty thousand dollars to save two thousand dollars a year on this tax bill for five years\nBefore yeah the the math is really really faulty there\nAnd so what happens is entrepreneur is either don't think this through an or use this as a rationalization to buy toys inside their business that they really can't afford ... she got to have to quit buying equipment until you can pay cash for it and then and then you're going to buy older used equipment only equipment you need to do\nThe job we don't buy anything here in our office if we don't have to have to get the job done when anything in the tax write off\nThe way he can he has to have because it has to be in because he said he doesn't want to break down but the one that won't be that break down and outfit and if you're just off the money that the way he ex wife and I\nTell them you're telling me all two year old and three year old tractors aren't safe and break down all the time\nAgain no asinine it's absolutely I ask them that that's just ridiculous\nOK student and here's the other thing is kind of a doctor Phil moment he's worked has bought off all these years and he has no money mhm and Dr phil would say how's that working for you\nYeah it's not you know so how's that theory of years working out here it's not working out and and so I don't know how to tell you to tell your dad what to do he's probably not listening to you and he's probably like I mean to me see the point\nNow finally I take it you know I\nKeep all you're running you know if you're running than if you're running it then you get to make the decision and you and I just decided you can ... I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment but I've got\nProbably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now what we're doing the show I Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need and then we make a decision whether we're going to buy\nNew and we certainly pay cash for it\nOr whether it's cameras are computer systems and in your case it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment\nUm couple pickup trucks to do delivery and stuff around here in one bus that keeps running us between buildings but other than that we don't have any big stuff like that but still I Can't have that bus breaking down all the time up that bus used\nDonald Harris drives our bus everyday runs us back and forth between our little shuttled between our things and it's it was a huge shuttle and paid attempt for it on a new one cost\nAnd it's run I mean it's broken down a couple of times when we rented a shuttle for that day when it broke down kept kept moving to put it in the shop and fixed it but I mean for that little bit of inconvenience it's safe\nAnd it's been reliable enough to get the job done and not shut us down\nAnd so that's a minor example but it's filling in the same metaphor and so yeah you can you can make this work\nBy used pay cash for your equipment otherwise all you do is work for nothing\nOh you do is end up with no money for all your work because and and the you know the heavy equipment dealer gets all your money and that just doesn't work for me I don't want to live that way Josh is in Savannah hey Josh welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave how you doing better than I deserve how can I help\nMy wife and I made from Alabama or Georgia almost a year ago and we have our tags for our cars are are coming up to be viewed in Alabama you pay for your car tag actually nearly then George you eat it at all in one one beginning and [noise]\nUm on one of our car could completely paid for so we're going to keep it there's nothing there's no way to be made there but we have um another car that we are about eleven thousand on that we've been comic letting sailing anyway [laughter] um we we recently started ...\nAnd um we've been kind of thing you know down anyway and we were uh our eggs that we have to bring your attack at the end of October which would be a lot more money than it would have been a cleaner than an Alabama\nHow how more on how much it costs to renew your tax\nAbout four hundred and ... what's your household income just under a thousand and one of the deaths of you've got not counting your house when you don't mind for me and my wife um wind for twenty nine thousand and one or twenty\nOkay and that's it yeah they're okay you like this car\n[noise] uh it's fine if not what we um we got as a family car we will we recently had a baby and it it it's not as much rain whenever we test drove it it's not my dream as we thought it would be once you got stroller you\nKnow if you want to move to a different car that's fine I don't think you have to do this financially and you're certainly not to do it over four hundred dollars for the tags um that's not the way you make the decision here but I'm basically you got a pile of debt you're trying to get through can you get through that in two years and keep\nThe scars yes I'm In his car the total of you're far less than half your on your own income yes and those are the guidelines we use on whether to keep a car so this car is very capable if you want to keep it if you want a salad and you can sell it at your car is not a problem thanks for the call that\nMost us our that Ramsey showing the bugs our thanks to James ... is our producer Daniel our associate producer and the phone screeners I Am Dave Ramsey your host and we'll be back before you know in in the meantime remember\nThere's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's the way\nTrue or you'll get sued and you could lose that's what happened to Rolling Stone and the University of Virginia but once you get the story once you can get one friend of yours to write the story and remember it's all about the cliques in in the world of it being all about the clinics the trick\nIs the trick with clicks is to be the first one to put the story out there because then drudge and everyone else will link to it even if it's not true witness the New Yorker story by Ronan Farrow\nJane Meyer remember they had they had a victim number two and that was missed Ramirez remember how quickly miss Ramirez exited stayed right almost as if she'd never even existed\nRemember she was the one at Yale and she was calling friends at Yale before she came forward and saying I'm not even sure if this is true or not but the I don't remember anything remember that remember she wasn't sure who had dropped trial but somebody dropped trout it\nMight've been Brett Kavanaugh on the reasons she knew that if somebody who wasn't in the room halfway down the hallway had screamed it out remember that well that is when you consider the anatomy of a smear that's how it works\nAll you do is you get somebody to report that it may possibly in some alternate universe be true and then everyone else piles on to that and says\nNew York times is reporting or Washington Post is reporting her some news station in Little Rock is reporting or some news station in Baton Rouge just reporting here's Nancy Pelosi explaining how this works\nBorn alive and wrong because the wrap up near my talk politics are hard to wrap up for re smear somebody\nWith false hurts and all the last\n... and then you write his report and the press that this is the last\nSeveral ... reporter for a lot of on the wrath of swarmed the merchandise\nTo passes report unfair that we mow all powerful\nSo that's what Feinstein did remember\nThat's what Feinstein did this happens a lot\nAnd you don't realize you're being played most of the time but what Feinstein did is she got the media to report on Christine forward\nAnd then she said oh my goodness\nWell yes yes it's it's true\nWe don't know if it was Feinstein who got the media to report it or if it was crazy Mazie Hirono there were several people involved during all of that time and ... when the post mortem is written on how the Democrats blue Kavanaugh\nIt's not just going to be the cabin all went on the Supreme Court because Kavanaugh was always supposed to be on the Supreme Court they never believed or they didn't believe before it that they had a chance to keep\nHim off they had to show their base that they were doing something to keep him off they built a little momentum they swung for the fences they pulled out all the stops me think of how many other cliches I could use\nFor um for the fences pulled out all the stops they left no stone unturned and they tried at all but in losing after\nHaving swung for the fences they didn't just lose the cabinet nomination they were going to do that before I submit we'll get into some of the the polling data here in a minute I submit that they lost the mid terms\nThey lost their chance to take the house they lost their chance to take the Senate they lost the Texas Senate race for fade out they lost it for ... Arizona [noise] but this is if I could get very interesting ...\n\nIn Florida he saw me when I Am on by hurricane and like\nOther states [noise]\nThat beautiful part of our country [noise]\nOf course\nThe media is beginning the drumbeat that the government's response has been insufficient you get a chance to hurt Rick Scott in Florida Republican governor\nYou get a chance to hurt Trump\nIn much the same way that the storm that came in just before the two thousand twelve election when when it looked like Romney was going to beat Obama\nObama's negatives were higher than any sitting president in the modern era running for reelection and it was believed that he couldn't win with those kinds of numbers\nBut just before the election and I'm not saying the storm was the only thing that did it just before the elections the storm came rolling through New Jersey\nWas hard hit and there was Chris Christie walking along the boardwalk with\nWith Morocco Obama arm in arm talking about what a great president he was and I think it helped Obama I don't know that that is what put him over the top but I think it helped Rick Scott\nNot you'll remember who Bruce or and his wife Nelly are Bruce or was the Justice Department official who was in contact with both Mr Simpson with fusion GPS\nThe uh opposition research company and Christopher Steele the British spy\nAnd Simpson who was working as a go between here it would appear paid Mr ... or worse the Justice Department will Mr or his wife Nelly was paid forty thousand dollars to help put together the CIA\nSo less review you've got a guy who works at the Justice Department was involved in the Hillary investigation and who's involved in trying to investigate Trump and they're spending all their effort on Trump and not Hillary even though they have a real case against celery\n[noise] so the guy at the Justice Department his wife's getting paid forty thousand dollars buy an opposition research from\nHis wife is getting paid forty thousand dollars buy an opposition research firm that's getting paid by Hillary Clinton and they receive some money from Morocco bomb\nSo it's almost as if Bruce for the Justice Department official might have a financial incentive to stop investigating Hillary\nAnd start investigating her opponent because he's getting paid by Hillary through his wife [noise] unless of course you believe that his wife has her own account and he has no idea that the family is being so enriched\nOr as congressional testimony has cast doubt on what Simpson told the house intelligence panel last November\nThere is some there was a school of thought that says or\nIf contradicting Glenn Simpson\nSuch that Mr ... Simpson could be brought up on perjury charges or testified on August twenty eight that he met Glenn Simpson twice in two thousand sixteen before the election and again after the election\nThe first meeting took place in August of sixteen after Glenn Simpson emailed\nOver or at\nThe Justice Department notes show that he took notes related to the Trump investigation during his encounter with Simpson so he's preparing his investigation into Trump using\nInformation with someone that his wife works with someone that's paying his wife\n[noise] there's one theory that Mr Simpson was paying Mr or his wife so that Mr over at the Justice Department would pay attention to what he was bringing before him\nBecause a private investigator that's good at digging up opposition research is useful but a private investigator who has a law enforcement official in his back pocket now he's worth his weight in gold\nSimpson testified however that he did not meet or until after the election\nWell that's a really relevant point\nDid Mr Sampson meet the official at the Justice Department Bruce or his wife works for Mr Sampson before and after the election or only after the election and if he did meet him before the election as Mr or says\nWhy would Mr or say they met if they didn't it doesn't help his case it actually hurts his case or is he afraid that they committed a crime and he's at least not going to get nailed for perjury\nIn which case was Mr Sampson not informed that the story is we didn't meet until after the election maybe they forgot to corroborate their testimony maybe one of them is telling an untruth and if one of them is telling an untruth\nWhy would they be doing that now before you think to yourself what maybe it just doesn't remember a meeting if they were weekly lunch partners and you forgot one of the meetings\nThat'd be fine\nBut if you've only met someone either two times her one time [noise] over this level of importance you're going to remember there's more coming our\n\nLet me just wrap up this issue because I Want to get to the president who I think had a very good weekend [noise]\nCongressman John Ratcliffe was a Republican is not surprised that Glenn Simpson is pleading the fifth\nDuring an interview with Fox News Ratcliffe says that ... testimony is at odds with the testimony that Bruce or with the department of justice gave last month quote\nThe reason for that is it Glen Simpson had previously testified under oath to the house intelligence committee\nThat he never met with Bruce or or discussed with Bruce or the Steele dossier prior to the October application that's the ... application in two thousand sixteen or the two thousand sixteen presidential election\n[noise] that is in direct contradiction to what Bruce or told me under oath last month I Am not surprised Mr Sampson is taking the fifth he probably should\nHe's in real legal jeopardy very clearly someone is not telling the truth Nelly or resource wife certainly can shed some light Nelly or of course works for fusion GPS\nSimpsons not the only one on the hot seat here deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein failed to appear before the house last week and Bob Goodlatte the terminal committee has threatened to subpoena him as well\nI Hope they stay on these cases like a dog on a bone because if these individuals even though they were not successful in swing the election if they did what I think they did if they did what I suspect they did\nThey committed high crimes\nThey committed crimes at such a level that they threaten our republic and I don't say that lightly they committed crimes that must be\nTo the full extent of the law\nAnd I hope they are let's get to the president on sixty minutes over the weekend I think he had a very good weekend and I think he's become very very good at this\nI'm going to play for you some clips of his interview with Leslie stall and I want you to see how on message he remains\nSome people when they get into a meeting like this Leslie stall is a very talented journalist she's very good\nShe will mix one part familiarity with another part respect and almost sort of a false I'm\nA false praise and then come back with a short of overbearing\nI don't want to use air quotes over the radio so I'm going to tell you where the quotes are that they put around his comments which would suggest that they were which with no not which would state that they were taking his words directly and that would be important\nThey wrote President Trump says quote Robert elite was a great general end quote during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader quote incredible in quote\nWell even liberals in the media came out in criticized what they had done\nEven liberals in the media came out in distance themselves from what NBC had done\nHere is the president's comments now I happen to think as many military historians do that Robert really was a very effective general\nAnd I think one of the factors in his favor on that subject is the fact that President Lincoln sought to employ him you know senior position within the union army fact he was invited to the ... to the White House so that the case could be made\nHe not break off and leave his fellow Virginian which he did this but that he lead the union ... he had a lineage at West point which was\nNothing short of spectacular um and in a union wanted his services and be the one to keep them away from the Confederate\nHe's been regarded throughout history by military who's historians as a very bright effective successful tactician\n[noise] now there's been in the last Twenty years in an attempt to discredit his military actor my ... and that's fine it's based in the fact that it's based in the sort of revisionist some of the confederacy was awful therefore anything that went on there\nDeveloped a cure for cancer in a Confederate a I'm a medical tent they would have declared that it was such a great I'm a discovery after all that it's it's that bad\nBut the point I'm making here is the militaries attempt to smear the president by taking words that I said military the media's attempt to smear the president by taking words out of context\nIt's backfiring over and over and over again because increasingly Americans don't believe them and increasingly they give Americans every reason not\nTo believe that here is the president's actual statement and I would I Would beg to find anyone who could disagree with anything he says here you're free to have your own opinions but there's certainly nothing he says here\nThat speaks to white supremacy or anything of of of the store and NBC you had to come to come back and do something they rarely do and correct their article and admit that what they said he said he didn't say here's what he did say\nOhio State that gave us a great president who has it been properly recognized OK William McKinley he has not been properly record the [noise] what he did in terms of phrase\nIn terms of war but in terms of trade and I hate to say it in terms of being smart and tariffs William McKinley has not been properly recognized but maybe someday he will [noise] it also\nGave you [noise] a general who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know what I'm Talking about [noise]\nSo Robert really was a great general [noise]\nAnd Abraham Lincoln develop a phobia he couldn't be Robert ...\nHe was going crazy I don't know if you do this or what Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln mom is that I Can't speak Robert Daly and they got all of these generals\nThey look great they were the top of the class at West point they were the greatest people\nThere's only one problem they didn't know how to held the when they didn't know how to fight [noise] they didn't know how and one day it was looking really bad and Lincoln just said you hardly knew his name\nAnd they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nThe Atlantic a liberal magazine credit to the Atlantic for putting together what some presidents\nHave said about Robert ... Franklin Roosevelt president about eighty years ago\nPraised and and as liberal liberal as you get praise Robert Daly as quote a nightly figure without reproach and without fear a figure who is like a night\nAnd the reason for that because Robert de lead was considered the body ... of the gym peel gentle respectful\nHonorable southerner FDR called him a nightly figure without reproach and without fear\nAnd he said that as he was unveiling a statue of generally in Dallas texas where he also called him one of our greatest American Christians and one of our greatest American gentleman\nOne of our greatest American Christians in one of our greatest American gentleman it was very important for Brock Obama to say that we are not a Christian nation\nWhatever we once were we are no longer a Christian nation\nThere was once a time when presidents would say that we are\nNot to say we are not welcoming to seek Hindu Muslim Jew Buddhist agnostic atheist rushed ferrying\nDwight David Eisenhower kept portraits of what he considered quote for great Americans on the oval office wall Ben Franklin George Washington Abraham Lincoln and Robert he ...\nHe told the United daughters of the confederacy that general Lee was quote a great and noble character and quote and general league quote remained always\nA pure soul another Democrat John F. Kennedy\nLooked upon leaves wartime service as a quote gallant\nFailure you did not win but he's sort of bravery\nLyndon Johnson another Democrat called Robert de league quote a great son of the south a great leader of the south as the man he stood as the symbol of valor end of duty\nI'm Sorry that's actually from Gerald Ford Gerald Ford said as a man who stood as the symbol of valor and the duty\nThat was in a bill that he signed restoring Robert he leaves US citizenship\nJimmy Carter a Democrat said Roberts Lee was a man who understood the values of a region which he represented\nHe called him a great leader Reagan called Robert de ... an American legend George W. Bush addressing the United states military academy called Robert de ... the perfect West Point graduate\nSo the media criticized as Donald Trump for saying that US Grant defeating Robert he was a major event because leave with such a good general and the media\nSays all that shouldn't do that\nWhen nothing less than West Point considers him to have been one of the finest and his father before him by the way\nThis isn't a confederacy issue this isn't a in an attempt to battle for the honor and dignity\nOf those who opposed\nWhat Lincoln's union represented this is simply another example\nOf trying to twist the words and actions of people in an attempt to swing an election to sway the opinions of people with dishonesty the\nSame network that used doctored photos of George Zimmerman's head when Trayvon Martin bang dam\nOn the floor on the on the asphalt\nIn an attempt to kill him and finally tsimerman in fear for his life but his head busted opening gushing blood had to pull the trigger\nNBC doctored those photos so that they didn't look like his head was split wide open because they wanted it to be the case that Zimmerman wanted killed Trayvon that he killed him without provocation so they actually doctored the photos\nWhen you reached the point that you can no longer report the news but that you actually all through the news in order to win your point\nHow can anyone trusts you after ... how can anyone ever trust you and so then the media is left\nConsidered on trustworthy their stories being called fake news [noise] nobody believing anything they say an angry at U. V. idiot who believes Trump and not them\nAnd yet they keep engaging in this nonsense and yet they keep thinking they can get away with this nonsense\nThey choose not to report on ... and their violence they choose to portray you or people in the Republican Party as violent mobs they won't let it be called a mob when Ted Cruz and his wife are run out of a restaurant where they're doing nothing more than trying to have dinner [noise]\nAnd I think it's going to cause them to lose [noise] think it's going to cause them to lose [noise]\nAnd I want to get to President Trump's interview on sixty minutes I think he was very very good coming out\nWay\nDean eighty or Zander insurance dot com pay Nashville it's day if you can now scratch the Dave Ramsey show on F ... I'm In my home town fall not new talk radio Ninety eight point three I'll\nWe say is it five pm on TALK radio Ninety eight forty three ten Fifteen ten W. L. A. C.
