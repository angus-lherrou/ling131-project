showed\nHey thanks nice to talk to your technical urban what's up oh so I'm Wondering if it would be okay to sell my condo um [laughter] that is completely paid for a huge part of the fun to do a career change and pay for school flash living expenses since I Will be working part time or going back to school\nYou're single or married ... years old married\nMhm okay and what does a career shift you want to do\nI'm so I'm a registered nurse and right now I'm In management um and I want to go back to school to be a nurse practitioner\nSure okay and how long will that take a going to be about three years and then once it cost a forty five thousand\nAnd then you sell the condo and you rent and you use the money from the condo to live on while you go to school and pay for school\nI was I was actually thinking about saving up for money and the next year to put down on a house and you're alone and um so you know buying buying a mortgage\nAnd how you're going to pay for a house ... if you're not working\nOr that we are hoping I could have a some saving for flesh some of the funds from the condo go toward um living expenses paying for school a cutter yeah you're not going to qualify Murray mortgage if you don't have an income\nI thought I was still working part time out that we make it about forty five thousand a year oh okay your wife work outside the home she told us and she makes what I'm about twenty five\nOkay and she argued ... are you going to be in the same city doing all of this\n... or\nI'm not concerned about homeownership until three years from now if you want to if you want to do this and just keep all the cash available and make sure you hit your goal that's fine let's make the turn with no debt and when we get out of the schooling land the you know nurse practitioners job and\nUh your income probably going to go up in that situation\nPretty substantially um then and you've done all of this for a hundred percent that free then you think about buying because whenever you buy in the next two years is not going to be a house you keep two years later\nOkay because you're going to move up and income your incomes going to go ... when you come out of school agreed\n[noise] yeah yeah\nAnd so it's a different house world than all of a sudden for you I don't mind if you rent\nSomething and just keep all your cash available to ensure that this dream occurs debt free because when I Dream of cars and its financial debt it often turns into a nightmare\nAnd we don't want to go that route but I Love the whole plan the idea and the will you know your willingness to sacrifice to get it done in research or life in your thirties that's that's pretty cool man a pretty gutsy and I like it a lot\nUm and obviously you've investigated ... nurse practitioner and what they do every day and that is what you want to do with your life and I'm\nSure it'll be heavily invested after this you're not going to be six months out of that and go I don't want someone you don't want to get to that that's you're paying too big a price to get there but if you're going to play this through for the next couple of decades this could be a very very cool move

when I'm ... and you can pick it up there a branch as a family member mentioned it might be a good idea\nTo freeze my one year olds credit do you think that's necessary\nI don't know that it's necessary but probably wouldn't do it\nI'm\nA I froze my kids when they were minors or ... the law came out allowing you to freeze in law just shifted the other day and in late ... in late September allowing you to freeze a credit bureau without any fees now like you were allowed to charge you a fee to freeze it or an freezing\nUp until a late September twenty first the law shifted so um yeah I Would freeze it and and the only reason is if someone were to steal his identity give your Social Security number somewhere and try to open an account of his name\nIs ... the company's trying they're trying to open the account with checks his credit they'll find it frozen and they would it would prevent that type of identity theft and out fraud\nUm now if they don't check it it won't prevent anything and only about three out of ten credit card application so they actually run the credit on the auto issue the other seven so that's how they issue credit cards on the people in dogs because they don't even bother\nTo check and if they check they'll discover you know a free you're a one year old with a frozen credit counseling Ogle fault while this was fraud and they're not going to issue the cars so it'll help you a little from and I probably would do it\nAnd I'm probably not probably I Would go to Sandra insurance when I get identity theft protection on your whole family including
