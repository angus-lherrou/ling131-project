{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Oh your your for your needs to be you know Mr Monday's great again and that's really what I Want to hear and I want to work for myself I just don't learn how to make the jump from\nLeaving my current job if I'm not excited about it all to going to the mall or their career is completely different field that has nothing to do with what I'm currently doing\nGotcha okay well let's talk about where you want to end up you want to eventually on your own business so let's let's identify that dream what is that\nI'm currently there's this kind of [noise]\nI Know it got to focus on one thing but I'm a ... of Harvard degree and work development and I have a passion for development Web design\nA great start companies and and just doing maintenance for companies [noise]\nUm but I also have a passion of a day Ramsey teach anything I've done the financial coach master courting and I would like to open up of practices you know maybe financial coach at home and saw it and I'm just completely different I'm not going to focus on one thing I just don't know\nExactly I should be focusing on right now and and I'm a reporter for somebody to give me that after\nNo well I think you have the answer I think you have any answer I'm going to put you on the spot okay\nSo I Know that you're passionate about Dave Ramsey needs help change your life and so you'd love to help others get some of that change that's what's really drawn you to that but I I I and I think that's fine I think you'd have multiple passions link passions could be on different levels and I think you could maybe do some coaching on the side for extra money\nBut I heard ... clearly and definitively say that you always love design and Web design and I think that that's the work that brings you great joy if I could snap my fingers and give you a job doing that right now how would you feel\nAll through right now to a fantastic of course I'm so\nBut here's the deal so there is a pathway to getting there what are you doing right now what is your job and how much you making\nA right now I Do a commercial laundry equipment refer her code laundromat dry cleaners\n... what do you think I'm a about sixty five thousand a year but I Do a lot of time working in and out of town you know that's really kind of what can they burn are now you've got to overcome All right do you have been out of town travel are what\nAre you completely out of debt what's your situation there\nAre out there and by yourself to we started with about Seventy thousand and right now we're down to about a Eighteen thousand then we started ... years ago that's awesome\nOr were where you've had two babies are ... we have a lot of medical expensive come up that we've been working for cash for it now but [noise]\nUh Josh aren't given up on the pie oh listen ...\nThat's incredible you're doing great what's your pay off day you've got an idea in mind if if life doesn't keep throwing some ... and everything stays the same when do you think you pay off that Eighteen thousand\nA bomb march march or April of next year and that's where ... ... oh\nOkay so here's what I Want you to see\nFirst things first your current job I Know you're ... you're working hard but it's making a huge difference and in less than a year from now you're going to be debt free and then after that you're going to put an emergency fun together and get through baby step three how long do you think that's going to take\nA less than a year probably eight month old for six months for ... murders in front of like a six month\nI agree with that Josh that's not that much time for you to bite your lip and be the study he wrote that you're being right now and get yourself set up to make this step not asleep but a step so my other question is let's focus on the future so how much experience do you have with Web design\nOh I have a lot from the past but I Do know with technology everything ... sorry we're way that I'm kind of out of it went on that as far as the the code and stuff but\nBut one good thing I have in my corner if I'm a very quick learner marketing I'm a film motivator started right and wrong learn learn the stuff that I could teach must shuttle um but as far as your knowledge I mean I've I've got a lot of knowledge\nAnd that's how I feel just a Josh here's the deal so you got some experience which is great so you're you know that you've got the skill set this isn't a skill issue this is a train issue so you're the number one homework assignment\nToday is to go find out what qualifications you're going to need for the marketplace to say I'd hire Josh to do Web design that's that's number one homework assignment what additional qualifications slashed training education do you need and I don't mean college because I just mean getting\nMore equipped and getting up to date to make yourself marketable\nFind out what that is that when you find out what that is the next question is how much is this going to cost me financially\nThen the next question is based on my budget based on getting out of debt and everything that's going on in my life if it's going to cost me this much much financially how long will it take for me to complete that qualification which will then make me qualified and marketable to do the role I Want to do\nJosh that's all you got to do because\nOnce you get the answers to those questions that's your plan\nYou understand you just plug in play at this point All right to continue this much I'm going to say this much money I take this class this course and then you begin to practice proximity and talk to people who were in the Web design space in Winston Salem North Carolina\nWho's hiring Web designers or this could be companies that hire internal people or maybe it's a marketing group a just a you begin to identify targets now this is all happening\nJosh while you're paying off debt and this current Kentucky\nFive thousand dollar over time gig is not going to burn you out any more 'cause you're going to change your attitude towards gratitude which is this job is the setting me up\nTo step easily\nAnd triumphantly into the role that I ultimately one field do you see where that is you see that about a year from now or it may be sooner if you get the qualifications sooner and you can get a Web design job that's going to pay you sixty five thousand or sixty thousand after you've paid off the debt it's\nA game changer all of a sudden Josh you waking up on Monday morning fired up and feeling so white you're not even sure if you're sitting in the car\n[laughter] that'd be fantastic but I mean you can see that can't you\nAre ten times as many as ... um were you saying that it makes me my my attitude change already and I'm I'm Glad I called you and I'm Glad you got a clarity that I later\nWell listen me and I'm Glad you called because I think there are millions of people they just heard your story and they see themselves in your story\nBecause you've you've got it figured out and and it's just\nComing up with a basic plan Dave Ramsey has been giving people a plan for twenty five plus years\nA folks there's five stages the ... and the dream one discovery who am I what do I want to do what I Want to do next research you just heard me walk Josh through research what I Need to learn to be able to do what I Want to do then after I figure out the research what I Need to know who I Need to know\nUh when I Need to learn who I Need to know then we're going to move into\nActually embarking stepping out in making something happened practice that proximity press will get around people they're doing what you want to do get in places where what you want to do is happening that's the embarking you're just start knocking off those mini milestones in those goals\nYou're going to begin to achieve and as you achieve\nYour ... going to step into that dream roll the role that you were created to fill the world needs you to perform that's the final stage of realizing the dream that's\nMeaning waking up like Josh wants to wake up he's dreading Monday morning how many have you dread Monday Mornings there'll be a shame that Seventy percent of Americans no longer [noise]\nThrilled to sit in for Dave Ramsey want to thank you for allowing me to do this career seem our Web thank our producer James trials in our associate producer Kelly Daniel but mostly you find them thank you so much for listen this is that they ran for sure [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nTaliban apparently ... ah some under pagan rituals she's a bit of a nut but the Democrats will still vote for never the last Republican over Democrat as a party preference in that race\nAt forty four thirty three according to the pole as reported by NBC News not exactly a conservative outlet\nFlorida at forty four thirty eight\nIn the midst of a very very tough race race there between the scientists\nAnd Gillum Gillum is nothing short of a nut himself but the scientist doesn't seem to be able to put any distance in between him I think President Trump will probably swoop in a time or two more between now and election day\nIn Georgia Republicans up fifty two forty three the governor's race there\nWould appear to be closer than that but I'm hopeful Republicans can win that one as well in the state of Arizona the sorry state of Indiana where Joe Donnelly\nI think it's going to be punished for his role in the Kavanaugh hearings Republicans at fifty one percent Democrats trailing\nBy about five percentage points there Montana forty eight percent Republican to twenty nine percent Democrat Tennessee Republicans at sixty three percent Democrats at thirty\nAnd Marsha Blackburn would appear to have started putting some distance in between herself and the Democrat challenger\nState of Texas pure party preference fifty three percent to forty three percent newest round of polls has cruise beginning to widen his lead over ... and his yard signs\nTroubling for Republicans would be the state of Nevada which are showing thirty eight percent Republican to forty five percent Democrat the Democrat Democrat gubernatorial candidate they're having some problems with an axe accusing him\nOf violence\nBut all in all are Republicans appear to be doing pretty darn well for themselves across the country even in some congressional races in California where you would least expected Republican has pulled ahead of Joe mansion in West Virginia in polls polls don't vote remember that\nBut you'd rather be ahead than behind Wisconsin where the president had a rally yesterday would appear to be a highly winnable Senate seat over an income but Tammy Baldwin\nIn North Dakota the Republican has extended the lead sixteen percentage point lead in the polls over Heidi Heitkamp whose latest round of problems include that she published a full page ad of suppose it's sexual assault victims\nAnd those sexual assault victims did not give her approval to do so and called her out on it it got so bad I Can't follow it up her full page ad exposing those women with a quarter page ad apologizing ... that's like how the a\nCorrection to an erroneous story appears on page eight where the erroneous story was on page one\nRemote who was it again who said\nA lot can get halfway around the world before the truth can get his pants half pulled up or\nGet his pants pulled up it sank Crispin stay [noise] will be ending the show with a little kind of ran out special treat today [noise]\nMichael very she'll use\n... or ... ... from ... from my cup ... over for a time\nEarly vote him over and over I think of all of a hangover harmful\nWere given a crowd kind of like ... ... members [noise]\nHorrible proper harm [noise] I Know you see\nLeaves has been married\nSeems I hear your own boss calling\n... and that\nSaying that\nTaxing kept passing through\n\nSeems they are saying the brain and\n\n... and\nJohn ... coming out and saying that Americans should be kinder to the caravan headed here I don't know why John Casey has not been quoted about the\nMail the use of the United states post which they used in some of these cases 'cause his dad was a mailman never forget that Ethiopia has elected their first female president\nIt never happened before [noise]\nUh [noise]\nSociete press reports defense secretary Jim Mattis\nMad dog Mattis is expected to sign an order to send at least eight hundred troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs the caravan ... toward the United states and that gets more\nAnd more interesting [noise] I watched various network's coverage of\nThe bomb quote unquote issue today [noise] something something struck me as odd\nMayor Bill de Blasio in New York was speaking with several of the\n\nExperts on bombs they're his security apparatus\nFox turned on camera prior to the press conference and you're watching reporters in different security folks ... ahead of time and then the Blasio and several of his top aides or top security experts walk in and it's\nAbout a minute before the press conferences going to go live\nAnd they're all ... it up\nI remember after nine eleven I remember after terror attacks I remember after news of shootings\nIn Las Vegas San Bernardino school shootings\nThe law enforcement officials stand in a very somber fashion because parents whose matter and watching them before the press conferences began the very serious straightforward look\nThere was never ... it up it is almost as if if you were studying the body language and I don't want to make too much of this it is almost as if they're not taking this seriously\nI think they would take it seriously if they believed it was a serious threat but one of the things more and more experts are beginning to say is that this effort appears to be so amateurish\nSo ridiculously absurd\nSeveral experts I've seen and my own common sense tells me that if you were actually trying to harm someone\nJust would not be the way to go about it this almost appears to be a spoof on terror threats or it's almost as if this is evidence being planted to incite\nThe stories but to make sure that nobody ever actually gets harmed because someone either lacks the expertise or the desire to injure anyone\n[noise] I Hope no one ever gets harmed but\nIncreasingly I think a lot of people were starting to ask the question is real\nMichael berry CEO continues on for ... for ... your home about I'm pregnant with Karl Rove who can vote on off and go\nOn to my home phone were farm about provide fodder for most of them\nWere from a guy my car reporter for less than\nWhat it sounded impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text proud to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P R O U D [noise]\n\n\n\n\nBackground pictures of the NBC News ...\nIs a bridge spanning river in Guatemala and the bridge is chock full of the caravan I mean there's not room\nTo lift your elbows turn around it is\nNot sure why they chose to use that as their background picture maybe they're sponsoring the event unclear Jay in Galveston Europe very I enjoy\nIt for our own and want to say about it I think\nThat a John Lennon that are very ... wherever you with us author and it got into this I got to be out of eight by a truck and that man ... no wonder that man was going to be home\n[laughter] if I felt I got here [laughter] yeah or if they don't follow held him over to is that is that the prices they cast\nYour Democrat voted off the air they knew that that ban would drop out at ... ... yeah they do yeah and then I'm not a very well on I just had a ...\nI was told that you voted straight Democrat today is that why you voted straight Democrat today\nOh yeah we got to check that wherever I go to guy he's he's he's alone at Philly you voted you were saying you voted for state\nA state representatives and state senators injustices of the pie devoted to carry it on the basis of\n... LA so you're if you're offended that I saw it as you're not as it was all you rather than an off like I said this is where we are regarded everybody know okay you know with no okay so you're talking about him last year but yeah\nYou're right it is a bandwagon the man of retarded\nNow is that if we have a saying dollars and ... not what they don't get the money for oh probably helped me all day I got it we're not the barber shop you talk now let me ask you a question\nI'm not going through that discussion again but uh if you've got that thing you do when he turns cold\nYou can start eating Chile or\nYou make a certain soup or you go to certain restaurants for certain soup or hot cocoa or whatever it is\nThat you do or you might enjoy that discussion\nIt's posted to the pod cast as all of our shows are about Fifteen twenty minutes after\nWe go off the air so our eight to eleven AM program this morning is posted to the podcast if when we're through this evening you'd\nLike to listen to that again that's at Michael berry\nDot com it's free and its commercial free Darryl\nIncome rose Europe [noise] Michael\nIn regards to this illegal um alien invasion coming up from Honduras and Mexico ... there's a very effective way with regard to the Mexican government\nAnd it doesn't involve us falling into the trap a bad optics of you know truth so much to us troops so much as breathing on an illegal immigrant that the mainstream media is you know already cutting their cameras up for\nThe first one is the first idea if the international watering boundary commission we kick the Mexican government off of it take control of the Rio Grande and threatened to cut off or water\nIt won't cut it won't cause any immediate harm because it's so wet right now but all those citrus growers on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande will start getting real darn nervous\nThe second idea is a ... which is the\nMexico not in the Mexican national oil company\nI think it's now the other treatments I some X but yeah yeah but\nOkay they own a fifty percent stake in that show refinery on the order you [noise]\nAnd they bring my in heavy crude\nUp there have you ever find and then show so I'm got yeah refined products\nSo why don't we seize that refined products and put it in the gap right of all these vehicles and find what not it's going to be used to provide services and deal with their citizens\nDarryl while I appreciate your frustration with the caravan and the seeming unwillingness of our neighbors to the south to handle their own responsibility\nI Am not in favor of seizing assets of foreign or domestic interests that will have a chilling effect\nOn the investment that comes into this country that is at the core of our wealth creation we don't want to get into the business of government seizing assets willy nilly and why are we going to seize assets\nOf financial interests over five to ten thousand migrants on march we find ourselves seizing assets quite a bit in fact I'm with Rand Paul on the issue that we need to stop seizing so many things we\nConfiscate people's money we we take their funds on the basis that they're supposedly in drug deals are in the cartel or a terrorist or whatever else they're all sorts of Americans innocently having their cash seized\nAt airports or various checkpoints throughout this country that they never get back so no I won't be for that this is not very difficult for every one of you who has been a parent or who wants had one\nYou've probably use the following line you can do what you want when you're out on your own but as long as you're living under my roof and I'm paying your bills then you're not going to fill in the blank\nSo very simple concept every parent is used it and every one of us as a young person hurt our parents tell us that you don't get to do what you want to do as long as the parent is paying the bills and you're living under the that roof\n[noise] Trump very cleverly said the Guatemalans if you don't stop these Hondurans from coming up here and we're going to simply freeze the one point six billion dollars you receive that's not so difficult you could do that to Mexico you could do that to Guatemala you could do it to Honduras\nThis is not a problem that should require the United states military now I may eventually because the crap rolls downhill\nThis is not a problem that we should have to be calling in to talk radio with clever ways to deal with it should not require minutemen national\nGuard troops military troops are the seizure of assets\nIt's a problem that other governments need to solve and if they can't solve it we should use our diplomatic ties there's a reason we have embassies there's a reason we spend so much on the state department there is a region reason we expend so many\nHe and his own way a really does do a lot to promote violence now they're trying to turn a at their lawyers\nYou know she uses the word basically when she's nervous as a verbal tick listened carefully\nBuilding up on people and taking them out on a stretcher and even said\nA ... they're lawyers' fees to get them out just the other day he was one thing and I'm basically a appreciating\nHeard that\nNow listen to her during a congressional hearing when she realized in the middle she probably said something she shouldn't have\nThat's what this never would be all about the liberal will be all about socializing or um [noise]\nTaking over ...\nShe says basically you but you're ready something was about to come out of her ... how did you ought to be listening at do you hear me\nMichael ... who has endorsed ... has come under fire for saying that no matter what in twenty twenty the Democrats need to make sure that they nominate a white male\nHe's now been hit with almost five million dollars in a judgment to pay his former law partner he's been evicted from his office for not paying his rent and he's\nBeen referred by Congress for criminal prosecution for obstruction of justice you gotta wonder what his ads are going to sound like now [noise]\nDo you have mentally unstable friends or relatives you'd like to exploit [noise]\nI'm attorney Michael ...\nYou may see me on CNN discussing our president sex life for over a decade ago [laughter]\nThat's kinda my thing but it's not my only thing I Would I'm not making the rounds on cable news stations I'm busy exploiting people's insecurities for my own financial gain hadn't you can do what if you owe a small fortune to the IRS or ... dollars in unpaid yet [laughter]\nBig deal this year alone I made a small fortune by convincing people on fundraising forbade it won't work when in fact\nI'm not you can trick stupid people into donating money to use simply by telling them you dislike the people that status like contact my law office now and I was thinking about earning millions of dollars by making empty promises and not repaying people you previously did business with that that's my collaborator\n... way [laughter] so what are you waiting for the call my office today and I'll show you how to get rich and famous while simultaneously doing nothing and standing for nothing morning

[noise]\nMeanwhile the media stuck a camera and microphone in the face of one of the migrants\nPart of the caravan Corrine toward the United states and they asked the question you think there are some criminals in this crowd\nOf those everywhere [noise]\nIt's criminal say here I mean it is [noise]\nCriminals in the crowd what kind of criminals how bad are they\nWhat are they sending us is this like when the boatlift when Castro unloaded the prisons we don't know who these people are they're\nCriminals in their midst even one of them says so [noise] so the Daily Caller sock comment from ... work
