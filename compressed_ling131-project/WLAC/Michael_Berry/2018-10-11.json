Sally the Republican there something of a bad assed\nVeteran from what I understand has erased\nAll of cure students to name as early lead in the race to replace Jeff Flake now this is not McCain's seat this is Jeff lakes seat remember the governor there put the former Republican senator in that seat for now\nFlake fortunately is retiring flake voted against Kavanaugh I'll remind you mix Sally is now up she was ... she was losing\nShe's now a forty seven forty one and the Green Party candidate angel agree that's convenient has four percent\nWhat's interesting there is I think a couple of things happening that's a Republican state there's no doubt Arizona's a Republican state\nHas been since long before Goldwater consistently\nYou have some pockets of Democrats you had a Hispanic Democrat who was plum crazy you had Gabby Giffords who was a Democrat in a purple district but at the time\nShe was a pro gun rights Democrat and she was a little more conservative on some of the social issues and so she was able as a Democrat popular Democrat to win in what was really a Republican district and I believe it is Republican now\nSo but the state is a Republican state no doubt about that much Sally was in an ugly ugly three person primary race and I think there were some hard feelings there\nI think that some of what we experienced\nIn for instance Alabama where you had kind of a Tea Party candidate kind of a constitutional is Canada national a nationalist nationalist populist candidate\nAnd then you get more sort of a traditional Republican Party establishment guy you get these bruising primaries and we're not done with this this has been going on with we've really seen is a lot going back all the way the two thousand ten\nIn Republican primaries and the question is can you get\nCan you get your folks to come back out in November behind the candidate who beat your candidate in the primary\nAnd it might not be that they vote for the other side they just don't vote for the person who beat their candidate in the primary that's where these bruising primaries are so tough there so so tough\nWe saw that in Alabama Doug Jones should've never won 'em up and Roy Moore had his problems as as a candidate and you you you drove a lot of people away and then by the end Roy Moore was the guy that a lot of Republicans didn't want in their Martha ... not that kind of Republican\n\nThe Democrats would suffer I mean look at look at what um Nader did to Al Gore but for Ralph Nader running in two thousand Al Gore would have one that we wouldn't have ... you wouldn't have known to the secretary of state was in Florida there would have been no hanging chads that races over\nLet's turn to Tennessee my my prediction at this point unless something dramatic changes my prediction at this point is\nThat Arizona goes to Martha McSally that a Republican holes that seat which would be important\nThe national folks are are are weighing in and helping where they can mix Sally plays nice with the establishment so she's not a candidate that the establishment is going to turn on\nKicker out of the boat so my guess is they pour some resources in their toward the end they really focus on her military record which is impressive um they focus on keeping that seat Republican\nAnd she's a woman if it were if she were a man that she could be hit by a woman as you know we need another woman in the Senate but she's not\nSo if if I were to say right now I think Arizona holes that seat Republican Tennessee has been an interesting see\nAll of this Marsha Blackburn the congressman appears to have pulled out in front I don't\nHow you pronounce this guy's name breeds and I see it written but I don't I don't know how you breathe isn't or breeds and B. R. E. D. E. S. E. him it doesn't matter\nBecause Martha Marsha Blackburn is going to win that\nRight now a Fox News or let's say a New York times had a live poll the New York times is doing this deal where they're calling people and as the calls come in they're posting them which is an interesting kind of a real time it's almost like when Frank Luntz does the\nThe ah the the surveys where they have you know six or eight or ten or twenty people and and they have the meters\nAnd as they vote you get to see you know like you get to watch them watch debate and see what they like and don't why well this thing's pretty neat what what New York times is doing I just don't trust the New York times but they've got um\nThey've got Blackburn with a ... point lead\nUm\nThey've got her with a with a sorry an Eighteen percentage point lead fifty seven thirty nine Tennessee is a red state it's a Republican state this is Bob Corker seat\nTennessee has been cursed with to squish\nRepublicans Corcoran Lamar Alexander\nAnd I think Tennessee is a more conservative state than the senators they've had they've had Jeff Flake style senators and I think the state is much more conservative than that I just do\nOnce you get outside of Nashville I don't think Nashville itself is is terribly conservative as most big cities are and it's a big city full of artists so I think you've got a bunch of\nYou got a bunch of granola conservative types skinny jeans wearing a liberal folks who liked to act like their country but there are actually Austin, Texas or San Francisco liberals anyway I think Marsha Blackburn wins that the national media\nHas fallen for the issue that that uh\nTaylor Swift has broken her silence on politics and she's done what the mob demanded she's gone with a Democrat interestingly a Democrat who in two thousand five had some serious sexual harassment allegations in his office\nAnd she did this just after the Kavanaugh hearings so that that's\nKind of an odd choice and by the way the guy she went for said he would have voted yes for Kavanaugh\nBecause he sees riding on the wall he's looking at the same polling number we are except he's looking at a lot more polling numbers\nRemember these guys have a lot more polling data up to date sooner than you do so by the time you see a poll that says hey Heidi Heitkamp losing in North Carolina I mean in in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat incumbent is losing in North Dakota\nAnd the people of North Dakota want Kavanaugh by the time you see it she's had it for days she's had time to change her opinion or change our public positions\nNever forget how much polling data these people have access to in real time\nThey pay people a lot of money to do focus groups and see where they should come down on these issues and they don't make a statement on it before that and I'll tell you this I'm Glad Susan Collins went with with a Kevin all\nBut I guarantee you Susan Collins was looking at polling data that showed that the people in her state wanted Kavanaugh\nThat doesn't minimize how difficult it was for her as a woman to come out in favor of him especially when she was targeted so heavily but it\nMean that the support is there\nThat tends to have more than just say All right we were doing Seventy five now will do Seventy it tends to have a reverse ripple effect\nFor all the confidence so much of our economy is built on the confidence of if it's at ten bucks today it will be Fifteen tomorrow in twenty the next\n... now the fears start creeping in and then people start acting on those fears they start selling what they have as they sell and dump that means that the price starts coming back now\nAnd our economy is in order to understand our economy you have to watch it in terms of trends\nNow instead of seeing that steady consistent price increase you see a price decrease and with the the falling market today you see that or you'll see that some people are going to get scared they're going to dump\nThey're going to get rid of it ... the end is coming there's been a lot of ... ... a\nRon Paul said earlier in the week and he was saying late last week that we're due for\nLetting some air out of this economy it's it's overheated right now and I'm ... I think what you're watching is a lot of folks acting on the fears that we've had a lot of growth consistently over a period of time\nI don't like to see this right before an election\nBecause it makes people think\nThings are going wrong when they're not necessarily\nI don't like the term market correction and a lot of people don't because that suggest that there is a point at which we're supposed to be\nAnd if we get above that you have to come back to that so I don't use the term market correction because I don't think it's necessarily accurate you would have to know what the proper market level is to say that this is a correction rather than simply\nA decrease but I Will say I'm President Trump's administration has ushered in incredible wealth accumulation and no not just for rich people it has ushered in incredible wealth creation\nFor working class people for entrepreneurs for a lot of Americans across the board and you would think if people were voting they're back pocket which in Nineteen Ninety to\nJames carnivals message for Bill Clinton supporters are for for middle Americans\nWas it's the economy stupid wasn't the worst economy but they convince people that was now how how in the world was he going to fix the economy what exactly was he going to do to make the economy any better for anyone else\nHe talked about the fact that people weren't making 'em up enough at their job the president doesn't effect that\nThe president the best thing the president can do is get out of the process\nAnd let companies succeed and then they'll have more money as they have more money they'll recruit people from companies to come to work for them and they recruit one guy away\nThe next guy gets recruited by the company that the job that he opens and that that creates an increase in wages [noise] but [noise] we shall see Trump should be a lot more popular than he is given this economy [laughter]\nAnd Michael berries yogurt use [noise] about Lacey [noise]\n\nThe side of the last election I got out here [noise]\nI'm really excited [noise] I'm really excited because\nAfter the last\nElection the Democrats spent that first year they spent that first year\nReally pushing the narrative they were gonna put Donald Trump in jail not just drive him from office put them in jail and well how how far we've from Russia collusion right about now\nI'm going to admit it sit and where you're sitting\nAdmit that a year and a half ago you wondered if you're you're you're you're of a Trump voter and you wonder if maybe just maybe already I mean they they got the FBI\nDown and take the ... to get the get well what do they have what do they have where is what they have\n[noise] the problem is [noise]\nJust like in South Texas or in Chicago there are going to be boxes that are going to come in late and it's going to be casino employees that's what you're up against you're up against the corrupt machine that plays for keeps\nIn that worries me but if if Republicans can hold Arizona Nevada Tennessee in Texas they keep the majority you you can you can write off the other races\nUm\n... you know you've got some other opportunities to increase your majority and here's what you offset potential losses I Can't tell you right now that Republicans are going to win Arizona Nevada Tennessee in Texas\nI Can't say we went off all for I think we're going to win Texas pretty sure that and Tennessee and Arizona look better than ever Nevada's a toss up\nBut then you've got North Dakota where right now the challenger is leading Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat so that could be a Republican pick up that way if you lose Nevada balances\nYou got Indiana with donnelley I think Donnelly will probably still hold on\n[noise] you've got Montana with tester the fact that Republicans can't win Montana just blows my mind\nYou've got West Virginia with mansion the problem is that mansion voted for Kavanaugh and I think that's going to tell Republicans their cars mansion is personally popular\nHe might be a Democrat but he's personally popular and I think there is some folks that are going to say well\nYou know\nIt doesn't hurt us to have a Democrat and when we really need him is with us and that\nDrives me crazy but anyway you've got Florida where Bill Nelson\nI mean we're going to see it you know what happens with this storm a hurricane Michael this just hit those sorts of things happening right as an election occur always scares me\nBecause the media loves to blame Republicans for storms they just do\nStorms can affect politics dramatically our mind you what happened in two thousand twelve where Chris Christie was walk and a half naked on the beach holding hands with Morocco Obama in announcing that block Obama was the best president ever\nAnd that because the Iraq Obama New Jersey was going to be great and basically endorsing Barack Obama and given Obama a boost in the days just before the election\nAnd I'm not being too hard on Chris Christie because the Romney campaign had had problems with Chris Christie the entirety of that campaign including the fact that Chris Christie was still threatening to run until the very last minute because he's an eagle maniac\nAnd Chris Christie may nice with Iraq Obama and you'll remember the story Obama was on a plane with Bruce Springsteen and they're making fun of Chris Christie and Obama talks Bruce Springsteen into calling Chris Christie\nAnd talk and nice to him for being so nice to Obama so Chris Christie really handed up after that and later they made him the butt of the joke\nBecause they both think he's a ... as I Do but the storm scare me and Florida is a state that Republicans really need to win and when when Baquet Democrat seat course Marco Rubio's the other senator there\nAnd then the last seat is McCaskill in Missouri which we should have won with Todd Akin six years ago but Karl Rove decided he didn't want to win that seat if Republicans win Missouri over McCaskill that makes a potential loss in say Nevada\nThat that's a balance you got four states where Republicans are in trouble\nOr four states where Republicans are being challenged I think Ted Cruz's pulling ahead so you take that went off the table I think that that Marsha Blackburn a pulling ahead so you can take that went off the table in ah Tennessee I think like Sally\nHas enough of a lead so you can take that often in Nevada is a problem so that means Republicans just need to win at least one\nOf North Dakota Indiana Montana West Virginia Florida, Missouri I like to change [noise]\nThe Michael Bay ratio continues\nHow\n\nOff ... screaming come\nAbout\nCouple of emails came in during the break [noise] said I didn't share any polling numbers in\nMontana and Missouri\nI'm Out kind of try to synthesize Missouri is a dead heat um the\nThe nominee the Republican nominee there's the attorney general Josh Hawley\nEvery poll I've seen has had him barely up or tied except for one from CNN that has McCaskill in the lead I Would say that that race is probably right now a dead heat\n[noise] this is the year of women it just is\nA that's not some empowerment thing if that was a woman running against McCaskill\nI'd give her a bit of an edge the fact that McCaskill is a woman Democrat running against Republican that's the only thing the Democrats have going for them right now\nThat's that's their story lab they always have a storyline Republicans are racist Republicans are public comes hate or Mexicans Republicans eight Hispanics Republicans have gays Republicans hate the environment\nThey're going to pound because he got so many races\nThat are woman on woman they're going to town on the woman card\nAnd then only\nWomen Democrats stand up for women will see how it holds up\nA but that's that's that's\nThe strategy going into the final stretch here\nIf I had to say I'd say that McCaskill probably holds on and wins in Missouri she's a good campaigner she's the incumbent there's a benefit to incumbency but I'd really like to see her beating that say Republican seat that's a seat the Republicans\nShould hold on to that is a seat at ... you had what was it a four day in fourth and Ashcroft\nYou had to rock solid Republicans in in representing Missouri in the Senate for a long time nationally influential Republican senators that as a state that should have Republican center that's just what that state is not St Louis\nSt Louis is that the asylum but the rest of the state it's again there are how many states do we see where this happens\nOregon
