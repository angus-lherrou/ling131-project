Ninety six people were approved so I mean that's those are the odds you want you know I Want I Want to wait ten years only to find out that the government scam me basically\nSo I'm not I think you just work like a crazy man pick up as many hours as you can pick up the great news is you're nursing I mean it's just a wonderful career paths\nBecause you can add hours or add you know pick up some he our time or whatever you need to do I don't know on the short term when you make sixty thousand dollars extra money so fast disarm blue like in two years you could just make sixty thousand

stuff All right Tim is a one of those in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\nDave how're you doing better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nOh well I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five and my car is about to go but I'm trying to office shave and pay off this debt as quick as possible joined question is is right now I'm putting\nSeven percent of my paycheck into my four one K. shed doing all that down to about one to two percent and just started throwing money at this loan right now I'm doing about a hundred dollars a week at it mhm just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but I was your opinion should also thank you for so much\nI you know you've got to videos and lifting your show you've helped me avoid a lot\nOf bad decisions like buying\nA crappy house and going into like a twenty thousand dollar Carlo show I really appreciate that\nCool good so well thank you um what do you make what's your income\n[noise] I Do about twenty three thousand dollars after taxes but that's not including the overtime I guess\nYou know what are you there um Wilder okay should get a lot over time off for the most part and you get more Oh absolutely no ...\nFor a ... you could really load up your overtime and clean up the ... very very quickly and save up and get you know the Fisher College of emergency fund and then save up and move up in car and cash\nThat would be my last year I Do know that would be my first three goals with what uh her than than an only than what I restart\nMy four oh one K. so what I'm saying is temporarily not forever but maybe for a year or maybe even two you're completely stop your ... to become completely debt free build your emergency fund is three to six months of expenses and then\nOnce you've done that to save up and pay cash for a car and that's I reached at three in the rebate and then you move to babysit for and restart their four O. one K. and then you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement but at that point you don't have any payments and you're driving a paid for decent car\nAnd these are all a really good place for you to be and that that's the direction I Would tell you to move towards show yeah while we have people working these baby steps Tim unless your own baby step forward telling you to temporarily\nTemporarily temporarily stop your four one K. investing Andrew is with us in Dallas texas I Andrew how are you\nI'm doing well are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nOh not a whole lot I recently took a new job we're

ruin about five days and weeks of buying a house out question right now mhm so I guess the next question what should be sitting in for said he couldn't be more into rock liar right artery or something I can do it for church future would you recommend\nWell you're at what we call babysit for sure you'd be starting to put Fifteen Percent of your income away for retirement or beyond that if you wanted to start piling some money into an investment to buy a home later that wouldn't be a bad thing but today it doesn't sound like you're on the market for home yeah\nYeah so it sounds like in to get your retirement savings started\nAnd a Fifteen Percent of your income going into that like your gross income before taxes point one five as Fifteen Percent\nAnd then get that started in your four one K. do it in a Roth if you can match or if you can if you can't uh then let's do we'll go to Ross on your own ... or ... on your own and let's make sure you're getting that money set aside if he'll say Fifteen Percent of your income throughout your whole life into good mutual funds in a retirement plan you'll be a millionaire usually a multi millionaire actually\nAnd um so we we can just at least get that started and then beyond that if you want to save towards a house or\nEven invest some money in aside mutual fund that's not a retirement account to use for house later you could do that but let's get Fifteen Percent of started and now let's see if you're going to fit it in the right direction so [noise]\nLike good question man like you for joining us from appreciate your hanging out that

crazy people\n[noise] so what's your\nWhat's that [noise] so what's your point\nMy point is that it doesn't matter about comedy it's about President Trump and keeping it it it all these people that you're I mean your wife are doing it but you see it as a west coast is occurring a kickback our focus on you but they need to focus on the gold goal is\nTo want to join us Supreme Court replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen Breyer that means voting Republican voter keeping a Senate trumping a wider\nWell it is here's the deal Tanya you're meeting President Trump at the White House today does

shop movie crowd calling Kanye you know what I make rather don't read ... B. E. T. orange crap oh that's cute\nI heard from people on the email machine today who said things like Michael I served my country as a marine\nWhen I was a Marine I was not a black Marie this was one guy wrote me earlier today which really affected me so I was in a combat unit\nAnd in the course of my life I have never felt more colorblind moment than when as a combat marine bullets start whizzing and I eat these start bona nobody said well old Bob he's black you\nKnow what they said we're part of a unit and they treated me just like everybody else and that's what my parents taught me and see if I find that email it was written better than I can give it credit for\nDon't make me turn this car around or because I said so or don't make me come back there I don't even really know what those things mean but I Know that I actually believe my parents when they sent them to me how did they manage to sound so convincing\nHere we go don't make me come back there [laughter] not tough enough all kids consent weakness\nDon't make me come back there yeah that's better in fact that kinda sounded like my dad weird you don't have to be perfect to be a perfect place eat\n[noise]\n\n\nForeigners\n\nYeah yeah\nOh yeah [noise] this is Mike that's me\nMy ... a real quick it's just a quick question I Know you know\nPrior to the election Trump getting elected sixteen\nYou know there weren't a lot of people that were just like you know overtly coming up the sport as the as the lights went on you know kind of hard to determine and he went on the attack and I know I'm listening to show you know ever since you've been on here I\nRemember ... when he ran for mayor or [laughter]\nAnyway\nWhen you know you're you're probably skeptical and their march made it more what do you feel like in this upcoming election\nThat there's folks like yourself that\nYou know maybe didn't see things that he'd be that great I'm Fred ... turning around dreams off all that what's your what's your opinion [noise]\nAh you know here's the\nProblem um it's hard to have that conversation I have come to the conclusion that my opinion of Donald Trump is not particularly important is just not um\nAnd for me to express what is a very complicated\n\nA response to him and his work is probably beyond the medium\nIn October of two thousand eight and I don't know that is particularly productive\nI Will say this [noise] um I did not wish for Trump to fail those not Michael\nI believed that Trump would be an awful president I Believe that he would be sort of a Jeff Flake a guy who got elected as a Republican governor as a Democrat\nI believed that in good faith based on his past\nI didn't ... it was it that I was ignorant of the life of Donald Trump I had done a lot of research and I believed that he would be awful but I hoped he would be good\nAnd the reason is I don't let my ego get in the way of the much bigger issue I'm going to be dead and gone and my children are going to be my age and I want them to live in a great country\nAnd I don't think that that's a fait accompli I don't think that it's naturally the case that this country will be great thirty five years from now just because we've always been great I think we have to make good decisions\nI think that it's hard work to stay at the top you see countries that rise and fall\nIf if you look at the the change in fortunes in China in\nIndia for instance\nIf you look at where Japan was in currently is well Vietnam for that matter or Cambodia\nCountry's rise and fall based on decisions that they make and I want our country it'd be great I'm fine I'm financially secure I have a great job or I get to\nDo what I Love to do my family's all healthy knock on wood I mean I'm\nPretty lucky guy so I don't need to be right I Am delighted that I'm wrong about Donald Trump and I say it often to me that's the measure of a man can you admit when you make a mistake\nThat's the measure of ... most people will readable most people will will will backfill\nAnd make excuses bill claim things that weren't true [noise]\nBut I don't want to be that guy that's not who I Want to be that's not the example I Want to set to listeners to my children and I did not believe that Trump would govern the way he has\nBut what I care more about than Donald Trump or my ego\nIs what's good for this country Donald Trump has done almost nothing that I disagree with withdrawing from the Paris accord\nIt's a relatively meaningless act I mean if that's your you know conservative you know championship it's appearing victory\nBut it's a victory standing behind cabinet all the tax cuts in December I mean\nTrump has done things that not only did I not believe he would do\nHe's done things that Bush didn't do and here we go he's done things that Reagan didn't and you won't find a bigger fan than me of the Reagan Administration but I also know the shortcoming\nTrump is not being president in order to have ceremonial ribbon cutting Z or speech five Trump is using the power of that office\nAs as authorized and empowered by the constitution to move this country in a very positive direction\nRepublicans are doing a great job in the house and a great job in the Senate and his leadership is showing these people after a career in politics you can make a difference\nAnd the American people will support you even when the New York times and the Washington Post cause you a racist as in a photo of anti gay you name it\nSo yeah Trump's doing an amazing job [noise]\nAn amazing job [noise] and I am proud I Am happy I Am delighted [noise] I Am [noise]\nWell [noise] I couldn't be happier\nMichael berry she'll continues\n\nDevastation and its way ...
