released that information\nJust before the voting started and I suppose he still could [noise]\nBut why would he wait until after the midterms to present his key findings as they are calling them on the Russia probe\nLet's presume for a moment he has nothing and at this point he has presented nothing\nHad his trouble we haven't Manafort up that Manafort had a stroke but his trouble related to not paying taxes Michael Cohen had his trouble his trouble had to do with the fact that he was basically running a criminal enterprise in addition to being a lawyer\nSo why wouldn't you present this

U.S officials reported on Wednesday that Mueller is close to finalizing his inquiry into a pair of the most\nImportant aspects of the investigation now the cynical Saddam he says the fact that they've come out this early with plenty of time to cure the potential delay in presenting the evidence\nThat it creates the time for the appearance of a groundswell of demand that Mueller let us know what's going on before the midterms\nAnd that would put Mueller end of the situation like candidates who create their own a a a activity there most of their own interest by saying they've been asked\nTo run their never asked to run they want to run there's no one asking them run\nThey just say that it could be that Mueller is creating all of this doing all this engaging and all this\nSo it could look like well people were asking me to present this before the November ... turns midterms than [noise]\nOkay I guess I Will [noise]\nWhen you're on the ball\nOn the Michael berry ... [noise]\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall us today and let's get some sort\nWe have injected too much of the\nCriminal justice apparatus into our political system\n... the court system has intruded too far into the political system\nThe process was designed for change for the public's approval and disapproval to be registered in the form of votes and so rather than Mueller\nDoing this big investigation what\nWe really have to recognize is it the American people elected Donald Trump and the leadership of the FBI\nDidn't want Donald Trump they want to Hillary Clinton and so they\nManaged using their friends in the media using their friends in the PR community and in the\nOpposition research the silent assassin crowd\nAnd [noise] with unlawfully disclosing suspicious activity reports activity reports SARS and conspiracy to do the same [noise] she was arrested yesterday and we'll presented this will be presented this afternoon in the United states district court for the eastern district of Virginia\nBeginning in approximately October of two thousand Seventeen and lasting until the president Edwards unlawfully disclosed numerous SARS to a reporter reporter won\nThe substance of which were published over the course of approximately twelve articles by news organization for which reporter one wrote this organization want these are they use is to keep them having to tell you who they were\nThe illegally disclosed SARS pertain to to among other things Paul Manafort Richard Gates the Russian embassy Maria Butina and privacy on Alexander\nEdwards had access to each of the ... SARS and saved them along with thousands of other files containing sensitive government information to a flash drive provided to her about fen phen\nShe transmitted the SARS to reporter won by means that included taking photographs of them and texting the photo rest reporter one over an encrypted application\nIn addition to disseminating SARS to reporter one she sent reporter one internal ... emails appearing to relate to SARS or other information protected by the BSA\nAnd fen phen non public memoranda including investigated memos and intelligence assessments published by the fence and intelligence division which contained confidential business\nPersonal and other security threat is assessments\nAt the time of her as she was in possession of a flash\nDrive appearing to be the flash drive on which she saved the unlawfully disclosed SARS and a cell phone containing numerous communications over an encrypted application and which she transmitted SARS and other sensitive government information to reporter one\nThat's the end of it but\nThe Justice Department's press release which is what I'm reading from concludes with according to the criminal indictment Edwards was in possession of over twenty four thousand SARS and other documents\nOver twenty four thousand suspicious activity reports\nWhere there's no reason to believe she stopped at just sending a few\nSo let's go back and review so now Manafort's information was being stolen by bureaucrats and given to the media comb he was handing over information to the media using his friend at the New York to his friend at Columbia they handed over to the New York times\n[noise] uh\nWe know that between McCain and or and straws it and they're ill and called me\nAt the FBI we know what they were doing the information we remember what the IRS was doing to keep people from campaigning against Morocco bomb [noise] these people\nAre criminal threatening our Republican from\nAll great cities in between\nMultiplying our corporate money far from over the phone from one of my former farming falling from\nPerforming in front and vote on ... ... ... ... ... ...

answer his art with you 'cause you're\nSo here we are two years in [noise]\nWill confess I have worried that Mueller who is very crafty\nVery sly very clever\nVery mean nasty man that he would give the impression he was going to indict Trump\nAnd then he would do it right before the midterms I had been afraid of that I did not give voice to that but I've been afraid of that\nAnd I'm Still not sure that will happen I don't know that he could get an indictment and there's an old line and legal circles that good prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich\nSort of like the old line at the earlier level in the criminal justice\nProcess you can beat the rat but you can't beat the ride you know anybody can sue you you can throw it out of court but the media didn't get sued\nAnd if you're getting married tomorrow and the story emerges that you've been arrested or you've been sued or you've been accused your future inlaws Milo is put off this election for I mean this uh marriage for a couple of weeks\nWe might be dealing with the bad guy what turns out he didn't do anything wrong but at that moment the accusation will always have hanging in the air well maybe it's true and I've been worried that Mueller would do this\nBut now there is considerable speculation and this is where the game of chicken begins this is where it gets complicated and this is where Trump is good Trump met with roses team recently when air force one\nThe expectation was Trump was going to fire Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice roses sees one who appointed a special prosecutor it all goes back to Jeff Sessions\nSessions after he becomes attorney general\nHe then says oh allegations of Russian collusion\nWell I was a part of the campaign I had meetings I'm going to step down when he stepped down the guy he would've never appointed a special prosecutor special counsel but when he stepped down Rod Rosenstein steps in and says\nWe're going to bring in Robert Mueller a close friend of Jim Comey insists the president has fired combing we're gonna bring in the special prosecutor the special counsel and we're basically going to torment Trump and there's no reason to believe they're going to stop anytime soon\nThis is where it gets to be like a game of\nBattle did you play by ... has a good game it's quality game\nIs a quality gay you call it out then they made an electric where do you have electronic version they had the electronic version [noise] if you put your your piece a certain spot and there's was on it would make a like a blow up south\nYeah we had to do it like gotcha to for to be one battle she you remember so you just moved to\nOkay All right well now we've got a game of cat and mouse going high stakes cat and mouse because Mueller if he presents his evidence before the ... terms he gets to\nFirst day of your career it's on your mind I Want to be so good I Want to be that among the best at what I've done I Want a one day where that Jack and be sworn in to the hall\nBut if you serve your country in the military those guys don't think in terms of one day I Want to be invited to the halls of political power in this country\nWith the\nThe gold drapes behind me and the lectern a flag the room crowded and Fox News carrying it live and the president put a metal around my neck they don't think in those terms\nAnd I think maybe that's what makes it special is that they did not compromise or cash you enter a sellout or pursue their simply\nBeing recognized for incredible incredible\nValor and when that blue ribbon goes around their neck and the president ties it in the back they have the\nThe the look on their face seemingly like this is taking forever\nBecause these are the highest ranking guys in the military\nThey're not used to the spotlight these are the guys that actually fight the wars these are the guys at the the lowest levels that are seeing bullets whiz by they're just not accustomed to this\nAnyway I I didn't want this day to go by without I Want to show about without noting that\n[noise] so by Melendez um\nIt was on trial his buddy who was convicted gave him a lot of money and flew them around on his private jet they went down to the Dominican Republic where he supposedly cured for Bob Menendez teenage girls\nMenendez used as his defense oh he was bribing me were just really good friends friends do these things for free as\nWell but he was under investigation and he did get political favors dawn on his behalf\nWellman end as managed to save his scout but it's unclear whether he'll be able to save his political career the biggest Senate Democrat pack about to drop three million dollars in New Jersey just say Menendez is the the Huffington Post writes\nSenate majority pac which is controlled by

president Donald Trump in a state where the president\nIs deeply unpopular [laughter] so it was at a fundraiser for Mendez it Hillary crashed her van on Monday Night for Hillary she can't do anything right\nHugging the Republicans have been hitting Menendez heart over the under aged prostitutes down in the Dominican Republic but I'm not sure it's going to matter I'm increasingly I've opinion that Democrats don't care as long as they went\nSo now Chuck Schumer is going to drop three million dollars in what should have been a safe Democrat seat\nThree million dollars you know\nProbably could use some of that thirty eight million that ... has raised mark my words when this election is over ...\nRock in Texas will be sitting on a huge chunk of change if he only wanted\nTo win the Senate seat from Texas\nHe would spend every penny of it but he won't and he hasn't and the reason is made on knows he can't win the seat the more money they spend the further he falls behind him\nHe'll end up losing fifty five forty bucks it might even be fifty six forty four\nHe'll lose about ten percentage points he's down consistently by seven points or more and then you have to factor in the turnout model remember that when they show these polls they don't just randomly interview six hundred to a thousand people\nThey have estimates on what percentage of people are going to be Republicans and what percentage are going to be Democrats would show up to vote [noise] they have estimates on percentage of old people and young people that are going to show up to vote\nOh yourself she told the
