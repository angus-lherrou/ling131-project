[noise]\nSomebody that chat room saying are you trying to print something it's true that if you tried to if you had a corrupt print driver which could cause a blue screen and every time you build it up and tried to load that that would cause it it's probably do a driver that's getting loaded when you first turn on the computer how far does it get before blue screens\nWell it does start last time it was instantaneous before that a few times that gave me some time and I managed to get a little research in and bad drivers as one of the main causes\nA on it and so one of the things\nI tried to do is go in and modify change out or delete some stopped some drivers [noise] but I got confused doing I I probably did the wrong thing let me kind of if I\nWould I Would do here's one diagnostic and unfortunately and windows ten is a different way to do this but if you can start windows ten in safe mode\nAnd you would then not load the majority of drivers your screener would look terrible because you'd have a V. Ga display driver over\nLast night I got into safe mode\nAnd did it run reliably in safe mode\nWell it did but it saves motives when I was trying to do these correct\nIs yeah you know I mean you nobody wants to stay in safe mode but if you can boot up in safe mode\nUsually that means that something that's loading some drivers loading not in safe mode is causing the problem is so so if it was completely reliable in safe mode almost always I look at the video drivers so the first thing I Would do is is\nGetting newer video drivers for your machine is is your machine from a major manufacturer okay so go or you might need to do this in safe mode or another computer\nBut go to jail and go to that area for specifically that computer you know you have a Dell um service number use that to get to the exact page\nAnd download all of the drivers for that system and re installed them sometimes that that will think make it say a stapler\nBecause then you're replacing those drivers with something more up today um I Would bet that is the first thing I Would do and I would bet that that's what's going on it if you so safe mode ran okay\nIt it did until I started you know trying to do some corrective actions and I was following instructions that I I got\nOn the Internet [laughter] I don't know I got it from Microsoft okay good\nThat's true that is a job in itself I Know voted that\nAnd then I transferred under chrome on my on my own my own books are still have that available\nYeah [noise] but kind of thing where they have and you do [noise]\nIs you know I was confused I'd have to\nGo it would take me a long time but it um all it is\nThe problem with doing stuff and you don't know what you're doing it and you can really get all sorts of mischief that way um\nWell no I appreciate that and and it's you know my wife wanted it's time for you to get a new computer and I said well hopefully I can get this done and I was thinking\nIt might be able to here's a here's the real thing to do once you go into safe mode type uh you know when a skiing type recovery and go into a recovery mode that will let you kind of re install\nA windows it'll keep your data there's various levels there's one level that will raise your drive and you'll lose all your data but there are several levels that will let you refresh windows without racing any data and that's the windows ten has some very good recovery mode I Would definitely try those you could do those from safe mode\nUh so I I Would see you know see if any of those tools\nYou have a reset this PC\n[noise] which is\nWhich is pretty good if you do the reset this PC and choose keep my files it'll refresh the system without getting rid of anything you want to keep you have a backup of everything\nI just you know all my data not worried about my day to have all that\nWell worst case you can wipe the drive and start over she's got a good backup felt\nThe thing is I Want to replace the drive anyway within is\nWell now's the time I was a great\nTime and if it now the only problem is if it's a hardware problem other than the drivers if it's you know maybe your mother board is your whatever\nYou you might be replacing the drive in the computer will still be problematic for this than it's much more serious and your wife is right and I think given spousal approval buying a new computer is not a bad thing\nThanks for the call I appreciate it I Want to talk about remote PC before we get all that I hear it lets you easily and securely access your PC or Mac at home or office anywhere even with your mobile devices as like teleport ing PC Magazine just gave her mo PC for stars and excellent rating\nThey said ... effort was with a simple interface in learning curve fast performance users can easily transfer files between local and wrote that stops it's a great way to do remote support a great way to get files you leave it at home at the office or vice versa\nAnd it's six dollars less than six dollars a month for putting computers it's a great deal except I'm gonna make it even better\nUse my namely or remote PC dot com when you check out to get Ninety percent off for the first year they're practically giving it away go to a remote PC dot com signed up today used by named Leo and get Ninety percent off the Leo tech weekend special remote PC dot com thanks so much\nTo Michael cozy our musical director ...
