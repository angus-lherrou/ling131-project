Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio his daughter has special needs\nAnd he was on vacation about Twenty years ago his is a wealthy man he ... he retired and he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in a pool with some kids and when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kid they just grab the ball and got out and he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment\nSo he decided that there was no place in the world that had a place for people with special needs and and who don't want to come together so he created this water park thirty six million dollars\nIn San Antonio and it's all twelve percent of the population has special needs and America that's not a freebie oh yeah and so now they're big they're big thing was that you know for kids who aren't electric or in a wheelchair that's powered by either electric or battery or they have a breathing machine\nThey could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create a wheelchair that was that one hundred work wheelchair oh my God so they did it in a video like that but by using compressed air and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp\nFor for ... with a zip line and there and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can do is applying with kids in wheelchairs of breathing apparatus that that is so cool\nBut you got to watch this video on creating a post right now I'm time magazine actually not time magazine time magazine named one of the world's greatest places\nBut New York times did an amazing video on it and now I'm I'll tweet it or put it in a ... in the chat room but this guy is amazing he really is the guy should run for president United States but anyway um [noise] if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice\nOn how to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on a zip line\nOh his line oh that yeah well they're pretty that sounds like they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a a lot of water slide wow a line but you don't need to take the wheelchair on the line or do you I think you do so you want to share with them\nYeah that's interesting very huh so what have you heard of that out then it's such a neat idea Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio Texas for I just want it in a magazine or ...\nAnd then you got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see that at least family I just that I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate I'm so he flew British Airways if a nonstop flight\nSix hours or only sixty five people on or triple seven ... and love it because then you could spread out a fire in the face on roe [laughter] yeah basically he did and um [noise] so anyway here's another website for you is is\nUm if you want to be treated like a celebrity and I don't know if you've ever seen celebrities go through airports I see it all the time in LA when they department they transfer or when they arrive they just get whisked through\nAnd so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and then it's called um black lean pass black Elaine pass\nSo black way I talked about them before because they do a car service real good car service but now\nThey have this past where they do in five hundred airports worldwide they will scorched you so it was perfect for my mother in law 'cause my mother in law was meeting us in London but she was flying into Heathrow were planning to get wick and she's a little bit of a nervous traveler so I arranged for her to be\nFor a hundred dollars someone was waiting to moments he stepped off the plane so when you go on a website leader but you don't have to sign up ahead of time\nNo with no clear is different clears for um security in certain airports\nThis is so when she landed in London literally when they open up the door there was a there was a person they're holding a sign with her name by say grab their bags they walk through they cut the line for immigration so she'd have to wait an hour in immigration lines I\nDo that I think they got to deal with the costs they had to order exactly wow and then they get your bags\nAnd then they go through customs and then you get they put you in a car if you order a car you can order carpet black lane already ... wherever you could whenever transportation you want you can take a bus but they'll put you on there and she was like when we arrived she's ... like that was the best thing ever\n'cause I've been ... I'd never felt like this and\nAgain so it's perfect for people who are either nervous or business travelers who don't want to\nI Would do this for my mom does not want to fly says eighty five years old she doesn't want to fly in her real fears that confusion once you're on the plane it's minus the confusion getting on and off she's you know she's really getting lost or whatever so this will be a great\nThing what a couple of years ago I had my dad fly from LA he met me in Budapest and he had to go LA London Budapest and I wish this was available I knew about it because I was so worried about him getting long lunch and yeah and yeah I\nI Love and he wrote I get lost in Heathrow it's a nightmare [noise] yes and um so anyway this is a perfect thing for business travelers for families it's each the price a difference but it's usually around a hundred dollars per person so it was a hundred dollars for my mother in law for that\nThey often have more features they uh they do things to improve your caught activity over time as they observe what you're doing all of these things make it a better wife I experience for most people\nThere is one downside on mash up plumes started they started charging you a yearly subscription or a monthly fee\nAnd and the idea is well look we want to keep this up to date will want to keep developing it we want to keep improving it and we're not and that's the problem right when you bought a forty dollar links his route are linked to just wipe their hands and thanks good luck upon by\nAnd so uh I think it's not inappropriate for router company to say\nLook we ... you know we have additional features you can pay for euro are one of our sponsors does that as well and I pay for the euro plus nine nine bucks and you get a lot of extra stuff including a password manager of VPN you get a filtering content filtering you'd get ad blocking can you get regular updates so\nThat's something to be aware of mesh routers costs more basically both in initially and over time on the other hand they really do make a difference how big is this space\nAs a working artist or a house\nOkay so it's not a huge ... most space stations will cover that easily a single ...\nThe question or the concern that I have though is a fight with the airport three of software that through networks one for this one for one for the ... oldest comments I'm In San ... is from our systems is that while it's casting votes you can ... separate network ... figure\nYeah the idea that ... the idea behind bashes will do it you just take it from here and I have to say in most cases unless you really know what you're doing that the best way to do it\nAt people and people can there's a lot of ... that people can think they are going to choose the channel I'm going to choose the frequency I'm going to make it better and they screw things up so unless you're a network acts are indoor\nOh yeah I set up for it says you need to do it or they have to choose\nWhether ring should automatically a good I O T device and I will not all of them do this but will no no that that's the two point four and be on the two point four actually with the ... with the ...

twenty twenty five this'll be commonplace everybody would just like everybody has a smartphone\nAnd it's really gonna change the way we see the world because it'll be another layer superimposed on the
