Fifteen ten ...\nBug fixes that kind of thing they call it patch Tuesday\nIn fact Tuesday is patch Tuesday [noise] last Tuesday Microsoft said All right they had a big event to show off new hardware new surface pros and the surface laptops studios and so forth and at the event they said and today we're proud to say we will begin pushing out the new feature\nUpdate they call it Eighteen own nine 'cause in the September twenty Eighteen except suck Tobar but it's close enough so that's it you know nine [noise] last one was Eighteen of three\nBut it came out in may so eight five but I but any ...\nPay no attention to the numbers that's not the most important thing the most important thing is is it you know these they do these a couple of times a year and windows ten remember they said when does tend to last version of windows were not going to a ship all windows eleven\nWe're just gonna keep updating keep improving windows tan and we're going to do that to three times a year it's turned out to be really two times a year with these big feature updates\nExcept that almost immediately people started saying whoa that feature up I stole the Wii job they believe it all my documents one guy in the Microsoft\nSupport board said\nI had two hundred twenty gigabytes documents documents folders\nGone oh\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested this as they have in the past with millions of people\nThe current you know eight to nine has been tested for six months work there get tested the next one already with these people who volunteer maybe you're one of them it's the windows insider program\nYou'd think if this thing did that except maybe the installers the last piece of the puzzle right maybe they didn't they hadn't been really testing the installer\nSo maybe they did you know forget to tested thoroughly high on no anyway Microsoft and they have pulled back Eighteen online\nSo um\nYou won't be able to get a teen how nine if you were all excited about it\nProbably few people have the ... the way it generally works it was assumed that they Microsoft wasn't going to start kind of\nSaying you know you know how they do that with pop ups hey there's a new version of what has won install they until Tuesday till patch Tuesday so that people who got it where what Microsoft calls seekers\nI Am a seeker I'm a seeker of truth of wisdom end of windows updates and I got it because if you went to windows update and actively said what's that what's new anything new it would say well yeah there's this new feature update you want it\nI installed it on at least three\nComputers Lenovo that I have in front of me the AT T for Seventy yes last year as a laptop I installed it on a surface go the new little mini surfaced that Microsoft put out a couple of months ago I saw it on my big surface studio the on\nOne no problems as far as I Know no documents deleted [noise]\nBut to some people didn't have that problem not unknown why hope you didn't and don't worry Microsoft is pausing they say that's the word they're not pulling it back then that withdrawing pausing\nPausing it nothing to fear here [noise] ah we had the iPhone announcement that's usually the big fall announcement right in August Samsung announced the note nine very nice phone\nThere's another shoe to drop typically in October Google announced this new stuff and yes Tuesday Google as having an event in New York City\nHash tag made by Google\nThere's really no I think there will be no surprises here we've been looking at the Google Pixel three leaks have been coming out for months I just read a review of it a review of it it hasn't even announced yet apparently a Hong Kong or retailer\nHad one and sold it to an end gadget reviewer and so he's reviewed it it's pretty clearly the you know the real deal ... very nicely package solid and so forth [noise] uh nothing nothing to see here it's nothing surprising we also I\nThink get a new chrome or west powered they're going to call it all the leaks say pixels slight it'll be a tablet you can add a keyboard to\nA pixel book to an update to chrome cast and perhaps something people are calling the home hub hub everybody's got a home of now\nWe live in this kind of sigh load world where um [noise] if you want to automate your home you get to choose do you want Sam something to do

us so we'll see what Google has to offer they don't really have a hub quite yet this is their chance I get the assistant right [noise]\nEighty eight eighty eight ethically out those are the big stories of the week there's more but really I Know you care more about what's\nGoing on in your life and so do I so give me a ring you have a problem to share question a solution an answer eighty eight eighty eight asked me oh eight eight eight eight two seven five five three six\nWhen I when we talk of course the answers are all posted on the website I should tell you that too it's free it's open it's widely available to all at no charge or sign up a tech guy labs contact guy labs dot com\nOr should they brought to you by remote PC as the name implies that allows you to access a PC a windows machine or a Mac works either way when you're not at your home or office desk\nWhen you're on the road from any kind of computer a PC or Mac or you don't have you could go back to BC windows machine to Mac you can even use a portable devices a tablet or a phone\nIt's not so you can try you know Android email programs so you're blue in the face and ... and you still have the same problem because it's not the program itself it's it's go Debbie in the mail servers doing it\nOr how do you get around it I don't know I mean I Would I generally will first of all I map which is probably the protocol you're using yes\nA isn't really designed for downloading the emails designed for cashing in what's on the server but the server is the definitive store and that's not on your phone or computer anything is on your premises it's on the uh the the ...\nYou know email providers premises so that is your ... you know I met president really designed for you to download anything just cash is it\nSo if you really want to download and you should investigate with and I bet you this is the case the go daddy server will support pop three which is the old member of post office protocol that allows you to download all the mail and find a a pop three\nOr Android email program that will support pop three I don't know if canine will do it that's the most um [noise] that's the most powerful email pap I Know of on Android K dash night it's open source\nIt probably support yes supports pop\nSo would you put it in ... do you use the ... server\nFor go daddy instead of the IMF server and then you download it may still um say all you can only have twenty but tomorrow you can get twenty more tomorrow after day after that after that and over time you can gather all the mail basically that's what pop three design for pop\nThree ... the older political was designed for you to log into your mail server clean it out and then uh and because that was because her dress bases expensive in an ISPs didn't want to keep your mail nowadays because we have many devices the ice be keeps your mail and the devices are just a window into the server that makes sense\n[noise] real quick thing yes if\nYou don't have any more callers one quick thing about football I was a a dinner for my wife's work and we're like five couples and I said I Can't watch football it's what Thirteen minutes compressed into two and a half to three hours my wife my take I have time to cut or\n[laughter] it's not merely engaging [laughter]\nYou need an action movie if you want to avoid cuddling [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nNo that's true it is it's eleven to Thirteen minutes of action spread out over a three hour period it's kind of amazing I Do fortunately have more calls thank goodness so I appreciate it mark thank you so much they listen in and you know it's it's true if you want to you could just\nLeave oh then were bogus [noise] watch the whole thing and Thirteen\nWe'll avoid the tech guy more you're going to\nUse and whether twenty four hours a day and then when he will eat the dot com\n\n\n\n... the heck [noise] eighty eight eighty eight ethically owe the phone\nAnd Greg's on the line from a homeless that's a Florida am I saying that right\nOh Sasha homeless us out nice to have\nWell I Wish I could but [laughter]\nAnd I talked to you it's just a figure [laughter]\nOh okay my problem is cable company in it and it was the one all digital and\nNow they charge from you have to have a box for every to me so I that's far TVs I ... I Need to extend my wife fight so that I can get a fire sticks or something like that for the other team east right and they can uh\nDo it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or if there's a better brand or main\n[noise] yeah this is a\n... am I saying are the most out of things to\nBe the wire the whole house by horse but who's going to do that nobody was still on the addict yeah yeah of course\nYeah I I keep I'm tempted to do that in my house in the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces underneath but then who wants to go into their that's even worse than the addict [laughter] lighter so a\nHorse or worse the\nCable companies took advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and I remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital Turner and stuff the cable companies pretended that this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital or\nYou know there's advantages for them they can get more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth than just getting digital packets on there so you get more challenge et cetera et cetera et cetera [noise]\nUh but of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over your old companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or you know YouTube TV or whatever\nThey do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be challenged\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and streams some stuff but there's a lot of offering\nYeah what you'll notice on why fires the farther you get the less signal you get\nAnd thought I signal you get the less speed you get it's a direct correlation so we want to boost the signal now uh it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point that has to do Lebanese see are you\n[laughter] you're ... Mike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent that's how we sold a\nDecent life by it's not fair Sal um it's just that uh they also have the the the lock on that as well we're very rural so the only choice we\nHad oh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend it most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife fi router\nI did I did do that\nYeah okay good so you ... ... if they if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know a router part of it just disabled that or at least turn off the wife I radio\nIf you can turn off the wife ... radio that'll eliminate signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we called bridge mode say let the uh cable modem route or because it's still around her and they decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why fire routers\nUm hero sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from net gear a veil op from is that links as I can never remember there's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things and these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all the audience and then they have some units typically you buy a a a little sub unit for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might\nMight buy more and and these these little extra units are are like repeaters but they're better than so you can get a repeat or for your existing non mesh system\nBut what will happen is the repeaters takes half of the time talking to the route to the base station and the other half of the time talking to you so we all wife I extenders cut wife I speed\nIn half\nThe nature of all why standard because they can't operate in what we call full duplex ... they can't they can't do two things at once they can only either talk to the route or talk to you so that's split than a half\nThe ... have a back channel this is the ... the main difference have a back channel they use to communicate with the base station it doesn't slowed down\nSo the ... and this is why it's the best solution for somebody who's trying to expand their wife I footprint and plume is another one that's uh that's I use both plume in hero in my house there lots of companies all you have to look for mesh\nUm the problem is the expense because you're not only buying a base you know you're going to buy one or two or three extra extenders in the end they usually start at three hundred dollars and uh they go up usually around a hundred hundred and fifty bucks per extender so you haven't been able to\nFace outlook probably really solve the problem and as some of them uh most of them have additional features for instance the heroes or\nHave if you pay extra I think it's a hundred bucks a year erode plus which has filtering so it keeps your kids off of bad sites that has things like you can say to your echo pause a juniors why fine in his will go off um and you get yours will continue they have lots of nice features guest they have guests networks\nThey really do they have like a timer\nThey do we have whatever she will be on all\nNight and I do this with our teenager at ten pm on school nights the router goes off however it only goes off for them mom and dad can stay up late 'cause we're Ross yeah that's cool so you get the joy\nOut of our own say or else our phone signals terrible too so I\nAm so I knew I wouldn't need it they got the five hundred minutes they give me per month I knew I'd never run out of that but anyway let's got to my problem is\nI forgot the password to get access to the phones because I've got so many of them and I I I just I I Am in my brain doesn't work right I'm working on probably three brain cells\nAnd losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen to my brain that's also a lot to make an excuse for it\nNo you don't have to make excuses and by the way everybody forgets the six\nSix December and that's part of my problem to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad enough but I\nDon't don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or is it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it\nLike okay\nSo on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be a little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down but on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is too\nA race it and start over do you mind doing that\nThough I don't mind that at all okay\nSo it's kind of depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode\nNow the easiest ways of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone is ... so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking it and you can do that but you're gonna have to figure out\nYou know inject here's the first thing I'd try it works on most Android phones you precedent hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time and that'll put you in recovery\nMode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google your manufacturer and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever but what what what the commander in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky because you have to do it in there you know just kind of at the same time and volume up button and you have to\nYou said volume up and power at the same Iowa yeah\nAnd you you hold it and then once you ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing and holding the power off button\nSo power power at all the way down then press the power in volume button together and you'll see you should see and most of these phones face a text based menu that the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume buttons up or down through the menu and then you press the power button to select and so you're going to select reset and a reset will just a race the phone take it back is if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in a while\nI did just buy it at all I did was get it able to connect to my wife by that I hadn't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any\nPerfect perfect and then now some people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you narrow\nZero so it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down a ... the only issue would be if somebody could get access to the notebook beer writing it right but as long as people are going\nTo get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually it yeah here in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up get a new book I I've actually I've actually seen these in I'm In the like the targets and stuff they this is I don't know if there's a good idea but I you know what to say passwords\nOn the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this notebook but\nMaybe don't have one that says passerby just get a new book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer\nAnd any time you set a code a password whatever\nJust write it down okay that's your password fall\nThere was a second issue with them is they always want to keep updating just the apps that came with it right\nAnd they only have eight eight ... gigabytes of hard drives space and only one gig of memory and I'm always getting low memory and\nOut of space memory 'cause every time they do an update their updates or at least twenty to thirty gigabytes fits or LED lights I'm Sorry yeah labs up over time when you're getting a little frequently and so\nBut you do want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a U ... most of the time those updates update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as yet they've done to delete it and they'll not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost of the time updates don't add to the amount of size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay [noise]\nIt does leave in downloaded folder the ... or the day that you download it and you can delete that okay\nYeah it was the lead to buy a automatically oh oh okay yeah I Know windows and they always do that oh that's\nRight windows does not it as soon as you have a lot of room but Android understands it in many cases the spaces scanned so it it will delete those don't you worry and if it does it you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle up to a thirty two gigabytes card\nOh well that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most of the time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move pictures there any media any data files can be moved to the external card and that will free up space uh once you put in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see of a card you want to put pictures there and you just say yes and that will free of space but it doesn't you can't put apps there\nRobert it's great to talk to you again keep calling okay love hearing

twenty people killed yesterday in a crash involving a limo in upstate New York authorities saying the limo blew past a stop sign\nSo it's a great idea\nYou know this is that this is an interesting debate in uh in photography\nIt's a great idea to to get into your changeable lens camera because you could do different things with different lenses you know a telephoto lens is great for sports and other events where you can't get close to the action a wide angle lens is great for\nArchitecture and landscapes you know taking and and if we're portrait sure you want a slightly longer lands maybe uh eighty five millimeter lens\nOr they can handle low light and that way you can get great portraits\nOr with great depth of field you know the background kind of fades away and the end of portrait pops out so each lens has different features different attributes a lot of photographic a teacher's suggest however\nAnd you know the temptation is going to be the get the kit lands which usually the twenty wide goes why does kind of somewhat telephoto twenty four to seven to your ... something like that\n[noise] um [noise]\nIs a nice all purpose lens a lot of teachers to just starting with a single prime lands of Fifteen millimeter latch which approximate the guy\nAnd really teaches composition because instead of just zooming in and out you actually have to think about it and move closer move farther away really think about what you're getting that's going to be up to you and your daughter she's going to say no dad\nI don't want to have to do all that I just want one lens and and and then you're then you're kind of yeah you get one zoom lens the kit lands and then the question is well what do I need any other lake water yeah yeah it does it all\nI liked the idea of having a good low light they they tend to be more expensive the the the the how much light gathering is determined by the what we call the aperture how big the opening and get and it's it's it's it's an inverse so the lower the F stop the wider the aperture so\nWhen you see a lens that can do F. one point a to F one point I even at one point for those are lenses that have a wider can go wider opening and capture more light which means they're great for not using flash for for getting a natural images they're great for torture\nThey tend to be more expensive and you'll never see assume we call it a fast lens when it can do that you'll ever see assume that fast\nBecause it's just too expensive a fast zoom is maybe two point four three point five something like that and okay so I think about\nInstead of getting the ... getting a body and then getting a nice say F. one point for fifty millimeter lands I think that would be a great teaching lands but you've got to talk to her and she's got to agree with you\nAs far as which body to get it this is an important decision because if you're getting an interchangeable lens camera you're buying into a system if you get a cannon or an icon and you're going to be going candidate I called lenses forever after you know because they have custom mounts each of them\nSo you're making a decision in that regard\nRight now I'm a kind of a fan of the ... ah I was a cannon shooter for years and actually I currently shoot Sony's which are mirror lists\nUh but ... but for her first camera maybe an icon de thirty five hundred [noise] uh this is a good ... camera it's all you know it starts at five hundred bucks\nOkay uh it is the sensors size is another thing that people often talk about and this is an A. P. S. C. center which is a large censor but not full framed full framed gets very expensive ultimately that's what she's going to want\nBut I think this the D. thirty five hundred is a very nice very high quality camera or you could buy a kit get the twenty four Seventy a lens that goes with the kid\nA it is here's what I Would do is the other thing you can look at is deep he reviewed dot com digital photography review dot com they have a best camera for beginners buying guide that we'll talk about the pros and cons they liked the can and the one you were looking at the ios rebel Estelle to\nOkay ah that's another very nice one but that talk about the pros and cons of each\nAnd I'm going to throw in one third one that is to me are the most flexible solution\nWhich is an Olympic is oh MD now this is a smaller censor it some ... what we call micro for third censor the micro for thirds cameras have one big advantage many companies make the lenses so you have many of whom literally hundreds of choices of lenses\nAnd that is kind of nice my wife shoots at oh empty\nA EM five I think more mark or I Can't remember ... ... am one mark five something like that anyway it's a very the O M deserved compact they are interchangeable ends and you have a huge number of choices\nOf lenses so I Would I go to deep you review read the beginner best camera for beginners buying guide they also have a best camera for students guide a and that will give you some more information um the the three cameras I've mentioned here are absolutely top\nOf the line cameras and it's a great project for her to be involved in it unless you want to do it as a Christmas gift\nYeah okay and I think she would like to be that yeah what's\nYour thoughts about any advantages of a picking up some specifically a a ... a brand name a number or Amazon versus a local camera store\nAs a matter of doesn't matter I buy most of my cameras on Amazon okay okay good enough to support local\nCameras stores have you happen to have one but [noise] the prices are going to be a little higher there and you know our local cameras are disappearing even though I support them\nSo I Will report\n[noise]\nListen to I hard Radio Free app at W.
