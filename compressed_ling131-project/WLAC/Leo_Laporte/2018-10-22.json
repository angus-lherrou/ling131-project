V. receiver that's the first cost and that's about three or four hundred dollars and then for anywhere from a thousand to Fifteen hundred dollars you can get\nA five point one surround systems that sounds so much better\nSo much better speaking of you know we're going to do we're going to change microphones 'cause I I thought I'd steal Heather's microphone I'm getting\nPaid for a paid back for it 'cause her microphones little buzzy oh it just got better a little bit\nLet me take another call and I'm gonna switch microphones while we do that a back to line one mark in Grand Rapids Michigan\nHi Leo good to talk to my friend [noise] I'm a I was thinking I made a mistake about three months ago when I went back to a Comcast TV [noise]\nYeah what happened just so you you were what were you doing before Comcast\nOr a TV we were strength\nWe cut the cord though you said I don't want cable I'm going to save money I'm going to get everything over the Internet or over the top as they did that save your money just out of curiosity\nSay quite a bit of money on or about a hundred dollars a month I mean a lot about in ten of put on the house and that was good\nLast the last deal and television is over the air if you could do it\n[noise] yeah well that's why I went back contest they started having been problems with the er em\nYeah so anyway Comcast you get a little itchy you know so they're given some really good deals elsewhere content for TV\nI remember I here's the deal income catch if you could recover cast also if you go into the office\nBecause they have offices are often they're like storefronts and up and talk to the human or ...\nOr you can often get a great deal they have wonderful offers but the trick is the only uh you know worked for the first year\nAnd then all of a sudden you build doubles so the trick and I asked I asked the woman she said yeah we we always have something just keep coming back before the for the years out ask for the new deal yeah so that's just something to keep in mind [noise]\nYeah I got really good deal for ten years actually night you're the one year caches HBO Showtime them ...\nNumber ... yeah you got to be it's all just got to pay attention to it so but what's the ... but now are you glad are you sorry what you said you had some issues\nWell one issue is the remote we got the fish and then I'll get I loved that removed that you can talk to by the way that\n... that is a nice feature yeah Comcast is working hard with the ex one system so we're to compete with you know really what is a threat to their business model which is people like you court cutters so they they they want to make sure they're offering something for that extra hundred twenty bucks\nAnyway the other day you know me from the Internet for every other day I woke up and no Internet\nConnection do you get all the little browser and wanted to activate right ... ... the cable right if you will not\nAfterward I have an air is a ... a surfboard sixty one forty one ... bucks history\nIs that is that that yours or that that one the Comcast provided you have your own yes\nIt's my job I like those era so here's what ... the way this all works uh the cable company sends us say say they spend a little signal down to the modem to activate it uh and you can I think you found that there is a website where you press a button and supposedly it does that\nWhere what you're going through and um it's kind of you know and just a pain you gotta keep going through it do you have do you write Harley says well no no no\nBut it's like that isn't it like your breath on my own personal highly um well I uh I don't know what else to do you know bad capacitors would have the same thing\nWas a problem for a while but I think those have been pretty much a solved\nAs well um [noise] boy I you know you ...\nUsually if the mother board has issues you know there's a perhaps the ram as not being seen you'll get posts codes you'll get beeps in booths but it sounds like you're not getting the power on self test you kind of it's freezing right at that point\nRight yeah and I don't you know off off the top of my head I don't have a good solution for you on that one anybody in the chat room or\nListening wants to call in and make some suggestions is not it's not posting I think because uh it's it's stopping at the post otherwise you'd get something you get you get sounds at least so\nIt didn't you know very little uh other trouble like a like log files or ... laws\nBy not getting a log files so there's nothing to look at [laughter] uh you you know I'd refreshed the bios or you know make sure maybe maybe it could be the bias got corrupted fact that's\nThat's that's a seems like a likelihood at this point in and that's remember that's stored in the sea ma she changed the batter but at the same mosses only apart that only clear as part of it the if the frame where itself is damaged that's actually a problem\nThat's the equivalent of you know that's scary thing when you're updating the from wearing a mother board and they say don't unplug it if you do\nSo and so it may be that that's that that's what's happened 'cause it sounds like that's not getting run that it's it's freelance by\nThe only thing I haven't done as maybe this re installed the ... and if you\nCan yeah I Would certainly try that\n[noise] All right well\nGood luck mutt yeah used to be I mean this is a fun thing to do as a hobby is to build a build your own computer and it's not hard in fact I think every uh every parents should make their child\nDo this on [noise]\nIt's not like rebuilding an engineer or something I mean you're not going to get your hands dirty or but it's a great way for a kid especially you know if your if your twelve year old says Thirteen year old says I Want a computer\nA great let's let's get your computer at first and I've I've seen parents is I Love this idea first let's choose all the parts you got to go out and do the research\nAnd to pick the parts that you want oh here's the budget here's how much you can spend you've got to figure it out that means they have to go online they have to read reviews they have to look at the figure out what parts are needed to make a computer great place to start is a PC Perspective P. C. P. E.

E. R. K. dot com and you know you it's pretty clear what's going on as soon as you go to a site like this\nYou're doing something you're seeing ads most of the time\nAnd if you do enough of that they make money because they can charge the advertiser and they send you some small amount it's kind of like if you have a cash back credit card right and you get one or two percent back well of course you get in one or two percent back as a credit card companies charging the merchant five percent they're giving you a little bit on the side they're making money too\nThat's a win win you know that's great doesn't cost you anything except maybe some time some attention\nSo it's important though to understand that if somebody wants something more than that if they ever ask you this is the classic con game and this is the this is the unfortunate thing is ... con games that worked in real life are now in a\nIn the Internet world and they're ... what's funny is that the same games\nThey're the same games they're just change the Nigerian prince scam things like that they've been going on for years in real world and now the Internet's just given them a whole bunch of new ways to play the game there's a wonderful book at a highly recommend are called the confidence game\nWhy we fall for it every time [laughter] by a a a wonderful woman named Maria ... Copa I've actually interviewed her on this game is a great book and it's about modern cons and their relationship to the old ...\n... is a fascinating person she's actually become a poker champion she's reading a new book about up high stakes poker in order to do that [laughter] [noise] she's a become a poker chance she's brilliant\nBrilliant but her book the confidence game is a great read if you want to kind of\nUnderstand I'm sure that's been excerpted magazines you could probably find it on what parts of it on line to understand these old games and how they're you know the pigeon drop games do you ever see the sting\nOr ... I Love I Love con men a lot of great movies and books about con man they're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new kind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general\nIf I were to generalize all of these games play on one thing your greed\nSomething for nothing so that's the that's\nThe alarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell\nIn general things like the pigeon drop require in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email sure you have a low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast\nAnd I need to help somebody in America\nI'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent\nBut if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever they're going to get money out of you so all of these ... games in the long run will take your money\nBut the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart\nAnd the the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful\nFun things into your home as we entered late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook and you love face but he did a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to\nSell ads\nThat's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google we get so much value out of things like Facebook Google Twitter Instagram they're all free\nBut but there's something there there's a way they're making money 'cause they're not free for the guys who run those companies as expensive so what are they making how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free\nBut [laughter] that's only because we have fabulous advertisers now I'm really careful we pick ads and advertisers that are products that use and like so I don't mind I'm happy to recommend like remote PC there's a good example\nHappy to remain recommend ... sees a wonderful tool very affordable you get great value for your dollar it allows you to access any computer a Mac or a PC\nWindows or Mac from anywhere using a Mac or a PC or even your\nMobile devices that's very handy I Do a lot of tech support for family and friends that lets me I put remote PC on their computer mind and then I can log into their computer I can change things I can move things around I could upload fixes download files it's awesome great if you have a home office and you leave stuff at work and you want to bring it home or vice versa [noise]\nNormally very affordable fast it's efficient it's secure and it's only about six dollars a month for up to ten computers but right now I've got a better deal and this makes it really worth a try it's one of the reason I'm happy to get these guys on our show if you use my namely or check out that's the ... eh Leo you'll get Ninety nine zero percent off the first year\nBasically these guys are so confident their product is fantastic any you will love it there practically giving it away for the first year\nPennies a month for the first year just just so that you try it knowing that you'll probably stick around and they have a new customer so take advantage of this find out using remote PC dot com is the offer code Leo Ninety percent off\nI we've never had an offer like that in my life if they called the Leo tech we can't special at remote PC dot com they all the port the tech guy [noise]\nTake a little time outs for more of our find sponsors make the show possum on we'll get back to work and that you read and\nListen to I hard radio get the free app W.

A. you and I asked ... doesn't have a proper titles and\nChris the glamour that in there that I Do not like I went through it all the pictures that apple is the flick or the other day I made sure they all titles just because he good yes\nYes I'm so it's yeah what are we looking at looking at a little tugboat all sorts um but it's not just a boat it has a face an ad on I have no idea\nWhy you see it or you just obviously you've never seen\nIt's probably a cultural a pop cultural relevance to something in the United yeah but I'm not aware of how it all hang engine it's a kids' show oh it's from Thomas the tank I think so yeah\nIt ... it does it does it it probably that means it doesn't it doesn't click with me as much as with anyone who you're always you're not from around here\nBut it's still clicked with me because it's a huge and one\nLook at face it's cute as a hat on so um I think it's a fun boat\nI like it the door to see there is but it anytime there's Texas the picture I just make that the name of the picture so there's that that's\nWhat I Do I'm you know that's that's that's the simplest thing you can do for a making\nTitles up your photos yeah think simple if Texas in a photo as you said make that title [noise] um if something simple is\nOn the photo something very clear is on the photo that's the subject of the photo then make that the title like ... in the next picture oh in Boulder and has a photo of a pink hats and he called a photo pain cats\nIf that simple out so it's a\nGood one too I this is this is a bold think this is a very big cat I liked it and there\nThere are several reasons why first of all this totally clear what this is about it's a pink had um the cat is in focus its biggest in the center so it's a relatively simple photo there is stuff going on in the background in like a reception of some sort of their people they are talking to each other but it's it's clear that the hat\nIs the thing that's that is is about because it's in focus and the rest of our focus [noise] um there's also a nice little color contrasting going on with the woman wearing a hat where's the green dress or at least there's some greening address a green red is a nice primary color contrast and you can see that had\nBeen kind of looks like it's like the windy so that gives its a motion with in the things that are on top I don't even know what you call those but stuff that's on hats you know [laughter] um yeah I like it ... it jumped at me because it's a crystal clear the colors of so bright and it\nWas just a little cheerful photo of a hat\nI like it to books like ... or something some event\nLooks looks like high class you\nKnow as a classy picture a class I'm like you and me who are wearing our says [laughter] I I think ... is a really classy high like fed\nI Love them and they're perfect for TV 'cause they have no brim so they don't block the light\nOutdoor cameras a nest it makes outdoor cameras I have to invest outdoor cameras that work quite well from a nest dot com and then I'm a ring also makes outdoor cameras have lights on them that can come on and so you can see everything that's going on all of them work at night so you're saying her camera\nShe is she's seeing what what is what is what is going wrong it's not recording it's not she's not seeing video what's going wrong\nSo for some reason it um I think the video was coming up it was a ... a long time ago some time last year that there was some kind of an air methods popping up\nAnd she pointed her mobile\nHonestly I Would just throw it all out\nOr try to sell it on ... and get a nest camp [noise]\nSo much cheaper I ... at any effort you spend any ... what does this guy going to cost you know to fix it it seems like a lot of work um and and frankly not as convenient solution the DVR solution is the old way of doing this just recording locally [noise]\nUm so I Would I honestly that's what I Would do there's a nest Kevin out during his campaign two hundred dollars\nHigh definition or does need why fi access because it's it's connected to the Internet via why fight in the ... has a website you can go and see what's going on at any time or you can see previous you you can get alerts on your smartphone instead of having a TV set up with a DVR she's using her phone I'm I'm a it's harvest\nAnd it diagnose what's going on with the cameras at this point because I don't really understand the question\nWell the thing is that she had a mobile app for it and I'm just like I don't know all the details to it but I'm basically the question is if I get the DVR replace\nAdult replaces the DVR and please [laughter] that's going to cost you so much money for a sub optimal solution I I think she's got a uh she should write the whole thing off\nA the camera records to a DVR via some cable that she's got attached to the cameras that comes into the business is that it\n[noise] yeah and it's all connected on it I mean her network I mean our home network and everything so she was able to heal it remotely [noise]\nAnd I just want to know is there some kind of like a like an app or we can have our own home set up and they will to view it they're like a certain apps without having to go through other services [noise]\nWell if you're going to do it on an app\nOver the Internet it's got to be stored somewhere [noise] um is there is is it a privacy concern or is it a costs concern [noise] all the above\nOkay [noise] um I think you could trust nest they're not looking at the video I'm the first costs a I think it's\nIt's considerably more Ford we've already spent more money on this thing than you will spend over you know five years on a mess [noise] ah the picture is going to be better I just don't know the brand that she has\nA I'm not sure he again what you\nKnow name yeah sure what you're trying to do you say you you ... the guy says well if you could tell me the error message I can fix it and she can't see the message because she's not seen the video is that the problem\nYeah because it has an age semi eight or ... hook up aged because that's how she used to have it connected to her old TV she gave her old TV to me sell because that you are without work any more I was getting I Am at the edge but now she wants to see what the era was\nAge she and my only connect it to her computer monitor and um you know just play so I'm thinking that might be something wrong with by age ...\nKind of fight just throw this thing out please [laughter] you're going to spend more money trying to figure out what's wrong and you're going to get a sub\nOptimal solution anyway and it's going to break again um there are so many companies that do this my recommendation would be to look at ... dot com ring dot com or they don't have outdoor cameras at a wise cam\nWhich is the least expensive but I've got these wise cans everywhere they're so inexpensive I actually have one pointing out a window it can it then it's indoor so that's okay but if she doesn't have a window I Would go to ... dot com\nGet a ... they have outdoor nest cameras that worked fabulously\nOr you can see what's going on at all times you'll get alerts on your smartphone you don't have a DVR because they store the video is so much better uh all ... as long as she's got why it'll work just fine and she needs somewhere to plug it in but obviously she's got that for the old system\nOr if you go to the wire cutter dot com and you look at their recommendations for the best outdoor security cameras they also say nest camp outdoor hundred sixty five dollars for the camera hundred sixty five dollars from Amazon that's\nYou know that's going to be less than ... than fixing that DVR and you can get multiple cameras if you want to ... uh two hundred eighty dollars on Amazon and then she pays the nest service I Can't remember what it is it's not not horribly expensive and it's great because well\nI'll give you an example we we're um we're in Japan or last spring and I was just looking at the camera see what's going on in the front yard and I saw my mailbox I have one of those rural mailboxes had been knocked over I thought oh man so I go back\nAnd I was able to find exactly what happened to a ... a car plowed into it did a little more research I have a doorbell camera from ring I was able to see the person coming getting out of the car ring or doorbell Oh nice she wanted to get it fixed I figured out who it was it was the\nWoman delivering newspapers next door and she was rolling up newspapers and she wasn't paying attention she planning her mailbox\nTalk\nTo her I said don't worry about it we wanted a new mailbox anyway but I have a complete record of that I Can't tell you how useful it is I have several outdoor cameras or we have outdoor cameras here as well at the studio\nAnd it's and it's not expensive and it's so much better so all of these old systems where you had the big old thing that looks like a ... a camcorder and the wiring and it's going into a DVR which is recording in looping over and over again all of this is completely\nObsolete uh I think it's just nutty just to just to\nPut any more money into it because I can guarantee is going to cost you more\nThan getting a a given that security camera hundred sixty five dollars a done you have to have wife by and you have to have power a you plug it in um is it was pretty easy to install you know takes takes submitted to install comes with all the screws and stuff the other one if you want lights the ring dot com they sell\n'em there and as I said they're spots of our podcasts they sell a flood light camera that has a camera in for like all these work at night or the ring you have a microphone and speaker and an alarm that you can bring you could talk to people if there's somebody outsiders store they because they get out of here your\nKids and that scares the heck out of [noise]\nHighly recommend well a port the tech guy

I don't know she didn't\nMention how many cameras they had on them but if you're talking like one of the DVR we're doing like a kid you know twelve cameras there you know as somebody who's been a liquor store you'd have like maybe twenty Garrett or something\nYeah that's a different story you're right that's expensive to do that with these ... consumer cameras\nBut yeah uh 'cause you have to pay for the storage for each camera that would really add up\nYeah I Would think so I was going to do cameras here would you recommend like the ... camera for that\nAre a lot of them I Love them yeah absolutely and that you know there's a subscription they give you a deal you should you should check to see how much it cost per camera a and you don't have to store you know you can store months worth of data or five days worth of data you get to choose\nAnd so that might be another thing to you know check the pricing on that but I think these are really good and and they're very high quality cameras\nUm there are cameras if you go to the wire cutter dot com and their review there are cameras that have no subscription fee or they don't store nearly as much but maybe you don't care right because\nUh maybe if anything happens if you have three days that's plenty yeah so that's another thing to look at work or if you look at their a security camera reviews talks about some that have no like the ... that\nThey don't unfortunately do an outdoor camera but the wise camps don't charge you for storage uh you're responsible for your own storage in effect on camera storage I'm the one that has no subscription ... circle to will only do twenty four hours of storage free so you just have to you know you have to care only about the last twenty four hours\nDo any of them have an opportunity for a door gunner on a device like a USB stick or yeah\nOr there's a memory the wise wise scams or an amazing deal W wise III there twenty and thirty dollars thirty dollars just for the pan tilt zoom you can control via the Internet they charge nothing for storage\n'em and they ... but you you if you want storage you put in a little micro S.

are you from are you familiar with Web design a yes I Am\nA know to get what ... what are the minimum ... there's all these different languages like where\nYou want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal\nI'm thinking about it they do something on the site so in the early\nDays of the Web\nA Web page and actually it's still true today when you actually look at the ... what they called the source code of the Web page a Web page is\nComposed of a couple of different things HTML which stands for hypertext markup language is the kind of the fundamental the route language of a website and it's it's markup language which means it's very simple it says this text should be bold this text\nShould be a Talib size this tech should be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML [noise]\nAh yes yes that was added later it stands for cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credible it in a way it's like a macro language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this font this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays a website is you want to separate the contents of the west\nSay from the display from the layout of the website and the early days we wished it altogether you'd have you know HTML tags\nFollowed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in the text editor we've gone way beyond that so modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nA CSS the style sheets still there and then the third and nowadays most important part is job a script almost all Web pages today use of programming language called job a script to do the fancier things animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learn to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those and then job\nScripted the ... is a true programming language that all Web browsers understand the job of script typically stored on the server as is the HTML CSS\nAnd the data and by the way the data's usually started a data base right that's things like the text\nThe links the images those are stored in a database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design a day you're probably going to be learning\nSomething called frameworks these our Web frameworks that help you design a interactive pages the most one of the most popular widely used it came from Facebook it's called react that's a job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script but you'll be using libraries from react\nTwitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because\nFor years java scripts was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will then it'd be interpreted as a java scripts something like closure you could do that with goer ... variety of other languages and then you don't have to write and java scripts but if you but you need to understand those fundamental technology so if you and your spare time you'd like to say yeah I think it would be ... by the way a great skill\nUh there's there's kind of three groups of things you need to do one is that programming thing java scripts CSS HTML you need to understand those\nThe other is the database you need to understand database design how you call databases how you interact with databases 'cause that's where the\nContent is stored and the third part and often these are different people doing this but if you really if you want to do a Web does if you want to become a Web designer and I have a little shop you know people hire you the third part is design\nYou need to learn design you needed to learn how to make a Web page look good had to make it usable I mean design includes not only how it looks but how people use it and we spent a court I'll give you an example here we spend a quarter of a million dollars\nFor my pod cast website which you can go look at AT T W. I. T.\nDot TV [noise] the company that designed this is in Austin they're called for kitchens they had a designer was a graphic specialist he helped choose the ... designed the logos the lay out things like that they had a programmer actually they had three or four programmers who did the job of script and the CSS [noise]\nThey have we have a database that is a\nBack and written in a an entirely different content management system you're going to hear this term a lot too and Web design C. M. S. called group all WordPress as a C. M. S. Google's blog spot as the ...\n... stores all the data in a might ask you will database delivers it it also offers a programmers interface which then the job of scripted can talk to to create a page\nThat the judge dodge job of scripted living on a server uh called her Roku that's where a lot of uh pages written and angular which is another Web framework live ah it's cashed on another server called red is\nWe use read his labs for that and the data itself is on a third server at black mesh\nThat's running group all and that's all to create one website\nSo you could see this very complex and very expensive uh and and big businesses are going to probably do this but it it the other way to go if you're interested in like maybe I Want to help [noise] maybe I Want to charge a restaurant down the street or my my local dry cleaner I Want to make a site for them\nThe other way to go is to become an expert in something like WordPress dot com", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Nashville", "day": "22"}
