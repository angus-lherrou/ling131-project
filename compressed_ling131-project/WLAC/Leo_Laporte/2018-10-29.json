well now that I'm finished a pick it up most of the hurricane yard trashed boy a I got a question\nAs I can now get back to being concerned about my computer yeah [noise] I'm looking for ... for an application or it will allow me to edit the ex F. meditate up all the photos oh yeah\nI went through a wicked petey is comparison tried all their suggestions and was not impressed with any of them\nYeah so I'm ... I'm willing to pay for a commercial applications but I just want one that will allow me to edit the copy\nOf the comments section you know this is I can so I can describe what the picture is and then be able to go search for certain key words you know in in the comments of the data\nFairly a simple thing to do all photos taken on cameras have something called an extended information tags their fields E. X. I. F. that whole things like the location data that's turned on date and time of capture\nStuff like that and there's an even further standard called I. P. T. see that as a comes from the wire agencies that can allow you to do even more data titles in ... and all sorts of stuff there's another uh\nYou know a ... there's other information in there besides just the photo like I see see information so all of this is a is great ah\nInformation and most photo library programs will automatically import that data and use it you could sort by day and so forth sometimes if you've got tags and there you can do searching\nI'm going to I don't know have you tried photo me\n[noise] a\nTry this one it's free so I like it it's from Germany and you know the Germans do good stuff\nWell if if I Would like to I went through ... and I cried about a dozen of them so I very well\nCould have his eye you might have it it's a fairly old one I haven't used it in a while but in fact I think I hate to say at\nThe ... in that might be for windows me which would be a terrible terrible thing [laughter] I don't know what I what I typically will do a is do it within light room 'cause that's what I used to process my photos and it has gives you access to all the ex if David alive\nI own light room I guess one of these days I'll have to learn how to use\nThat kind of a a ... a a Canada shoot a horse fly I [laughter] I don't think you need it just for acts of editing anybody in the chat room have a a a favored or exit editor I Would try this photo meets photo meat dot D. E.\n[noise] um I've also used [noise] I'm trying to remember I don't think I've used on windows it might be on the Mac but there are a number of programs that let you quickly import raw images because light room is very bad at a raw and I've used a program called fast\nRaw viewer and I'm pretty sure yes for windows as well now it's not free but I'm pretty sure fast raw viewer will also let you modify the uh the taxi ex if tax in there\nSo you can try before you buy it's fast raw viewer dot com and that is kept up to date that is a very up to date program\nAnd the reason I like it is because light room is so slow you know my raw photos on some of my cameras or forty two megabytes they're very very big files and so a premature so it takes a while for white women loaded and debris split fast reviewers designed to really get you to quickly go through your photos\nAnd uh and pick the ones you like but it also gives you full access to the P. T. C. and the access data so I think that would be even though it's not maybe this is the problem because that would keep you listing is specifically ex if editors but almost all good photo processing tools I think will also give you access to the exits information\nWell I guess I'm going to happen now break down by camera they only digital camera I got ... you\nKnow there's ... there's a look at J. pigs as well yeah it has batch anything of I. P. T. C. data one of the things I use this for is uh I like to put in to all the images I import from my camera I like to put in my name address\nYou know copyright information and stuff like that and this will do it in a batch format so you can have a standard kind of tanks that you put in try fast rub your you know I don't think you have to have raw files to to use it\nAnd it will let you do some sorting I Believe by tags by ah\nBy the tanks that you put into the access so that was one of the things you wanted to do that's another one too so there's ... there's the uh\nUh what was it going to have forgotten the name the Emmy program phone I mean is it I Can't remember now and the and then fast raw viewer photo me this photo me dot D. E. 'cause it's from Germany and fast raw viewer\nAnd anybody who has a suggestion you could call or you could put it in the chat room or you can go to the website tech guy labs dot com and added as a comment\nOr just you know you could just it's free to comment free to visit to say I have an answer for James\nI Know let's go to Rhode Island Chris is on the line hello Chris\n[noise] pay ... Rhode Island nice to see you welcome [laughter]\nIt's there before you get into it and and at first responders know how to do with the problem is there's so many different Android phones and the rules for how to do this very\nDepending on which the Android phone you have I think that is a big deal [noise] um I don't know if there's a standard way to do it anymore they're used to be on Android and are there in the early days\n[noise] uh [noise] you know I'm One way to do it in in you and you and you\nThis will depend very much um which Andrea they have Samsung's for instance have owner and owner info section\nThat when the phone is locked will scroll across the phone and at least that would give them some information or you can also in a Samsung phone update your profile and the contacts happen you'll notice there's medical information\nIn there and then you\nCan also a set ice emergency contacts I think that's their by default on Samsung phones\nSo you want to add that it's very important but but look at the lock screened message most if not all unfortunately many Android phones have a lock screen message and you could put information there if nothing else\nPut a a contact phone number because the as I said the first responders that's the thing they tell me that there and if you're a first responder\nUh let me know if I'm wrong on this but I've talked to a couple and they said look what we really wanted that emergency contact number so at the very least you know put that in your lock screen message you could say ice in a phone number and people will know what that means the first responders will know\nAnd if you don't have that feature the one last thing you can do and this is true on any phone you know you have a lock screen image the thing that shows up you can use it at a photo editor without lock screened image it puts them information they're\nNow remember everybody will be able to everybody will be able to see that\nBut ah so you you know consider that but uh almost ... almost ... screen imaging at the very least you could do you know in just if you do I see that in case of emergency people know what that means and then a phone number that's getting Ninety percent of the way there as long as that person was\n... I should just do my friends to get life oh\nYeah yeah this is something Apple's done really really well um [noise] I Wish every I don't you know Android the problem is Android is not unlike Iowa is not a unified ecosystem is lots of different Android phones and lots of different ways to do it [noise] so on the iPhone it's summer I\nWas somewhat I was at amusement park and the older culture and my phone started ringing so when I when I got off I went and looked at it and it was a local call I thought what made it as my hotel I better call it so I called and I get the police\nAnd they said we just had an emergency calls pretty small and wow I said oh my God\nNo I just had it in my pocket\nYou know I must have done it I'm so sorry Joe J.

virtual reality cat [noise] and the article describes cheaters Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles using virtual reality to treat chronic pain\nYeah [noise] and um [noise] so they they ... friends or a company in in Beverly Hills call VR 'em upside VR yeah\nThat has a package of a shame so package a virtual reality for about eight out of a problem is there's software [noise] a cost issue somewhere between Eighteen hundred and fifty thousand\nDollars geez isn't that a shame\n[noise] so [noise] I've spoken to several psychiatrist at UCLA to see if they know anything about it and I asked\nMy son who was a software developer and Austin if he knew anything about it and nobody seems to know and I'm In a battle shaping [noise] and I have you on the radio [laughter]\nI live ... maybe you can help why do we actually yeah I\nWill I Will put in the show notes a link to the an article from the national institutes of health uh of course the United states or you know and I ... a very reliable a trusted source and there's a paper here from a fairly recently um on virtual reality and\nPain management current trends and future directions that does describe because we don't really understand the mechanism why this would work but it's very much being studied and with some success and the question is what it is what's off or are they using how are they doing it and how does it work and this ah this this\nArticle I think you'll find a little more informative uh than the newspaper article about this um\nCalled the ... the use of it at least yeah it does is it occupies the mine is such a way it end at the same time transfer pain signals to the ... yeah [noise]\nSo they they they they mentioned in this uh in a scholarly paper that the number of an age funded studies investigating the use of E R for pain management has doubled\nOr this you know they're ... they're you know one of the techniques his bio feedback you know deep breathing with stuff that we know is already worked but using VR a or B R plus hypnosis VR plus breathing exercises seem to have some\nSome results I also have seen V. are used in treatment of Pete TST post traumatic stress disorder and that seems to also be a affective\nI you know I always would caution NPR's the hottest thing in technology today and so it always caution a little bit um you know when it's the the the flavor of the month that you know there's [noise]\nBut I does it is very interesting I I see the the uh the article that you're referring to\n'em and it's certainly a lot better than opioids and opioid addiction but you're right the getting getting getting that are getting that software is an interesting a challenge and\nMy guess is that none of these techniques work without a doctor present you know it's not something you could take home and and do 'em uh there's also an article\nOn plus a scholarly article um the impact of virtual reality and chronic pain that could put that in the show to a as well so there's there's a lot of studies on this and they sleep they seem to agree that it does help\nBut you know almost anything helps [laughter] I think if\nI if it's not just the flavor of the ... because they mention hunter Hofmann Lewis evidently a VR\nPioneer yeah a punch to study back in early two thousand years it's been going on for a while that's right\nSo it's it's been around and now it seems to be getting fined tune and with the uh concentration on on opiate deaths\nAnd the ... ... ... impacts that it's it's\nComing into regularly use including some other hospitals\nThe plus a article or the impact of virtual reality on the chronic pain or comes from I'm not sure where but they talk about the software that they are used in the study\nThe VR application is called cool with an exclamation mark is an interactive Journey Through a fully immersive three hundred and sixty degree virtual reality fantasy landscape trees hills snow scenes caves flames and offers offers\nThe speed is slow in constant cannot be manipulated by the participant there is ambient music delivered by the application through headphones or the music isn't so loud that the participants can hear the experimenter and they can still converse\nBut by traveling through the landscape at a constant speed\nAh participants noted a significant reduced reduction in I'm In pain so this is another another software program I I don't know where you would get these I'm sure that you mentioned the price and a lot of times these specialized programs are extremely expensive\nBut that doesn't sound like a particularly complicated

I Hope to one of the ... second\nMoments you'll get a lightning bolt\nI took ... uh no I took two hundred pictures or how to get this one so\nI uh filled up part of my card [laughter] wow and when I came when I came back I looked at the moment there was the one photo that worked out so that was\nThat was just I'm so happy because that is a photo that ... something that doesn't happen you know that doesn't happen it won't happen I Want to see something like that again in the rest of my life I'm\nPretty sure about that so every photographer I think has that one shot that was just perfect timing and what's good thing to remember is you had to take a lot of pictures to get that one I think that's off oh yeah but I Love it very nice\nOkay ... second one uh when I talk about is ... dot com slash zero to yeah and it's a picture of camels\nIn the desert in the sunrise then it it's it's a it's a silhouette and to the sun is just raising behind them between defeat of one of the camels there's clouds in the sky and it it's just this\nKind of a magical light and a magical moment [noise] and ah of course the things you have an influence over in a shock like this is\nThe time when you're there so we knew we knew when the sun rice would be a you have influence over your location from where did you shoot it so you have to make sure to to uh\nShoot this from Los Angles to to get a nice ... camels um you have influence over the focal length like how many millimeters to shoot I shot really wide angle because I wanted that that big sky in there you have influence over the exposure in this case I made it a a ... a silhouette so I\nChose the according exposure there's little star burst which\nYou know the when the sun gets these little this little star shape um you can do this by shooting with a very small aperture and the only thing you don't really have been twins overall camels people and where they are [laughter] or do you [laughter] I was ...\n... what did you tell them okay lead the camels this way I'm going to be there\nThe master boot record you want to pay repair the boot loader and windows will ... will do that for you it's an easy thing to do it a couple of ways to do it one would be to get into\nUh the uh\nUh ... windows recovery menu so while you're booting up ... eight in the recovery menu\nYou'll click on trouble shoot advanced options\nAnd get into the automatic repair menu and then there's a tool called boot wreck dot E.
