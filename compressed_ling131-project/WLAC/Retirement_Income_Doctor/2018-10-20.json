that a person's happiness relies not on one thing but it's rather\nA combination of financial personal and physical health fan because you're listening to the show today a mass drawn if I could do this but I feel like I can do whatever I Want to even though John Joe here's the deal\nDo one John has a great book it's a phenomenal book it's a fun read it's an easy read in the happy ever after a guide to fulfill in retirement and it talks about the financial balance of talks about personal ballots and it talks about physical ballots because if you think about it if you have a lot of money\nAnd you're good to go on retirement much your personal life and your physical life are not very good that's not a very fond retirement if you have great health no money that's not fun either\nIf you're in great health and a lot of money that's good but if your personal life is out of whack that's not good either it's about getting everything to work together and so that's kind of John looks at a little bit differently is not about how you how much money do you have\nCan you give it to me that's not what he's about he's about helping you come up with a plan and a strategy for retirement so if you like a topic of the book the happy ever after a guy to a fulfilling retirement\nAnd it's going to be unlike any financial book you've ever read I think it's really easy to understand you're going to be nodding your head at times I don't know if you're going to be hired men like John ... and you know when the greatest Ironman perform river right no no but you did did it was [laughter]\nBut the numbers six one five six five six zero zero nine\nAnd does John said it's an answering service 'cause it's Saturday drug users stuff you know starting to spend time with your family but just say hey I Would love to get a copy of the book to leave your information\nUm adult take care of that right\nAbsolutely absolutely years ago just won't budge six five six zero zero nine I'd be happy to send the markets\nThe time 'cause you're right it's a it's a truly wealthy life is about creating a balance in those three areas it's not about the most amount of money it's about you know figuring out what you love to do have enough energy to do it and then you are going to need some money so we've got to make sure make smart decisions with money but\nLet's go to a ... were you know the markets have been crazy\nAbsolutely crazy I'm looking at swings a yesterday that was an eight hundred points you set on October tenth that went down\nThat I think the past week I looked in the last four or five days the market is down nine percent ten percent and that wasn't even clone including the eight hundred point days was more than that I made a five hundred point day on that Thursday\nA flip past friday is the thought he started to bounce back up so we'll see how it see how it finishes but this volatility is something that uh as I get older and start looking at things and I know mark worry about the same age I'm you're a little bit older of course of course I might be a little better\nSo why is October historically been the most volatile month of the year is it because they knew that I was going to be born in November and so they wanted to get rid of all the turmoil before I came into the world I guess what they say but it is October I why is that is because we're coming out of summer people are now getting back into their normal routines and back to work and I don't know why why is October\nTypically you know in the ... year exactly right that you know you come out of the summer there's an old saying that used to say you know a cell in may and go away which typically meant you could sell everything come back in September October after October by it back up and you wouldn't have missed a thing now\nWith the way the markets are now and I think it's also because we have such a world economy\nWhere everything is a you know coming together and it's so easy to get access to information be can you can place a trade and have it go through in a second\nSo you know it just lends itself to this volatility and I think October also sticks around a lot because we go back to you know eighty seven where he had the big crash and you know that was happening in October\nYeah and it's really interesting because October is really it's known for volatility drawn but it's not known for crashes in a typical you're seeing them up markets go up and down they're bouncing around a little bit more and and maybe one of the reasons is because it says October is also about average in terms of its mundane returns\nAnd this is data going back to Nineteen fifty and it's because we're also you know it's the October Fifteen 'cause the last time to to take care of your taxes from the previous year if you you know pushed them off from from the spring when you're supposed to do it so there are things happening end of the year things getting ready maybe that's what also leads to volatility\nThat absolutely does for sure a lot a lot of things go on and you know we can't control it we can't stop but we can keep an eye on it and we can be aware of it but I also know that\nIn and looking at this mark and I started to say we're both of you know we're both in our fifties and starting to really um you know look towards the future to becomes more real when you're looking at your lump sum or you're a four O. one K. or your your life savings and you've got to tied to this crazy market\nUm I think as we get older I'll speak personally even as I'm getting older and we do a lot of safe money stuff but even as I'm getting older I'm saying that down like you know I don't know if we need as much money in the market\nAs we have because this roller coaster is crazy and I know and I've been doing this twenty five years so I I'm not telling you to sell I'm not telling you to jump I'm not I'm telling you to to hang in there but I'm also saying you know what as we get a little bit older\nIt's a rollercoaster ride that we don't necessarily have to take so we're looking at a person's planned or portfolio\nIf you only need four or five percent why are we trying to get seven eight nine\nYou know it's ridiculous because all it does is it puts you in emotional stress because when you see the market fall like that and you go and you know you look at different portfolios and\nYou know it's been a week and some of these portfolios now because we have different buckets that we place clients Monday and different buckets some I'm not trying to suggest that my clients of this because nobody has called me this past week okay aside from\nSay hello how's the family what's going on I Need this nobody is calling and saying oh my gosh I'm so afraid because the market fell that\nUh I'm not going to make it not because we set your plan up with different blankets and we have your income guaranteed and so there there's a sense of security with that\nBut still to see a drop like that in your portfolio to go you know what hey uh yeah how much did you lose this week well I lost fifty grand what would you lose well I lost a hundred\nI think as we get older and I am starting to feel it I'm like that is not some place that I Want to be very long\nAnd the other thing that I Want to stress is that the volatility\nDoesn't equate to returns alright and we've talked about this before people think that okay I've got to you know take more risks ... more money aside because that money will grow faster and better and I'll get a nine percent return\nWell if we equate that to dollars it doesn't necessarily make sense that so we're talking about volatility let me see if I can give a quick example um I Am I talking too much I feel like I've been on a ...\nNo no but I Will say this before you tell your little story here because I think it's important and and so if you have questions about you know\nIf you have money all on your four oh one K. the ideas don't have all your money in the four oh one K. role there all your money in the wall street world there all your money in the insurance for older all your money in the banking world or the real estate world don't have everything in one place it's got to be kind of separated out\nSo that you are safe if one of the area goes down your okay you've got other buckets and that's what John was talking about but I Want to say this\nJohn is that you are duly license do you work in the wall street world and you also work in the insurance world and when we get to retirement\nOur focus maybe from our twenties and thirties and maybe even our forties where it's all about grows we started getting into our fifties and sixties return during or thinking about how long this money going to last now we're looking at kind of safes strategies safe alternatives but it doesn't mean we need to bail out of the market because that is still the best place to get grows\nSo if you have questions about all this you want to sit down with John it's six one five\nSix five six zero zero nine nine there is no ... for the fireside chat with John is what I'm calling it because that's all it is it's a conversation you want to find out about the lifestyle maximize or which is financial balance personal balance a physical ballots and it's about being diverse fight in the right way for your situation\nIt's six one five six five six zero zero\nNine nine John David accords which on they've been an associates I mark LA glider with us today for retire fit and we're talking about market volatility because it certainly bounce up in October ... a month or that typically happens\nBut we know we're coming into a twenty Nineteen season what can happen there twenty Seventeen at no volatility John twenty Eighteen is kinda what happens when you have no volatility one year I mean the next year we're going to have some bumps along the way now we're story I I say you work in the wall street world and the insurance world so because I wanted to say that you're not against Wall Street\nBecause somebody just tuned in for the first time and going\nOh well he must be an insurance only guy will know he's ... an insurance\nBut we do we do it all we can get anything you want and the or the other thing that's important when you're you were talking about that we get paid I get paid my from\nCharges of a flat fee so we are fee based on that we're not commission driven we're not selling I can get any product you want any tool that you want only after we talk about what it is that you want for your future in your life\nWe can find anything for you and we make the same so it makes no difference to me what you pick but let me talk about about to another like we cleared that up um because this may be the most important thing I say all afternoon\nAnd it's really really important and I share this was clients that come in and I shared and these these workshops that we do but",
