rate because the government is no longer back in the bonds get like they have done in the past with the backing them they're just not buying by on the right they were correct\nSorry drop [noise]\nIt's go a nightly news and watch the ticker at the bottom of the TV show on the bottom of the new show\nAnd it up and down every day every week [noise] same thing as as the bonds stock market does well Basel increased their yields and that pushes rates down and we had a dog marketed bad right now the sudden you've got people pulled a mock money out of the stock market put into bonds\nThat hell so it's it's really a funny thing [noise] 'cause you almost have to hope for bad things happen in the world to really screw up with the stock market and get people to pull money out of stocks and put into bonds but we're going away deep and that kinda stuff but I mean it's it's one of those things of\nThat bonds I got thirty year you get a Thirty Years' war so it's going to take you Thirty years possibly the make this money back so you know the returns not as\nGood but it's but it's a solid fairly stable return that you're going to get back it just takes longer as opposed to the stock market where you could possibly try quicker [noise]\nMaking them make its investment it make a return quicker and and make more money faster to do that but it's more risky or to do that which is why they they kind of play off each other so much is is once a longer term safer investments with a lesser return\nAnd you put that in just like layman's terms real quick or for just anybody is listening to science or was that was\nGood but it was right and bring it back home real quick I\nFinally got him back for it [laughter]\n[noise] so you're listening to this\nAnd you're wondering okay what ... what do you Chris just say ultimately what he's saying in what I'm saying is\nIf you're out shopping for rates you could call me today you can call it on the bank tomorrow can you recall you call everybody in the same day and potentially get the exact same right but do you call today and and you call in the ... and you call later and he got all this change in the market from one data that you're going

the orders companies would lift all their interest rate on there and you'd go look at the paper and find out who had the best rates so you could uh shopping around from there\nThey are where they are much more careful when you see a low low right there just looks too good to be true line ... you're probably paying one two three points just to get that right [noise] so [noise]\nIt's not always as

in Pittsburgh calling it an absolute tragedy Pittsburgh Police spokesman Chris Todd Mary\nIt's interesting because certainly there are people that are going to retire like everybody else you know maybe they could they could be you know Medicare is going to kick in and sixty five I my pension is going to kick in and sixty five I think it's a great time to retire\nBut there are other people to go you know what I Am really worked hard and I think I've done enough that I can retire and I want to enjoy it a lot of times it will be people I have a friend of mine that retired at fifty five because\nHe's had cancer a couple of different times his dad passed away in his early sixties have cancer and he's like I don't know how much time I have left I'm retiring and so he did he was a schoolteacher so we had the pension you know and it was one of those things that he could do and he just is never going to live in a super extravagant lifestyle that's not him\nI mean but he can do what he wants to do and he still does some things for the school district so he still gets a little bit more money coming in\nBut he was able to do what he wants and enjoy whatever he's got left I I think he kind of a under sells himself and his future but but that's just me but the ideas what if you do want to retire sooner water some of the challenges John that that goes into\nYou know retirees say fifty five there it's different retired at fifty five sixty five because there's a lot of rules and regulations to get the retirement money\nWell let's talk about those but the big thing I Want to stress before we get too much further is its retirement doesn't have to be an age it doesn't have to be you know ... ... people are looking at as a destination and they want to get to that retirement [noise]\nMore often than not people will come in and sit down and we'll have conversations in and we'll look at their finances and we'll look at all their assets and we start talking about what their goals and dreams are and they start projecting out when I retire when I retire and you know they might be fifty five ... mark that's a great time that people come in is when they're in their fifties and they released\nYou know looking at what the future is going to hold because they want to get out of where they are\nIn after having a conversation with them you know I look and I go why are you wait until ... sixty for a while you wait until sixty two but um you can go right now so I don't want people to be constricted with just a age number just like you mentioned your buddy who was fifty five\nLet's look at what it is you want to do how much you have and can we make it happen and it may take and it's going to take a few changes probably a few you know modifications a in a few understanding of some of these things were going to talk about today so\nYeah so let's not touch on some of the rules of getting to a four O. one K. or getting to an IRA before the age of fifty nine and a half because that's that's kind of the one whole back and then there's another big question and that would be health care so we'll we'll touch on that as well but let's first start with some of the rules I mean\nIraq can't get to it until I'm fifty nine and a half four O. one K. sometimes I can before sometimes maybe\n... ... you are correct so if you're coming out of\nUm the employer sponsored plan so the four o one K for all three B a four fifty seven some of these things\nIf you sever employment after fifty five so if you're fifty five are older and you are still employed or not employed 'cause you're sobering unemployment but your if your money is still in the qualified planner inside that four O. one K. for all three B\nYou can take money out of that plan without any penalty you still have to pay tax on the money but you don't have that ten percent penalty\nIf we're looking at the IRA world and some of these uh you know different I Will just the traditional i._r._a.\nIt is fifty nine and a half we have to weigh two before we pulled money out of there without getting a tempers have penalty so the four oh one K. that is about the biggest advantage aside from a forced savings plan is being the biggest to bash before all and K [laughter]\nBut uh the allowing of money to come out of that plan inside the four oh one K. so they can they can take money out of fifty five and above\nYeah when you're no longer employed by that that uh we're basically so you basically the retired he got laid off there's a lot of I mean that\nThat happens does that happen often do you have many people that get laid off and then go you know what I think I could just go ahead and retire\nThey start to look at it they come in and they sit down I'm ... and we we start to look at some of their finances and we look at or something else you mentioned health care and we're going to touch on that the second because I Want to spend some time that as well [noise]\nUm because that used to be a real barrier before we had healthcare reform people were like well I gotta stay working because ... you know I'm you know unfortunately sometimes ... ... and one of the stories I think of as a couple that\nThey came in and they said you know we want to we want to retire but I Can't retire because my spouse has MS and I can't get health insurance well now we can so health health insurance and again I don't want to divert too much on that 'cause they'll cover it but\nYou know let's stick with the the IRA they go oh my gosh I can retire I can get healthcare I Can't afford to do this so what we look at inside the four oh one K. is a ... you were never strong proponents of leaving money inside the four o one K plan\nBecause if you roll that money out after you retire there's so many other places you can put that probably so many better options are ... should say more choices the of the University of choice when you get it out of the four o one K plan\nBut leave enough in there to maybe that supplies are supports your income for the next four or five years until we can get to the IRA or until we can get to some of your other assets that you know aren't going to have any penalties on them when we draw the money\nAnd that's really a by I think it it's it's a big decision but it's not something that I think just the average person could just do that can make and they just say well I'm going to pull money out of my four oh one K. are there I mean does it get a little complicated or not yes [laughter] that's what I was thinking there is a little bit more than just\nGoing okay I guess are no longer work I'm going to start pulling money from my four oh one K. and you do have to remember whether it's for all ... money and has not been taxed yet so every dollar you'd do pull out and use you are now adding onto your income tax cut following in her right\nExactly and it let me take a one story\nIs my uh is much much sister and so my sister lives in Dallas with her husband and he they they both worked for Walgreens and they've been with Walgreens forever and buy a sister's husband to his name is Blake\nBlake is wanting to retire forever right so everyone out forever but let's say the last ten years he's wanted to get out of there and it's been bad he has been fighting and claw and just to get through because he just wanted to retire so he said at fifty five I'm going to retire\nAnd then so I was always talking to him thinking that he had a pension or something that kicks in at fifty five in and he's like\nNo we don't we don't have a pension and fifty five we just have the four oh one K. and our savings well then you have my sister my sister is a very very very very very nervous person so she is a\nDeal anxious nervous\nOr wants to support Blake wants to support her husband and say yes let's retire but how the heck are we going to retire if you if you quit working at fifty five where's the money going to come from well he thought he could just pull the money out of the four oh one K. and we'll just live on the four oh one K. money and we're going to be fine well you could\nBut there's not enough there so it was a matter of us sitting down and really looking at OK\nWhat steps are you going to take where's the income going to come from how do we contact human resources and the four one K. companies to make sure this all get set up properly because one false move there one bad move there\nIs a life changing decision so the stress in the anxiety that comes with that decision uh needs to be considered and looked at it and I would just stress\n... give us a call I mean the phone number is six one five six five six zero zero nine nine if you're in that fifty year old ranged fifty five year old range you're considering retiring\nUh you're starting to really look at what the future holds in where you're going to be and how much do you need and where's the income going to come from\nYou need to give us a call at six one five six five six zero zero nine nine\nWill sit down go through a pleasant conversation Mart called it a fireside chat we won't be on our bathrobes but we'll have a nice fireside easy relaxing chat to see if it makes sense for us to to work together to help you to lay out the beginning what we call your lifestyle maximize are so again that number six one five\nSix five six zero zero nine nine\nDo you like the idea of retiring sooner maybe you do maybe you don't well if you do think about what what would it be like to retire in my fifties\nA that is what we're talking about today kind of an exciting topic of the question is can we realistically do it while we're talking about some of the challenges that some of the things you need to be aware of so we've got a lot more to get to stay with us this is retire fed what John maven which on navy and associate\nA match here to join our from what I can\nCome to your feeling that if I can kind of vaccinations you tell me what it will feeling you know we can tell him point\nYou have any kind of relationship if you are financially nightmares down and having a hard time even on that front damn how many ... because they weren't all about you and your family want you to get John ...\nSays the only person to building trying and trying to find find I think you're right here on Ninety nine and\n... ... ... ... how they find the time you're on Ninety nine five zero zero Ninety marrying many not only by doing that you can do anything about management and the un and even if you're not having any kind of [noise]\nYeah you know because that was his whole identity was getting young men are strong and ready to play football and winning football and all of that and then there was nothing left that was his whole life\nAnd what not you know I just thought of something because I think now there's a difference in some of these words and they may sound like nuances passion to me is a little bit different than identity\nAnd I think what you're talking about bear Bryant that was his passion so I'm not suggesting you leave your passion ever you know but if you put that passion down\nNow yeah you're you're it's like you're you're going out to the farm too it's like send them the dog to the magical farm you know what she doesn't come back from so we want to make sure that we're ... we're discovering your passion and so it bear Bryant had a great quote if you've ever\nDid you know it used to carry a note around in his pocket and they're not that you did not he had a note in his pocket that said see John David ... said call John ... after he said call John David it was basically just I'll just summarize 'cause I Know are running short on time in the segment but it was a\nThat he read it every single day we kept it in his wallet and was basically a noted that said uh the gist of it was\nMake sure that what you're doing today is what is purposeful passionate and exciting to you because you're exchanging a day of your life for it and I think you're right that was when he quit exchanging a day of his life first passion\nHe uh he passed away was which was said here so we're all about helping you find your passion to find your purpose make sure you have enough money to do it called us six one five six five six zero zero nine nine\nSo we're talking about the idea of retiring sooner one of the biggest areas that are really critical when it comes to retiring soon sooner rather than later and say you're retiring before the age of sixty five healthcare you got to have it and how are you going to do it that's our topic when we\nCome back stay with us this is retired federal John ... which on navy and associate\nLean back needed help getting around\nI became a giants fan and he got help but get the same\nI mean he needed help dealing with things like that to me ... personal shopper and financial manager\n... dad moved in with me until I became a Christian physical therapy and even\nWhen I got to take and can\nI can you know like on the wrong side has to play\n... I Know scale [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe understand many roles to play\nAnd to help we created an online caregiving resource center ... at a A R P dot org slash caregiving you can find resources to connect with the caregiving community\nTogether we can better care for ourselves and the ones we live\nWe go AARP dot org slash caregiving to learn more public service announcement ... by ... happy and the ad council and economic\nAlly for and\nWe were told nothing can be done and joined the final moments together\n\nThe among the both of those lives\nMuscles all related to\nFound\nThe heroin that\n... ... ... phone kid got on [noise]\n\nThis is retired fit I'm pleased to hear what John David of John ... says his job works the science and build a financial plan designed to focus on living at a fulfilling\nFor retirement and we're talking about not just one thing we're not talking just about finances we're also talking about personal health physical health we're talking about everything kind of working together because if you have money and you don't have health doesn't sound like a good retirement\nYou have health but you have no money let's not probably good either and then you have money and you have health but\nYou have no personal balance in your life there's no really good thing that you know I mean it all goes together in and the idea is to try to get everything on the same page going in the same direction you wrote a boat in the same direction so that's kind of what we're talking about today are we are talking about the idea of retiring sooner some of the challenges at that poses\nAnd if you'd like sit down with John Kennedy to find out a little bit more about where you are in your road to retirement six one five six five six zero zero nine nine no cost normally Geisha no pressure to sit down with John six one five six five six\nZero zero nine nine one of the biggest hurdles to that decision of I'm going to retire at fifty five for example or I'm going to retire at sixty\nIs certainly Social Security has kicked in yet so we'll talk will touch on that here and just a bit as well but health care Medicare doesn't kick in until sixty five\nCan you still keep some insurance at work even though you're retired there is all that's a big part of this equation of being able to retire sooner rather than later would be the health care aspect isn't it\nIt is yeah and uh you know we've had this health care reform going on for the last eight years and we're not sure what Trump is going to do with with unraveling and I'd always be talked about unraveling at the gym shirts unraveled\nA or it is on rebel just to some extent and so it's a constant question that we're always asked and I have been a strong proponent and I'm going politically here but my youngest daughter Julia is a diabetic and she's been diabetic says she was four\nAnd so when the the healthcare reform came about um [noise]\nIt really was a big positive change not only for my daughter but it was a positive change for a lot of people that we talk to because\nYou know what's with my daughter being diabetic finding health insurance we had to stay on group plans or you know we couldn't go into our own individual planned\nUm because we we couldn't get coverage a lot of people that we're we're talking with that come in for retirement face that same challenge because somebody has a\nIllness or something happened where\nTraditionally before the health care reform and they made health insurance all guaranteed issue so no health insurance has all guaranteed issue so anybody can get health insurance anywhere whether it's through the exchange which again is not our area and I'm not a hundred percent familiar with it\nBut you can go to any carrier and get health insurance is guaranteed issue that doesn't mean the price is you know favorable but we do we can get coverage so if you have\nSomeone in your family that you're going okay I don't I you know we have the means to retire I can afford to retire\nBut it's just this health insurance we won't get health a church you can now get health insurance so that was a huge deal for my my diabetic daughter because we couldn't get health insurance but now she is covered and she always was covered but she can get covered under an individual plan versus\nGroup plan so I just want to stress the folks that we can do it we got a budget it\nI also hear sometimes a price wise people come in and they go oh my gosh it's cost a fortune to buy health insurance you know it's going to cost me two thousand dollars a month ago I was talking to my neighbor and my neighbor said\nNo it it it's not always that expensive and then we've got resources and people that we can help get your health insurance so a critical component for sure we do need the coverage because Medicare doesn't kick in sixty five\nBut isn't that that's one of the challenges because sometimes you can leave and and your employment will still allow you that what's that yelled when they\nAre we can cobra ... for Eighteen months if the employers big enough I think you need but more than fifty employees are I Know they can get very expensive though yes Colbert and get expensive but you can also you don't have to stay on that plan because now they have that portability law where you can move from your group sponsored plan\nAnd doing it is an individual plan and there is no longer preexisting conditions\nSo they have to take\nAnd it just depends on the planes are coming from\nYou know what your cost will be or what your your benefits will be in that way but\nThis is probably one of the biggest expenses that you will have isn't it\nYes yes it will so to get to be expensive for sure especially if you get to age six so really what you're\nSaying is just let the ... you're saying if you find somebody that you know so you can have the coverage I'm saying just\nRoll the dice come on there's nothing you got to be fixed [laughter]\nSo mark is not the one that you want to call you have if you're going to retire because if you roll the dice do not listen to that if you roll the dice now whether you're jeopardizing you're jeopardizing\nA basically everything on one because you I mean one bad health they could wipe out your\nTime you know and it's really it really is amazing because I Do think that the health care and I think it's one of the challenges and I know that's one of the areas that you will talk about in the lifestyle maximize or\nYou know when when people come in and you're going to talk about income planning on going to talk about investment planning on and talking about tax planning here and talk about health and long term care legacy an estate planning because all of that is part of the lifestyle maximize er and it's the well rounded you know the the physical the financial the personal all of that and working together\nBut at the end of the day when you think about something happening most of us don't think last never going to happen to me you know you drive by a car wreck on the ... that's crazy I Can't believe that just happened right over there was never going to happen to me well I've got a friend that is fifty six years of age", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement Income Doctor", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
