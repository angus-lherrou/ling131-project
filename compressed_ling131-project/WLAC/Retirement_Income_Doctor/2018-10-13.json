your tax returns because on your tax returns your show and all your income all your expenses and as a self employed individual you have the ability to ride off\nA lot of your income to reduce your tax liability so you oh hardly anything or you get a tax refund back at the end of the year\nWhere the W. person they've got to put all their numbers into the box into the equation and it's it's a boom this what you get [noise] and self employed you can pay zero taxes zero dollars in taxes 'cause you show zero dollars in income\nSo what happens when you you ah change jobs like say too much for trying to buy a house that you have to there's a certain amount of history you knees and before you get Malone my\nIf you're W too and you're going you know same same industry you just took a better job or or even a similar job and your pays the same as long sterile be too it's no big deal and I want to waste a lot to weigh like six months or something to them or not not unless there's something unique going on there are situations\nTimes where that might come up a a problem but I mean the big issues when you're going to be too self employed or because now you got no way of approving what your income is until you file your taxes identity\nAnd I can't tell you how many times I've seen pianos profit and loss statements that show exactly how much is being distributed in every bucket and so forth but then you come back and you see that tax return for the following year or for that year later\nAnd you're like you know you know when we did this loan back you know last year for you and all this stuff was shown over here and you're showing making Fifteen twenty grand a month but then your tax return shows you making five grand a month mhm\nYeah that's that's why they make you wait [noise] that's why they make you file your taxes and it's it's not [noise] I don't want to say it's not fair but yet\nIt is in some regard [noise] um but I mean it it just it sucks when you have to tell somebody at some point you can get a loan right now but there's a lot of ways that were able to make that work [noise] so if you listen to this and the are self employed [noise]\nDon't take this as you\nDebbie Downer or doomsday whatever you know it's it's not as bad as it may sound and again just call us because we can get around a lot of people say you got to have two years history of self employed we can get around with just one of your self employed um history of income and so forth but if you're gonna make any kind of change\nColor before you do it [noise] talk to us before you make the change or even if it's something as simple as like Jimmy was saying put in cash deposit into your cat it just creates all these different questions and hurdles that you don't want to jump through [noise]\nYou got anything to add to that [noise]\nNow other than a high stress to people if you were listening to a bad thing you are thinking of buying or selling or refinancing please call someone a column lender color realtor call someone in this\nDay and asked the question [noise] you'll save yourself a lot of heartache a lot of stress on the process a whole lot of our air or even make yourself feel a lot mayor and me like I didn't realize I was in such a great position yeah I mean get rid of the latter day Saint Louis\nAbsolutely [noise] hey we got around but even listen to the money I might show here on TALK radio for things in the ... the checks on line and let them in the net for on Facebook and money man like radio every day

charges about Ninety minutes from now Bronson is scheduled to meet with President Trump inside the oval office [noise] [noise]\n... and I think it's I think that you big factors mark our income or and or money so we ... we need to have the income and we need to have the money so people were are looking at this um you know like you're talking to sixty two are sixty five\nBut if if they've got plenty of money I mean during an income stream and that income stream comes into replaces their their job W do business owner paycheck however they're taking their resources well then they can get out and they can retire the second thing I think that's making it easier now is healthcare\nSo you know it used to be this age I gotta go sixty two are sixty five because I got to get Medicare\nOr to kick it at sixty five and paid for by a you know the health care that that we need\nNow with the the implementation of guaranteed insurance so now\nIt is guaranteed you can step out regardless of health and get healthcare coverage whether that's through the healthcare reform or if it is now any carrier on the market and I think we're going to see that environment change do in the future now that's not cheap knows that you've got to have money but you know it all comes back to money so we're talking about in ages a number of the people shoot for\nBut if you have the resources in now again was it easier being healthcare we can we can step out of the workforce earlier and I think a lot of people don't really\nBut is that they can do that and it's it is not cheap but it it it some cases it's not as expensive as people think\nSo if you have questions about hey can I retire that's that's always the number one question I can I retire or six one five six five six zero zero nine nine to sit down with John and the team of John David and associates what would you call this kind of a ... story\nYup or you called it a fireside chat so I had this vision of you sitting in a bathroom with a a sister sniffed are full of brandy in near cigar or your pipe going hey let's say the\nFireside chat and just discuss it it really it is it's a it's an opportunity for us both to sit down to say you know what\nHe these are the things that concern me about retirement a and we'd go through a myriad of of different uh thoughts ideas concept goals et cetera and then I talk about you know am I the guy that possibly be helped steer your lead you in that direction so it's a very very non threatening\nEasy fireside chat if you will just to uh to get to know each other and see if it makes sense\nSo number again as six one five six five six zero zero nine nine I Mark Kelly and John David what John David and associates John has been in the business now for since well since Nineteen Ninety three and we're talking about some challenges to\nAnd and really some challenges to why you may not retire on time while you might be able to retire earlier than you thought you could there's a lot that goes into this\nAnd so you know a lot of people get caught up John and the number hey I Need a million dollars well I mean you have people that they can't retire on a million dollars and you have people that can probably retire on two hundred thousand\nEverything is is really depends on the individual or the couple you're sitting down with when it comes to that but we do all have a number I suppose it's just different for everybody\n... and uh you know when it comes to that income number when you were looking at\nAsking that question how do you figure out what your income number is is this the the and he said what is the number and that is the the question so I'm trying to go okay if I were a consumer how would I figure this out and would like to do markets tell people\nUh you know when we sit down at this this fire such as we look at them and go on and so what is your income number and people often look at me and they go I don't really know what you mean and I say okay well\nThat's a fair question because again they they don't know what the number is so high you hear different experts say you need a million dollars you need ... to replace eighty percent of your working income\nI'm a firm believer that you need to replace a hundred percent of your net income\nAnd so when I share that they they look at me and go okay what ... what do you mean\nUm because it did is confusing all these different numbers get thrown about and if it's not the world that you typically operate and people aren't familiar is what the number might be so\nI Would look at the number on the bottom of your pay check every single week or two weeks however you get paid so if you're looking at it from a standpoint of okay\nI take home or you know three thousand dollars every two weeks my wife takes home two thousand dollars every two weeks\nSo you're basically living on ten thousand dollars a month\nAnd so is that where your number is that your net number that's what your number and if you're living on that now I Would say too that's another caviar if we're if we're making it on that number at home and live in a great life and living a life you want to live on that number that your net number that makes sense\nYeah the net and up and what what's your take home or not what your your annual salary is it I guess what you're getting to take home survive so he never it's because it's different because the taxes\nPeople sit down and they say okay well John I make a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year and I go okay that's great fantastic but what do you take home and they're like oh hey what do you mean like what do you what do you take home and your paycheck because when you retire\nTheoretically taxes should go down right you're not going to have the four oh one K. coming out of your paycheck you're not going to have the uh the essay or the ... just say the health savings account come out you know there's probably a little bit of money that comes out of your paycheck for your life insurance deduction that you get through work\nI'm there could be something you know people have like Christmas clubs or they have these different uh\nThings that come out of the paycheck you know for for savings for example all that stuff is not coming out so it's really that net number of you're living on\nWhatever it is five thousand ten thousand dollars a month that we want to make sure we can replace but that's scary too a lot of people who don't do this every single day because the question becomes him I got to have enough money\nAm I going to be able to sustain my lifestyle and then the second question I often get his where's it going to come from so hey we've got to figure out that income number and make sure we hold on and on that and we create a strategy to get that and replace that income number 'cause if you don't replace the income number like you mentioned at the start of the show it's gonna be a\nBad retirement so we want to make sure we replaced the income number and then yeah where's that going to come from so yeah we're we're talking\n... if we replace this income number and they have a plan for replacing the income number and we know what that number is it doesn't have to be scary and I don't want it to be scary I Want people to come in and feel comfortable\nSaying okay I Know what my number is a I Need help to figure out what that is and I get that a lot as well so how do I even figure out what it is and will walk you through that\nThen we have to then say okay let's create a great strategy and we use something called the lifestyle maximize or I Know we're going to talk about that as the show goes on but the lifestyle maximize there's this one of the tools that we use to help people uh it's our customs tool\nIt helps you create a custom plan so that you can feel confident when you step out the you know your income is going to be replaced and you have the right number to make sure you could live a great retirement\nAnd I would you suggest folks if if you want to give us a call at six one five six five six\nZero zero nine nine\nCome on sit down do the fireside chat so when you called six one five six

awful lot that goes into retirement planning for a pre retiree and the fact of the matter is is that you have the build up you're ready to retire but something happens and you just don't do it you're not really sure you can so you don't you put it off well that's what we're talking about today how do you know you can retire there's a lot\nThat goes into that and we've got a lot more to get to stay

I. lazy\n[noise]\nFederal John John maven and associates I'm Mark Kelly is you know John believes that a person's happiness relies not on one thing but rather a combination\nOf financial personal and physical health it all goes together and living out their retirement of your dreams if you have questions about any of this at six one five six five six zero zero nine nine to sit down with John for that fireside chat no cost obligation no pressure for this visit\nSix one five six five six zero zero nine nine it's going to find out more about John you can certainly go to his website ... dot com it's John with an H named to be as an victory John maven dot com or talking about how do you go about picking your retirement date\nIs it by ages of my income well it's really kind of a combination but you certainly need to make sure that the income is going to be fine because you're now involuntary unemployment when you quit working so can you replace those paychecks and still do the things that you want to do and keep up with the bills and all of that but it's really about doing some fun stuff to when you get to retirement\nSo John at the end of the last say my we we've covered a lot of ground so far but you brought up a lot of the what is what is myself or my spouse has a health issue\nHow does that factor into our retirement plan you know there are so many different areas inflation market volatility\nOr interest rates going up how does that affect who I've got a lot of money in bonds right now because I think they're safe await interest rates go up bond values go down I mean all of these kind of what if things scenarios are certainly things that you talk with with your clients about right it's not always going to be perfectly gold paved roads perfectly smooth the rest of our lives you\nKnow we've got we've got to create that the plan first um\nYou know and and make sure that that we look at what some of these risks may be because you know just as you mentioned just those three or four things that you just mentioned between bonds and you know health uh my spouse and if I were and I was I was sitting here mark when you were talking about it and I'm like holy\nCrap I'm not retired [laughter] you know I Can't cover all those things how am I going to cover all this stuff and then it becomes too overwhelming\nAnd what do we do we go back to crush the nation but you can overcome all of those things and you can create strategies again to say okay what could be the worst thing that happens for for example when\nI was sitting with them and they'll just over the past twenty five years if there are a lot of people say uh okay I Can't retire because they don't have enough income or I don't know where it's going to come from or what if this happens\nAnd so when we create the different ah I call them buckets because I think buckets or a term that most everybody can can relate to recreate for different buckets that we treat or\nSavings bucket income bucket a short term bucket and a long term bucket each one of the buckets contain different sums of money they also contain different vehicles that we would invested so when somebody comes in as it sounds as okay well\nWhat if uh I get sick or what if um you know I Need to replace the root for what if the furnace breaks\nAll these things are ideas that we talk through and we can help people uncovered like the the tax issue what if what if taxes go up what are we going to do there what if um you mentioned my my wife gets sick\nWe can cover all these things and we do cover all of them and we have a plan for him so whether it's covered by insurance or it's covered by keeping more money in your safe bucket or it's covered by\nJust you know created a plan that has something in place for inflation all of these things can can be covered so I don't want people feel overwhelmed I guess it's probably the big thing\nIs yeah and that's certainly ... that's the heart of it though I mean yeah have you back to our procrastination you know their holy cow what if that happens what about it I'm never going to retire because I don't know what's gonna happen I Need to make sure that we're okay and that's really the idea of of making the phone call to sit down with you I think is let's find out where you are\nAnd then see if we need to make some tweaks here there to allow you to retire and live out your hopes and dreams because it really does come down to the vision that your clients have for their retirement\nWhen you're putting that plan together it's not all about the the money it's not all about what are you know what what kind of challenges might be out there it's also about what do you want to do\nWhat do you want to do and it you know it's emotional you talked about this is that going to go this is all very very emotional whether it's ... for you or it is fear it's all emotional so you knew that was very insightful\nMark I live there was you know it is interesting though because there are\nYou know thinking about it you you've been on the financial world since Nineteen Ninety three\nNow you have a lot of other interest you love going on the bike ride across Montana and doing all of these things that are that are out going in putting you in better shape and conditioning and all of that you're being into outdoor living basically\nSo you know that that's part of you but you also know that John David associates is part of you as well you've had a company for a long time and one of the challenges when you retire I Would think I have a buddy of mine that I used to work in a radio station he was a general manager we go play golf a lot and we were four years after he'd worked for a sea change jobs\nAnd they would say you know when you're playing with a group of guys you don't really know hey what do you do and he would say well I used to be the general manager at the radio station that that mark works at\nAnd I'm like why are you still on that three years later when that's not what you do but that's\nHow we may invasion himself as the general manager of a radio station he thought that had more or maybe more I carry a little more weight with the people were playing with and what he was doing at the time and so we do get caught up some times in our job is our identity don't win\nYes we do and that's just really a role so we've got we've got to get away from that for sure because\nWe want to look and go okay what is it that you want to do so we talked about income we talked about you know a little bit about emotions and procrastination but we really got to look and say and make this comfortable we talked about a fireside chat\nUm but I Would suggest to if if you're married um you have a fireside chat with your spouse and I I think that we get so busy and so caught up with all these or other things in activities that we don't ever say okay what is it that we really want to do and I don't want people like okay\nYou know if I was just like you mentioned if I leave my job well then that's that's my whole identity no\nThat's just one thing that you did throughout your life now we're going to go on to something else but I Want to make sure that you do more of this stuff that you love to do you mentioned um your bike and across Montana and um you know doing Iron Man races in ... and some of these other things that", "year": "2018",
