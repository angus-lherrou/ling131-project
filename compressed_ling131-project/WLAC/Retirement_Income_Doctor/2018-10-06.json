{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Absolutely heads exactly what we did with one of our clients just a a last week where we initially set out to close a shirt location and then it's like wait a minute he lives out in Murfreesboro let's just close in Murfreesboro Tenn early within thirty minutes one email boom done\nCertainly no problem we uh we we ... we move close loans and pretty much about anywhere but you know traffic gets busy around town and people getting busier\nIt becomes harder and harder for people to get the closings now as we've talked before come July of two thousand and night to electronic I notary so maybe you can just do it from home and your bathrobe I don't know but until then we look forward to seeing you at a\nAt our offices they are yeah heck yeah so what's what is ... what am I not paying or what am I saying or what am I what am I saving money on here what are we\nMan let's let's set up a first defined what PM I as people here that's P. M. I. M. I. more of an insurer might be it might be it's all the same thing and Freddie Mac defines ... area my as an insurance policy that protects the lender\nIf you use the homeowner unable to pay your mortgage it's a monthly fee to throw it into your mortgage payment that is required for all conforming conventional loans and at the ha that have less than twenty percent down payment\nThen once you have ... percent equity in your home you can see your M. I. P. or ... whatever you want to call it and remove the expense from your mortgage payment however if you have an essay Che mortgage\nIt is on there for life unless you purchase live alone by federal law yeah it's not your life yeah not our life or your life is a homeowner I'm some of the older more an effigy mortgages um [noise] had a five year cancellation them but everything that's new everything that's been originated in the last couple of years\nIs subject to the lifetime in my requirement until you paid alone off\nSo that is am I and\nI always tell people at closings I said it's if if you default on your note that that in the lender comes in legally takes the house back from you for the collateral from you which is called the foreclosure process the lender will go to the insurance company up and they will cash in their insurance policy that says this guy didn't pay\nA please give me my money and so what happens is you no longer have a problem with the mortgage company you know you have a problem with the mortgage insurance company who settled with the fact of trying to collect that data from you or any deficiency between what the house sold at at a foreclosure and what you owe the bank\nBack yet this summer as what he just said you don't want to do that you're even going yeah ... you don't want any part of it\nUm I mean it's to me and I tell clients of maybe talk to me on the phone talking about the mortgage I Will fly I'll tell you you don't want to pay more of a difference it is a waste of money it's a necessary evil that you have to deal with [laughter] so why are buying\nSomething for the protection of the lender because you you may not have the entire twenty percent dump a ... so the only person that benefits from mortgage insurance is the more insurance company that Linder yeah\nNow why am I now saying the cost of not paying mortgage insurance\nBecause that is a sharp contrast to what I normally say [laughter] and normally preach and here's the deal\nFor people do pay it because they don't have a twenty percent down payment that that doesn't stop people from getting a loan they still can get alone you know but they just may be subject to the private mortgage insurance so I Want to say that\nNo that's exactly and that's exactly where I wanted to go with this because a lot of people are still the fun of but that's OK many people think why can't buy a house unless I have twenty percent\nWell no that's not correct because that's where the ... the mortgage insurance comes into into effect to help you put down as little as three percent five percent and in some cases we can do zero percent you know there's there's a lot of options so that's when pain PM I or mortgage insurance\nIs a good thing because think about it from this point of view\nIf and we talked about this throughout all the today show\nWith the way properties are ... appreciating year over year over year you buy a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house today and use the appreciation of six percent through the next five years that houses now worse nearly three hundred thousand dollars\nAll right then you turn around and look at the mortgage insurance on it and over that same five year period [noise] you're gonna pay sixty six hundred dollars a mortgage insurance\nSo you just games fifty thousand dollars in equity through appreciation\nSubtract out the sixty six hundred bucks and mortgage insurance that helped you participate and being a homeowner and she'd taken you know taking control that uh appreciation instead of paying rent to somebody else so they're probably can appreciate instead of yours and you've just let it out forty three thousand dollars\nWill be much yeah I mean it's it's printing money for yourself and don't don't forget about the fact every month to make a payment\nYou're paying yourself because you're paying down the principal every single month whereas when you're renting you're given that entire check to your landlord to pay their mortgage and the pay their principal down you don't get any credit from your rent whereas you write your Thirteen hundred bucks for sixteen hundred or two thousand dollars a month [laughter]\nPart of that goes to paint on your principles we're moving the money from your left your right pocket to your left pocket essentially and you're forced savings so\nA couple of things come to mind [noise] you guys can get a little creative would have mortgage insurance works right wing it very creative with it [noise] so I mean meaning like sometimes you can pre pay it can be pre paid to where it's not built into the monthly payments\n... we can that's called single a mind to where you have no monthly him my cost cannot even built into the payments it's not built into the payment all increase your clothes and costs just a tad but yet when you run the numbers and let me tell you if you can read your bank statement every month you can see these numbers I'm going to be able to give me an single in my versus monthly am I\nAnd be like ... that makes a whole lot more sense to go see a lot of mine\nAnd sometimes you can ... can be done with it you can have the lender ... right yeah so there's a lot of options other than just saying hey one box that's all you fit in here and here's your version of mortgage insurance\nPremium now mortgage insurance costs wise is is kind of a moving target a little bit in it and I mean depending on what are some of those factors that that affects what pricing cost on that\nCredit score your ... your amount that you put down your debt to income ratio and literally it's ... it's the exact same way that we price out\nA conventional loan it looks at all the same uh ... adjustments and it prices ... led does exact same thing but what a mortgage insurance premium right you pay for so the higher your score below or the ... and as your score starts to drop [noise] then it starts to become a game of where\nIt might be cheaper for you to go with an F. ha loan because the ... in my is one set premium across the board regardless what your credit score so\nThat's what we do in sin in helping to advise you but this is also why I can tell you if you're out there just re shopping and you're looking for the lowest cheapest possible raped\nAnd you've got a you know good credit score\nYou're going the wrong direction because you may put yourself into an effigy a mortgage because F ha rates are cheaper to conventional writes there historically a quarter to half a point cheaper everyday but yet if you're just focus on just that rate\nAnd not the actual monthly payment you are going to pay every month I can sit there and show your conventional loan that blows away your\nEssay Che payment even though the conventional retire\nA point in time where as I say mortgage and ... what you if you had an F ha loan and Morgan insurance you could get it removed from the loan they change that there was All right this there was a point in time so many some folks maybe thinking while I thought that that would come all at one time reached twenty percent so there was a point in time when that would happen\nBut when but once the recession going to happen\nAnd if I tell you about them in Bay shore up against the way to explain that they felt that they had to continue the bump up its reserves and by doing that they are required to get the mortgage insurance for the duration of alone now if you wanted to get rid of that and get an F ha loan what what people recourse be\nJust refinance so they'd have to refinance and so even if they had cost associated with a ... which I Know water stoned could probably do zero coffee and finance but people as well so you could almost to zero cost refinance get out of the mortgage insurance premium if he actually was there and then you're saving a bunch of money in\nYour in your pocket where there's so much more we need to talk about this and we're gonna pick up on I'm going to next show [laughter] because I mean there's I mean I don't have enough time Jimmy scenario telling me that I got to go see them as I look\nWe'll pick this up more next show the costs of paying PM in my mind why you want to do it unless the money man my show here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and W. L. A. F. Fifteen tend to be like the ... were\nThe want to get elected broadcast that this is talk radio not boy three on tell me what I say see the fifteenth and W.\nNashville\nWaiting a final vote on ham who's now Fox News in just a few hours the Senate is expected to confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court Jeff Fox is Janet how far is live on Capitol Hill\nHe has the votes but opponents of Brett Kavanaugh are not letting up [noise]\nYou have people that can retire before they're sixty because they've got they've done a wonderful job they've got the money they need but it really is a two prong question probably it's not just\nAge it's also income is what I guess I mean you know sort of my friends are going John I'm gonna retire because I've got the Social Security companies sixty two I'm got Medicare coming at sixty five I'm retiring then and then you I'm thinking well have you looked at all the income that you need another side of this right among isn't just age\nAnd I think it's I think that you big factors mark our income or and or money so we do we need to have the income and we need to have the money so people were are looking at this um you know like you're talking to sixty two are sixty five\nBut if if they've got plenty of money and wing drain and income stream and they didn't give us dream comes into replaces their their job W do business owner paycheck however they're taking their resources well then they can get out and they can retire the second thing I think that's making it easier now is healthcare\nSo you know it used to be this age I gotta go sixty two are sixty five 'cause I got to get Medicare\nOr to kick it sixty five and paid for by a you know the healthcare that that we need\nNow with the the implementation of guaranteed insurance so now it is guaranteed you can step out regardless of health and get a healthcare coverage whether this\nDrew the healthcare reform or if it is now any carrier on the market and I think we're going to see that environment change do in the future now that's not cheap knows that she got to have money [laughter] you know it all comes back to money so we're talking about in ages a number of the people shoot for\nBut if you have the resources have now again with an easier being healthcare we can we can step out of the workforce earlier and I think a lot of people don't\nRealize that they can do that and it's it is not cheap but it it it some cases it's not as expensive as people think\nSo if you have questions about hey can I retire that's that's always the number one question I can I retire or six one five six five six zero zero nine nine to sit down with John and a team of John David and associates\nWhat would you call this kind of a you called or a story\nYup or you called it a fireside chat so I had this vision of you sitting in a bathroom with a a sister sniffed are full of brandy in near cigar or your pipe\nGoing hey let's say the fireside chat and just discuss it it really it is it's a it's an opportunity for us both to sit down and just say you know what he these are the things that\nConcern me about retirement or and we'd go through a myriad of of different uh thoughts ideas concept goals et cetera and then I talk about you know am I the guy that\nPossibly be helped steer your lead you in that direction so it's a very very non threatening easy fireside chat if you will just to uh to get to know each other and see if it makes sense\nSo that number again as six one five six five six zero zero nine nine I Mark Kelly and John David what John David and associates John has been in the business now for since well since Nineteen Ninety three and we're talking about some challenges to and and really some challenges\nTo why you may not retire on time while you might be able to retire earlier than you thought you could there's a lot that goes into this and so you know a lot of people get caught up John and the number hey I Need a million dollars well I mean you have people that they can't retire on a million dollars and you have people that can probably retire on two hundred thousand [noise]\nEverything is is really depends on the individual or the cup while you're sitting down with when it comes to that but we do all have a number I suppose it's just different for everybody\n... and uh you know when it comes to that income number when you were looking at\nAsking that question how do you figure out what your income number is is this the the and he said what is the number and that is the the question so I'm trying to go okay if I were to a consumer how would I figure this out and what I Do markets tell people\nUh you know when we sit down at this this fire such as we look at them and go on and so what is your income number and people often look at me and they go I don't really know what you mean and I say okay well\nAnd that's a fair question because again they they don't know what the number is so I you know you hear different experts say you need a million dollars you need ... to replace eighty percent of your working income\nI'm a firm believer that you need to replace a hundred percent of your net income\nAnd so when I share that they they look at me and go okay what ... what do you mean\nUm because it did is confusing all these different numbers get thrown about and if it's not the world that you typically operate and people aren't familiar is what the number might be so\nI Would look at the number on the bottom of your paycheck every single week or two weeks however you get paid so if you're looking at it from a standpoint of okay\nI take home or you know three thousand dollars every two weeks my wife takes home two thousand dollars every two weeks\nSo you're basically living on ten thousand dollars a month\nAnd so is that where your number\nIs that your net number that's what your number and if you're living on that now I Would say too that's another caviar for if for making it on that number at home and live in a great life and living a life you want to live on that number that's your net number that makes sense\nYeah the net number what what's your take home yet or not what your your annual salary is hit I guess what you're getting to take home shirt so we never it's 'cause it's different because our taxes\nPeople sit down and they say okay well John I make a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year and I go okay that's great fantastic but what do you take home and they're like oh hey what do you mean like what do you what do you take home and your paycheck because when you retire\nTheoretically taxes should go down right you're not going to have the four oh one K. coming out of your paycheck you're not going to have the uh the essay or the age as say the health savings account come out you know there's probably a little bit of money that comes out of your paycheck for your life insurance deduction that you get through work\nI'm there could be something you know people have like Christmas clubs or they have these different uh\nThings that come out of the paycheck you know for for savings for example all that stuff is not coming out so it's really that net number of you're living on\nWhatever it is five thousand ten thousand dollars a month that's where we want to make sure we can replace but that's scary too a lot of people who don't do this every single day because the question becomes am I going to have enough money\nAm I going to be able to sustain my lifestyle and then the second question I often get his where's that going to come from so hey we got to figure out that income number and make sure we hold on and on that and we had a strategy to get that and replaced that income number 'cause if you don't replace the income number like you mentioned at the start of the show it's gonna be a\nBad retirement so we want to make sure we replaced the income number and then yeah where's that going to come from so yeah we're we're talking\nIf we replace this income number and they have a plan for replacing the income number and we know what that number is it doesn't have to be scary and I don't want it to be scary I Want people to come in and feel comfortable\nSaying okay I Know what my number is a I Need help to figure out what that is and I get that a lot as well so how do I even figure out what it is and will walk you through that\nThen we have to then say okay let's create a great strategy and we use something called the lifestyle maximize or I Know we're going to talk about that as the show goes on but the lifestyle maximize there's this one of the tools that we use to help people\nAnd it's our customs tool it helps you create a custom plan so that you could feel confident when you step out the you know your income is going to be replaced and you have the right number to make sure you could live a great retirement\nAnd I would just suggest folks if if you want to give us a call at six one five six five six\nZero zero nine nine\nCome on sit down do the fireside chat so when you called six one five six five six zero zero nine nine we know it's the weekend you're going to call to a call center\nThey're going to gather a little bit of information on Monday morning Karen is going to call you back you'll love care and super friendly outgoing a bubbly woman she's my operations manager care's going to give you a call\nAnd get to set up for an appointment to come and spend an hour will go through a series of questions and answers and just to have a nice fireside chats again that phone number six one five\nSix five six zero zero nine nine I'll look forward to seeing as soon\nYou know there's an awful lot that goes into retirement planning for a pre retiree and the fact of the matter is is that you have the build up you're ready to retire\nSomething happens and you just don't do it you're not really sure you can so you don't you put it off well that's what we're talking about today how do you know you can retire there is a lot\nThat goes into that we've got a lot more to get to stay with us this is a retired federal joined even with John Nagl and\nBeen ... during our questions\nFeeling telling you that if I could kind of vaccinations hit me with a ... feeling you don't try to keep going point\nYou have all kind of relationship if you are financially ... if you don't recommend having a hard to meet with John maintenance on that front\nCome to the patients in poverty and timely than we can they can learn all about you and your family want you to get down to the mid ... and that's the only time a person's delving tracked Kareem cutting five I think I think you're right here on Ninety nine\nOr anything from him only around ... way to get an how things went by the time you're on your own Ninety nine defined by the time you're on your own Ninety nine million I can only buy new invention you Amy my management at the un and even if you're not really any company [noise]\nRental property this is the number I have now so maybe that equates to four thousand dollars and you need seven well now we know our deficit is three thousand dollars that helps us start to look at\nYou know what our income number is how we position those assets to generate the deficit and so meaning how do we take the rest of your money whether it's two hundred thousand or two and a half million\nHow do we take the rest of your assets to generate that income stream is the important part so once you figure out the number that we can figure out where in what we use for tools and where it comes from two to generate the income\nYou know I Want to talk about our next segment about the emotional\nPart of inside of retirement because when you quit a job to retire and you go off into voluntary unemployment you're not seeing your co workers all the time you're not your daily activities your daily habits are changing sorted touch on the emotional\nSide of this but let's stay right now with those in talking about the how much do you need really to retire how would how do you go about figure and all that out I mean you said well what's your net income well how much do you spend month after month I mean is that as simple as it is it's kind of creating a budget\nYeah we got to take a look at what we're spending and so we definitely need to look at the budget and if you've never created one\nYou don't have to okay I'm going to show your share with you a simple way to really look and go okay what am I spending and where's it going so we we could create a budget or we could just say for example you could go on line at your bank right now\n[noise] log into your bank account and then pull a summary for the last two months and go okay I see where all of my money what you pull your credit card statement and say okay I see where all my money went on these credit card statements\nAnd kind of look and say All right I Know where the money is going but I think the the next step is almost more um Fort well they're both important because one you have to figure out and realize where your money is going most people don't do that because they don't want to know\nThey don't want to know that they're spending four dollars a day at Starbucks on a cup of coffee when really they could be putting you know some of that money into another vehicle unless they if if Starbucks is your your thing then it's it's worth doing but\nI guess it's all information markets looking and saying okay I Know where my money is going\nOr the next question is going to be do I like where it's going then you can make a change so we can either create a budget or we can look at your checking you know bringing your checking stuff thirty looking you're checking on line or look at your credit cards on line and just say okay here's where it's going and do I need to make a change\nSo we're talking about some challenges to win really how do you pick a retirement\nDate when is it is or by ages of my income is it a combination of the two my me or you just take them working well there's an emotional side of not working anymore but there are also some of those rest of the John just touch on we're going to talk about the emotional side of retirement and we're also going to talk about some of those risks that are out there that can add\nIn a little bit when you don't really want it to so we'll we'll talk\nAbout that here in just a minute stay with us this is retire fit with John name and John ... says [noise]\nThe [noise]\nWho retired federal John John maven and associates I'm Mark Kelly [noise] you know John believes that a person's happiness relies not on one thing but rather a combination\nOf financial personal and physical help it all goes together and living out their retirement of your dreams if you have questions about any of this at six one five six five six zero zero nine nine to sit down with John for that fireside chat no cost obligation no pressure for this visit\nSix one five six five six zero zero nine nine it's going to find out more about John you can certainly go to the website ... dot com it's John with an H named to be as an victory John ...\nDot com or talking about how do you go about picking your retirement date\nIs it by ages of my income well it's really kind of a combination but you certainly need to make sure that the income is going to be fine because you're now involuntary unemployment when you quit working so can you replace those paychecks and still do the things that you want to do and keep up with the bills and all of that but it's really about doing some fun stuff to when you get to retirement\nSo Jonathan the end of the last say my we we've covered a lot of ground so far but you brought up a lot of the what is what is myself or my spouse has a health issue how does that factor into our retirement plan you know there are so many different areas inflation market volatility\nOr interest rates going up how does that affect who I've got a lot of money in bonds right now because I think they're safe on weight interest rates go up bond values go down I mean all of these kind of what if things scenarios are certainly things that you talk with with your clients about right it's not always going to be perfectly gold paved roads perfectly smooth the rest of our lives you\nKnow we've got we've got to create that the plan first um\nYou know and and make sure that that we look at what some of these risks may be because you know just as you mentioned those those three or four things that you just mentioned between bonds and you know health uh my spouse and if I were and I was I was sitting here mark when you were talking about it and I'm like holy\nCrap I'm not retired I Can't cover all those things how am I going to cover all this stuff and then it becomes too overwhelming\nAnd what do we do we go back to crest of the nation but you can overcome all of those things and you can create strategies again just say okay\nWhat could be the worst thing that happens for for example when\nI was sitting with them and they'll just over the past twenty five years that there are a lot of people say uh okay I Can't retire because they don't have enough income or I don't know where it's going to come from or what if this happens\nAnd so when we create the different ah I call them ... because I think buckets or a term that most everybody can can relate to recreate for different buckets that we treat or a cash or a savings bucket income bucket a short term bucket\nIn the long term bucket each one of the buckets contain different sums of money they also contain different vehicles that we would invest it so when somebody comes in as it sounds as okay well what if uh I get sick or what if um you know I Need to replace the root for what if the furnace breaks\nAll these things are ideas that we talk through and we can help people uncover like the the tax issue what if what if taxes go up what are we going to do there what if um you mentioned my my wife gets sick\nWe can cover all these things and we do cover all of them and we have a plan for him so whether it's covered by insurance or it's covered by keeping more money in your safe bucket\nOr it's covered by just you know creating a plan that has something in place for inflation all of these things can can be covered so I don't want people to feel overwhelmed I guess it's probably the big thing\nIs yeah and that's certainly ... that's the heart of it though I mean it goes back\nTo our procrastination you know their holy cow what if that was what about it I'm never going to retire because I don't know what's going to happen I Need to make sure that we're okay and that's really the idea of of making the phone call to sit down with you I think is let's find out where you are\nAnd then see if we need to make some tweaks here there to allow you to retire and live out your hopes and dreams because it really does come down to the vision that your clients have for their retirement when you're putting that plan together it's not all about the the money it's not all about what are you know what what kind of challenges might be out there it's also about what do you want to do\nWhat do you want to do it in its emotional you talked about this is that going to go this is all very very emotional whether it's before you or it is fear it's all emotional so you knew that\nWas very insightful mark I live there was you know it is interesting though because there are you know\nThink about it you've you've been on the financial world since Nineteen Ninety three\nNow you have a lot of other interest you love going on the bike ride across Montana and doing all of these things that are that are outgoing and putting you in better shape and conditioning and all of that your big into outdoor living basically\nSo you know that that's part of view but you also know that John David associates as part of you as well you've had a company for a long time and one of the challenges when you retire I Would think I have a buddy of mine that I used to work in a radio station and he was a general manager we go\nPlay golf a lot and we were four years after he'd worked for a sea change jobs and they would say you know when you're playing with a group of guys you don't really know hey what do you do and he would say well I we used to be the general manager at the radio station that that mark works at\nAnd I'm like why are you still on that three years later when that's not what you do but that's how we may invasion himself as the general manager of a radio station he thought that had more or maybe more I carry a little more weight with the people were playing with and what he was doing at the time\nAnd so we do get caught up sometimes in our job is our identity don't win\nYes we do the nest is really a role so we've got we've got to get away from that for sure because\nWe want to look and go okay what is it that you want to do so we talked about income we talked about you know a little bit about emotions in procrastination but we've really got to look and say and make this comfortable we talked about a fireside chat\nUm but I Would suggest to if if you're married um you have a fireside chat with your spouse and I I think that we get so busy and so caught up with all these or other things in activities that we don't ever say okay what is it that we really want to do and I don't want people like okay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement Income Doctor",
