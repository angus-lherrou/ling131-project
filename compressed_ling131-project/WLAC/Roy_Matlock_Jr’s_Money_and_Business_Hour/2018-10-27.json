{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "[noise] sorry to interrupt the reason why I'm nervous because I'm not able to build it back up as fast as it started so it makes me nervous to take a big chunk out okay how big is the choke me about a third so twenty grand another sixty yeah\nOkay\nWell the emergency fund is there in case there was\nObviously an emergency captain our ideas here right so um but but if you think through your single\n\nAh yeah I'm divorced by divorced okay I have a I have a son already but I stayed in case I remarry Monday option to have more children and how old are you thirty nine\nOkay All right um\n\n[noise] there's two there's two things that are bump into my head and they're ... they're they're both are working against each other okay so I'll just say I'm Out loud all the ... was just process this together a little bit okay thing one is I tell folks not to use their emergency fund except for emergencies\nGuy thing too is this is very very very important\nTo you obviously it is and uh I mean it's it's\n... and you have a window of time you know uh so I guess when I'm going to do is I'm going to shop around and and make sure I've gotten all the possible ways to pull this off there's twenty grand the best most efficient most reasonable most safe\nWay is there a Fifteen grand methodology is they're thirty five grand methodology is or other things that cause I don't know anything about this at all um I mean other than the obvious to you know the higher level understanding of it but I'm\nBut I'm going to ... to gather more information anytime I'm buying anything for twenty grand I'm going to learn a lot and you may have already done all that but I'm going to I'm going to really push it on the research always the more options you have met when making a decision the better decision you always make you follow me\nDuring that time I'm also going to just be piling up cash like crazy like my hair was on fire let's just keep adding an adding an addict but the other thing that comes into my mind is forty thousand might be an adequate emergency fund for you\nAnd that's the ... this is not an emergency\nWe can say that for sure but I feel like I feel like it it feels like it is but it's not an emergency it's not a a it's not an unexpected event it's an elective\nLuxury that's very\nVery very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes I might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay because the catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way they would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight\nI mean ... manager and I ... I mean I assume you've got good health care coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it because\nI don't like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that lead up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get to forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay it that's a lot that's that'd be a million dollar expense you know so I'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process and this with you because I'm trying to figure out what to do it\nOkay um\nAnd if you want a super emergency upon backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like\nYou've violated a ... a principled process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better as a logical to you I think so yeah I think though\nHave you got a good friends or family or pasture or somebody counseling you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know [laughter] not doing this in by yourself to do what I've been told I don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying not necessarily good\nCounsel but friends and family say oh you know\nYou can find me don't worry about it all the crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look and your husband go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but I I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation\nThanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina isn't Rami roaming\nIts romey high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was on recently called call and buy a kind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a farm insurance products so I'll let you know term insurance and visibility which I agreed with and then I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some uh some other coach there were a lot better mhm and ah and I reached back out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah those are those are kind of like\nLetting those insurance companies aren't good their um their their ratings are high financially you want to go with the more higher expensive\nOr insurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next\nTwenty years you know we can't show ya yeah I was like oh okay um so I Need to\nBite you basically described as the Mercedes of ensuring the by just said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah I thought I wanted to get your thoughts on that [laughter]\nWell um that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay\nThere are there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance\nThey're so they're almost broke the state well let them sell in your state\nYeah they have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have term in life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nUnless you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now they go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progressive goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about this progressive have the money to pay my claim you know\nBut you can look I Am best ratings of someone at the sand or insurance his website and they are all financially solvent as much as this group or the selling the other stuff that's a that's a complete lot of BS rum Rome is what it was\nOkay with that make you feel a lot better 'cause I yeah I went ahead and do the the less expensive option anyways so I wouldn't because like I wouldn't do that for my family I was like oh yeah you know murdering el\n... and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that was when they call you that's all just one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah\nYeah if you are doing investments with them if you were to hold watch life insurance with them which we don't recommend so you'd be a lot more stability because you have a savings account or when\nThat's a lot more important this was not at all like [noise]\nAnd you're saying that uh the there were a couple of dozen accounts roughly at the same time tweeting the exact same the same exact thing right\nYeah so there clearly is operated by a small groups of people who made up fake identities the whole point is that they want to be the count look like they were\nReal Americans tweeting about these things and you can that was true also uh when they were treating up political issues and so these people would be you'd see a twenty four counts to the exact same thing at the exact same time or within minutes of each other and they'd be very politically charged statements saying things\nLike how can the NFL disrespect fly we saw that the majority of the tweets that had apart are feeling or\nFrom what the researchers called white trolls which means that they were a conservative and they were and those people were typically very much against the player protests are on the other hand you saw some people who are said\nThings that could be seen as inflammatory from the other side and very much strongly in favor of the players\nWere speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Andrew beaten his piece is called how Russian trolls inflamed the NFL anthem controversy or this is still going on I presume has been no attempt to shut this down to be a violation of free speech perhaps but I don't know is there anything like that happening behind the scenes\nOh all the accounts that reference happen shut down um but the\nThe the whole thing is though that\nWhen these account to shut down the new ones are made and new ones that are made so what so there's definitely still what the researchers told us that there is definitely accounts there'll be monitored that are that way then more recently on various topics whether that was\nThe Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick that will also drew a lot of charge reactions or the U.S open final between real Williams\nAnd and I only have soccer that also\nReally drew a lot of attention so it's clear that they the sport as a way into the conversation about American culture in a way to sort of discord\nSo they're obviously sowing discord of some kind of does that mean that the tweets are influential\nIt definitely varies I mean some of these cats didn't have many followers and probably didn't reach that many people on the other hand there were in each of a cat these accounts that grew to have\nA tens of thousands of followers and could have tens of thousands of retreats so it\nSo it definitely varies across a broad range of structure I mean of course it also needs to be\nPut in the context that that there's probably this is just a portion of the giants the of tweets that are sent on the subject that the obviously huge conversations for anybody but it's fascinating can see that these became a
