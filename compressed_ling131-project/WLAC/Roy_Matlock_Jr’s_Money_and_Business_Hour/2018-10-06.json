{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Very well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations thank you well what we teach folks is to follow a plan we call the baby steps we think it is the shortest rate shortest route to wealth\nOkay and a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved to his debt free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that for five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off out shortly so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that some non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nCrack and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right yup\nOkay and um the uh the way I look at that is if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities or boy you own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy those stocks\nDesigned by the way if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to three to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick\nI might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency fun\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that\nAnd I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you have that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nA it's only worth about a hundred and ...\n... ... only ... years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nOr be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind of weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd I think you know what all else will happen is did you do remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nUh yeah ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced once\nI'm done I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years in front of it\nYeah that's what I'm Talking about because there's more going on here than simple math there was a complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the window that's the weight you felt Thirty years I Can't stand this I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen\nIn reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any ... no wait nothing on your shoulder it\nThe way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity boat\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much you got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean you mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally when you're free you just do better\nAnd you make better choices in Europe\nBut he's making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would catch all the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten uh that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir so honored to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to the Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWell thank you signed up today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and ah we've pretty much become that free other than our student loans which we were working on and then we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her\nFirst child in April so we took\nYour advice and stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank and all that good and as of this month we we have enough for her to take her three month maternity leave 'em for you for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem is there's nothing has decided to strike a last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and ah the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a\nA baby on the way here in another two months and we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so my question is um what would you do it in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun than pay that off or what do we do\nWhen somebody do\nA better from the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that will usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball\nKobe becomes pile up the cash when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and threw it at your bat correct\nAs long as baby mama come home and everybody's cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have\nTo have it to eat with but I mean it's not um do it so that we can use it so how much cash will be got piled up or will you have piled up by the hour what\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she was knowing that she's wanting to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we were smart about this and set that\nGold and make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much I'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have from other than our car payment I Try and do you have you have actual that balances you need to pay off\nAnd time no not on your car and got much your your car rallies\nAnd ... and we'll be your\nYour pay it off out of this guy and as far as set aside enough for her to three months off\nYou have the cash you should\nTake this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now period on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to ... dot com slash show\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents with a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nOn and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of back up\nSo I'm yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist also author of the book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\n[noise] oh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nUh in that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad while you're ... that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington did she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got the more we have today\nOr how about like in the coming years you get the sense that we won't have as many issues as we have now\nI think the problem is is that we have we have had this um ah for a bill a bill has come in Congress since um let's say four or five times a since this all happened in in the south and\nTrying to mandate paperback up an audit insistent and lawmakers do not pick it up as an absolutely no interest in this been primarily because it's the the the houses are controlled by Republicans\nI'm we're having again this year as another build introduced to what exactly do the

you could share it with a serious subject you're wire sexual assault victims not always willing to come forward the reasons are many years this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I it's even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex I fill many many reasons why somebody might not report on a on a fault or rape\nOr it can be read traumatizing to revisit that to help people go over the details again\nA and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so there's a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position um [noise] uh not often that sometimes uh there's somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong I went to that party\nCoca Cola and guess what it work I mean the phone continue to work after each each bell what what did you find that there were any kind of limits to this [laughter]\nNot really I mean I mean technically there are limits I mean you know there's something called ... which is basically a standard which which basically means that ... that are shown that meets that standard can be submerged in freshwater for up to chew leaders for updraft our\nNow you know we didn't keep the iPhone and the coach for example the beer for more than a couple of minutes [laughter]\nReally not even that I'm so in that sense I guess\nYou know ... you know anything about it in the real world terms but if you are sitting on your desk and he spoke coffee on it you know what are you gonna do you're going to dry it off immediately and that's what you're supposed to do by the way for\nSpeaking with it may get us a DJ he drowned the iPhone and a bunch of liquid to see how it would hold up it's an important distinction to make because water resistant does not mean water proof\nCorrect correct and technically you're not supposed to swim with these I Do know people who do and they've come out fine but you know apple will will not tell you to do that and I'm certainly not telling you to do that I mean the idea Israeli or to prevent an action you know you drop it in a pot or or\nYou know or you you know by the seashore and certainly a big wave comes and hits it\nIt's that kind of thing you're not meant to swim with it though is that shed technically you can keep the phone and least standard ... you can keep the phone and fresh water for up to about two meters for a half hour or so I guess you could swim in it under those circumstances\nAre the phones on more durable than they've been or is this the standard we've been carrying\nAround on well we've heard it before but apple says yes indeed that um you know this is the most durable clash they've ever put on an iPhone I did not do drop trash I Know a couple of people who did and some people are reported no problems there were a couple of scuffed marks couple of people I talk to\nAgain apple claims it's it's the most horrible but it doesn't necessarily mean shatter proof so you know again my advice is don't push it to the limit yeah\nWhen you're trying to figure out um I mean is it best to stand it up right so maybe any or sideways do that once you can leak out of whatever buttons are holes may be in it um\nI don't know the standard way to dry it I mean I literally just took a paper towel and try and get dried up that way I didn't do anything ... scientific here but and again it was fine and we did ... saying you know there's pictures if you [noise]\nYou know direct people to the article at USA Today dot com slash tech you'll you'll see the video and you know of what we did and you'll see that you know it was fully Dallas Kim nice very slick rich but we've tried at just the old fashioned way with a paper trail\nThe big USA Today personal technology columnist by the way he says if you read the fine print liquid damages not covered under apples warranty so\nRepeat that just that he did at your own peril especially since you spent a grand to more to get the phone you just also your own does get

life is good right what could it be too good yes says Stamford Conn economic business trends analyst he shakes his head at the amount of debt that we've accumulated he's based in Long Beach California ... what kind of economy we're looking at\nWhat we're looking at a at a comedy that's doing well I Can't argue with the numbers is doing well but wearing a debt bubble car to me at all bubbles eventually burst you cannot keep going economy can't keep going by adding more debt faster than the economy is growing and that's exactly what we're doing and the quality of the debt now\nIs actually worse than it was at the peak in two thousand seven right before we had the financial crisis\nSo we got a real problem now you got a debt induce financial bubble outlook you think this is going to go on forever of course the bubbles go on forever they are actually they all burst I Can't tell you when that no one could tell you where he writes for\nThe debt it's a government and consumers are we just talking about ... ... you know\nIt's it's both I'll give you an example um all that both fraud municipalities and corporations are the debt now over a little over fifty percent of the debt from is a pallet is I'd be like a couple of government states and uh incorporation corporate that\nLittle over fifty percent is rated junk or one notch above junk when to me that's all junk in two thousand seven about twenty seven percent of that that was raided junk or one notch above jock\nSo you know you take if you take your pick a we're worse off now than we weren't two thousand seven\nAnd those people get into bond funds better be careful about the radio and those bonds of cars are those bonds are very low rate it they could be junk or a little bit above jock and the robot above junk they're called investment grade but to me if you're a little bit above junk it's junk\n[laughter] how did we find these new depths what happened\nAfter we climbed these new debt what was the question again\nHow did we find them well how do how do we get back to worse than we weren't oh seven\n... because of the fed lowers interest rates near zero for a long for a number of years so people went out on borrowed money like mad they issue a debt and they just had a dead end does financial bubble and the economy did grow in a work\nBut all all trends come to an end they don't go on forever and now the fed is reversing itself\nAnd guess what interest rates are going up the ten year treasury note went above three percent it still is about three percent and it starts climbing higher\nOrganic you people borrowed money at low interest rates lower rates going up that that will ... the financial bubble especially if the year when the ten year treasury note goes about three and a quarter percent and it's that's going to four percent the game is over that's it the gate all financial gains come to an end\nAnd this one eventually come to an end to so it's a matter of whether you're going to be
