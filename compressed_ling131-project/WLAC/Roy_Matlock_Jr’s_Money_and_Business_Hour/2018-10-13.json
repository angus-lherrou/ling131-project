I mean and everybody's I have nothing on it but the number five it doesn't matter they want to say that five of them like that does every\nDoes everybody bank with your bank\nNow so I don't know that I don't know that that that happens every time\nThey are like water that tire Jean\nYeah I mean and once you get a fruit for alone you don't want to do anything they'll go out and buy stuff don't don't try to get money from other sources I'll buy furniture forever\nRight at it closed on yeah I learned the hard way 'cause I'm a down payment down I ... and I had some ... you know we get money from and and the mutual fund or take a long enough out they were so you know I think that about five grand to give me the closing of all my mom was like have you flown we've had ran for a couple of days he was like yeah sure and I told her when I was doing\nAnd uh some part of the mortgage lender he's like yeah no no we can't do that I'm like why not\nI got to know where it's coming from his letter from your mother or something because like I was going to be from your phone I'm like I said a couple of days so he pushed back closing for a week and I got my money and we did it but I'm like I didn't have any idea that would be an issue right\nYeah it's we we have an obligation to fulfill the Lenny laws in the linen laws clearly state we have to prove where every penny is coming to how it where every penny is coming from that it's coming to closing and that's because of money laundering issues um yeah 'cause that can be mattress money how I mean\nAnd it may be legit money ... I mean you didn't might be money that you're like in case the banks closer there's a power outage I Can't get to an ATM I mean you may have whatever amount of money you've got at home or you may have it on a locked box is even though a lock box is that the bank\nThere's no accounting of it there's no record of it so where did it really come from\nDo they do we know that you didn't go take out some alone\nWith some loan shark or something like that and now you've got this high payment yeah that's true I mean it it all comes back to we learned our lessons from the financial collapse and all that stuff\nIn the years prior and a lot of the rule changes we see or we have seen or to prevent that from happening again yeah you know it's it's like your credit score a lot of people go or ask me questions why my credit score constantly going up and down first question how many credit cards you have\nHow much will be put on your credit cards versus before because your credit score will automatically adjust based on your balances at our increase it on your credit cards once you go over twenty percent twenty percent of your balance a ... year if you want your balance goes exceeds twenty percent of your credit limit\nIt starts to ... your credit score and that way you can't get yourself in too much trouble and go out to open up all this new debt\nAnd then before you know it now all of a sudden thirty forty five days later here's all these statements coming in and you're like holy crap I've got to pay out five hundred bucks more month right now but you didn't realize it before and right now\nSo the rules are tightening or had been tightened to protect you protect us as lenders and protect industry um another big one is\nNo job changes I mean people that change change jobs even if you're going from let's say you are\n[noise] um [noise] whatever you're you're some sort of professional and you're going from a W to job and you're saying you know what I'm going to start my own company and now you're doing the exact same work you're truly making more money\nBut now you're self employed and you're not W tuned yourself which a lot of people do oh yeah sure in the world that the deal killer I mean it's it's dead on arrival you don't even get started\nIf you're gonna make the job change do it the day after closing absolutely [laughter]\nAre you guys another reason to call the lender and I buy a house yeah oh my God just drive me insane people\nYeah the idea I ... I went to ... I mean like a month ago went to the house walked through it ... numbers look great let's do it\nI'm like have you talked to the lender about where you're going about what you're buying a match or pre approval you need to make sure I Will we did you know of months ago none and now let's do it again I guess what he just change jobs now going to happen you out on his on\nI mean ... you know you need to I mean and I get the ... that people don't know these things because you wouldn't know unless you're in our industry you probably just really wouldn't know that now but that's why you need to know all these things before he started jumping in instead of a ...\nAnd and the key thing about changing jobs especially going from a W two jobs to self employed is on your W to actually pay stubs\nYou can project out what your income is I mean we can go back and get an average the average it out as many years as we want or made much as we want we can look at your overtime and you'll get your bonus stuff and we can project out okay here's what your income is in a very comfortable\nSimplistic calculation when you go self employed\nTechnically you only have a pay one pace of the year and that's your tax returns cars on your tax returns you're showing all your income all your expenses and as a self employed individual you have the ability to ride off\nA lot of your income to reduce your tax liability so you oh hardly anything or you get a tax refund back at the end of the year\nWhere the W. person they've got a ... foot all their numbers into the box into the equation and it's but it's a boom just what you get and self employed you can pay zero taxes zero dollars in taxes 'cause you show zero dollars in income\nSo what happens when you you uh change jobs like say two months before he trying to buy a house that you have to there's a certain amount of history you need before you're going to get Malone ...\nIf you're W do and you're going you know same same industry you just took a better job ... or even a similar job in your pays the same as long as it's W. do it's no big deal\nOn pace to have to wait like six months or something and no no not unless there's something unique going on there are situations times where that might come up a a a problem\nBut I mean the big issues when you're going to be to to self employed because now you got in a way of approve what your income is until you file your taxes at the end of the year\nAnd I can't tell you how many times I've seen pianos proper last statements that show exactly how much is being distributed in every bucket and so forth but then you come back and you see that tax return for the following year or for that year later\nAnd you're like you know you know when we did this loan back you know last year for you and all this stuff was shown over here and you're showing making Fifteen twenty grand a month but then your tax return shows you making five grand a month mhm\nPlace for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time\nSo of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called the Bateman group and offices in New York and San Francisco and what the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slack room they'd had had to set up for the past year the flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room and if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it you know not\nThat well we're seeing what you've cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine\nTo some managers I don't know may not be worse than having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\n[noise] that's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said he's had to tell his his small team that there really is just no please for political bickering network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens is we can determine how they respond I'd want to see how their employees feel\nBefore they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or want it to talk about politics and then we go from there\nHow much of this uh boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think but we we heard on on all sides of this that there were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you I'm In and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nAh did not feel that just happened I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across the economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal reporter ship cutter

in many ways\nThe film divide conventional wisdom in some cases going against that wisdom actively seemed to help the film flourish in others to simply didn't hurt the way one might have expected Steve ... at the Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment says either way why oil producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nWas the case of you know a movie star war which shot you know in retrospect seems like a big hit of course probably Cooper directing it but he himself as well as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffet business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd probably a lot of except for the ... and the road shows\nYeah on the line but we're talking about the film and about the project that uh there's really no reason to think this would work I mean for those who don't really make you got the movies and the more we reached for granted I was really hard about\nFranchising superheroes I'm from other was a movie that's been made three times before admittedly whereas tied back in the seventies but with a lot of success before\nYour rules you built but we make a movie with getting when well uh in the past because you're going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version and again they bumped up a little too low during the sort of convention liberate the side and um you know and it ... to ...\nYou know that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not really making a movie that's already done well in debt that high\nRight you do you think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's the thing that was the last few years maybe more than a decade now that it was just ... of course I'm television as well is that you know and I feel this way all of us have a lot of people do see the same federal comeback but if if you're bringing back the classics\nOr if you don't look right necessarily when we feel like maybe a beach have been kind of a sort of aggressive versions of those earlier this week I think even managers so one had is that for one thing you know again it was back in the mid seventies so a lot of people even if they\nAre seeing a movie with Barbara Streisand and Christmas of course obviously in\nA you know it was a a a long time ago and I also think the world is changing the music world that are this document he's very much about a sort of a Mario Cooper's characters is based with our country Walker but like I was sort of a modern a sort of pop super so all the way to becoming that\nThat's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances in the seventies so you know just for civil remake it was a remake I think a lot to say about it and was informed\nThrough a great extent by what's happening right now\nWe're speaking with Stephen ... at the Washington Post covers the business of entertainment he's got a piece\nTitled the seven ways a star is born bucks Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway uh we were talking I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of near when I saw the\nOpening weekend box number of of uh like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to entertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oh well but but the number of perspective 'cause that's not really\nYou know they weren't after like a two hundred million dollar opening weekend\nThat's exactly right I you know I think these numbers are always funny where we get we get kind of get inundated every weekend now well on Monday rather with the box office numbers one weekend rabbis total and that's not really sort of\nA state of who should be using like anything else or any other financial benchmark\nIt kind of have to make sure you know comparing it to if you made you know a hundred grand in the stock market uh shares I worth that much but when it gets better hundred and fifty thousand to buy them that's probably not so good whereas if you made ten grand of course and and then we spent a thousand that's a pretty good return similar scenario I mean this is a mid budget\nMovies aimed at grown ups are not meant to be this kind of global assault on the box office the way that\nA fair might be for you after so uh you know the fact that he made forty two point six million when you look at\nYou know how how most of those movies do I look in the piece of the greatest showman which is a musical already quite well last year and we started out with eight million and and that's another factor here Gordon\nOf these movies tend to have with the movie industry calls legs that is to say\nYou know you have a the Avengers or you have a big superhero movie I can kind of caught on pretty quickly started more than it opens in October ... she wants out were meant to months out from Christmas still could play every weekend view if he does anything approaching even a fraction of that\nAre there to have a major hit on their hands and I think they
