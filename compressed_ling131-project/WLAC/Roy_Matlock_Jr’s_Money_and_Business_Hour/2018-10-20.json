I'm afraid of liquid data Atlantic I don't know anything an act three nights in a hot spot so I figure on Christmas at every loud and I would just write the check\nMhm okay ... okay uh uh the uh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip on pretty quick\nIf a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate and I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep 'em in the big one that Scott Moran margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so a migraine one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you hardly making anything on that and that you're in gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the ... year lose money on that house if you go to three months vacancy if the market softened up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically forty so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of us and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one then you guys just got a you know let's start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on through in getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd they'll just some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth I mean you making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway and that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike how are ya\nHi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my ... that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund film among baby step on the first time I'm doing a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just kept dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay M. and they're all going in\nA well he just seems like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're going to have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a doormat\nYou been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're you're just takes a little while to get other things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong\nPut more in there yeah so you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I bet people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more really\nQuick I wanted to ask one should I invested in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted to I don't want to learn just give it to you and then we have to worry about it\nOh okay All right now\nThat that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's one of your membership to that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online\nExperience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you're just visualize a yellow pay us forget every dollar forget a budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page mhm and then every dollar of\nMy uh every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page or most of the Exxon food and why on utilities and Z on rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nIt is a great up I made it it definitely the easiest one I've done other ones or in the past than this one of the easiest is\nOr the Harlem the problem is is you're facing your reality it's not the up and it's not the system but it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it you know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go\nOh I'm not forgetting all soccer picture and then I got this one building on you know and we know what the food really cautious and we know what the utilities really are\nA few things that are fixed that are predictable I mean you're renting or more is with us fix thing we know what that is nice but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjust so you'll get it on I'll have jelly pick up we'll get your signed up for financial\n[noise] by Dr Charles or ... or ... or social producer Honda rooms or your host and we'll be [noise]\nOne thing that hasn't really changed and and it's an accelerating over the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature your religion whether you are religious or a non religious heal race they have come\nInto alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm In the Nineteen nineties that ah\nI'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics but now it is increasingly the case that non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people are much more likely to be Republicans\nA you know we're seeing a much clearer sort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented by whites non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nA so we see the pillow race along with religion or increasingly starting to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more\nSo you know that's sort of suggest that you know even if you say that your political identity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important team increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer upshot at the New York times and she's written a piece titled American say their politics do to find them but it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell too so you had lots of different identity is at any given them and you know you have a radio show you are a man\nA you know you know from a particular part of the country are you affiliated with your home town\nAnd whichever one of those that's important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identities or for other identities so for example\nA you know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that is more important and then worrying about the the federal deficit\nBut political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shift to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in what you're thinking about but\nAh that that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion that we reach\n...

S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having the you know set up a whole\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level in for that make things harder and drives up costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level [noise] um you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nI mean we could we could you

take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nA of a decision so in other words if if there was a it looks like this particular case we had a complaint and said that there was an assault attempted rape\nBut no rape kit no location no time no all the things that would fill out a case even on the next day it happened the day before that would
