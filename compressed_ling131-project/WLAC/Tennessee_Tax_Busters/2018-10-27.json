tune\nBefore we left for the break we were talking about I raised ... and a big sneaky underhanded downfall and maybe not underhanded for us to be a question I suppose I made but I got to set\nThat I got all that the ... for everybody just in case they are just joining us so we're talking about IRAs and ... and how a\nIRA we've been widely told that stands for an individual retirement accounts but if you look up the publication five Ninety on the IRS website you will find that Uncle Sam calls it an individual retirement arrangement\nAnd the reason behind that is because your IRA your four one K. your tax deferred retirement accounts are adjoining account with Uncle Sam so\nEvery time Congress started talking about taxes you need to look at your TV and say I have an arrangement with those guys right\nYou do and and the scary thing is the the uh the downfall that we see is that who gets to change their ratios of how much money in that four one K. your IRA is yours\nHow much is the government's when the government ... and so when push comes to shove and the IRS and the and our government says you know what we can no longer pay our national debts bill\nWith the tax revenue that's being created we have to raise taxes what does that mean for your tax deferred accounts that means that Uncle Sam is going to come in and say All right\nMore of your account as mine now when you take this withdraw I'm going to keep more of it because I'm going to raise taxes or I'm going to do away with the ... or I'm going to get rid of exemptions and we're going to talk a little bit about that cliff came up with a a a really interesting concept that I Want to get to about a\nFew didn't ask me and my question now many don't worry don't worry we're going to just stay tuned we're going to talk about uh the government taking benefits away\nOr what they really do to kind of scared that issue because they don't they don't scoop in LA I'm taking a hundred thousand dollars a year IRA as they don't do that well anyway cliff I Know you want to answer this question so I asked cliff before we left uh for the break if if we could open a joined account together and investment account together\nAnd if I could change the rules year to year\nOn how much of that account was mine and how much of his and if you would do that or not and what's the answer\nAs much as I respected in Meyer and care about you thought about this deeply and the answer is no\nI'm Glad you put some thought into it I really tell you wait the option there you go well I've had a little caffeine now this morning and my brain is thinking clearly you know but that sounds ridiculous right that sounds ridiculous to somebody sat across the table for me and said hey let's open an account together but I get to change how much of that account his mind and your is your ear and nobody would do that\nBut that's what our ... and our IRAs and our tax deferred accounts are exactly right\nBut there's a way around it and there's a way to protect yourself from it and there's a way to put yourself in control instead of letting Uncle Sam have all the control\nBut it will not happen on its own and you need to work with a a team like ours if not ours like are somebody who has the tax professionals the financial professionals and the legal profession\nOr this or yeah there's a legacy issued definitely yes I Am\nAbsolutely all under one roof so that you know you're getting the best information from all the sources on the spot and that these individuals are working together for your benefit\nBecause how many times if we had people come in who say well I was told X Y and Z a non back to X Y and Z but I was in all this this is so about my retirement account and so I I took these actions and we're like\nThat hurt you yeah and there's no way that you can undo it yeah war there is a way that you know do it but it's going to be hard yeah\nSo you don't want that to be your case so when you're making these big decisions make sure that you're getting a second opinion talking to multiple groups find out who you click with and who makes you feel at ease and who you think is going to bring the best information for your scenario to you\nAnd I've heard you ask people lot are you comfortable enough with your president playing are you comfortable enough with your present advisor to get a second opinion there and if you are in great let's talk and if you're not then that ...\nAbsolutely so when you're thinking about those I raised us for one k.'s and that taking tax time bomb that's just sitting out there\nAnd and how Uncle Sam may or may not be able to affect your future retirement if you want to if you want to get more information on that we're the people to talk to the number six one five for for one twelve Seventy four again we have offices and Dixon Bellevue Henderson bill and cold springs and we'd be happy to meet you had any of them I'm On this\nOn line and clear retirement dot com or being so there's a lot of ways to reach out to yeah\nAbsolutely you can even see Andrews handsome face and my bearded face on line there you have to grow that beard back out and it's kind of coming in a little bit but yeah so one thing we haven't really talked about I Know you're kind of leading up something but I feel like this is this is an appropriate place to maybe bring up but I'll let you decide um\nSo when we talk about how they can change the rules on ...\nAnd that so that affects this idea that we had when we start got started getting into these programs of a well maybe we've got to make different plants instead of just letting them set for the next ten years Twenty years Thirty years right\nWhen all these things were put into place Social Security benefits were not taxable right\nAnd then in the early eighties they became taxable at a lower level than they are today and then in the early nineties the Clinton Administration up that even higher so eighty five percent of your Social Security income\nIs subject to taxes if you make more than a certain amount of money right that's right right and and the numbers that were decided on how much you can make I think they're like forty four for couples dirty for singles I'm not sure but somewhere right around there I'm not one of the tax guys but they are right around there so usually\nThose numbers kind of go up while you know I Am more expensive you know there's a place in cost of living and so we up those numbers how much you can you can make before you start getting taxed\nHave those numbers changed at all since the early nineties now no so the income that you were allowed to make in Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd not get taxed on your Social Security benefits same dollar amounts same dollar amount today is that thirty three thousand thirty two thousand dollars is that still it does not have the same buying power nope no it's not worth the same I mean so when you're gonna be lucky to fill a tank of gas at [laughter] do you get a big car\nBut uh but still I mean and you get to that number quicker because ... how much you're going to make is probably higher than it was a Nineteen Ninety two yeah or Ninety three or whatever\nAnd and so here's here's an interesting idea that day ... kind of bringing up and leading us into um so what what's the issue if if Social Security gets tax a little bit why is that a problem that I made a X amount of dollars which is great for me so why does it matter if my Social Security gets tax a little bit\nYeah well go ahead you're on the ... though\nSo it's interesting there was a study done I'm comparing individuals who could keep their Social Security from being taxed by using active tax management which is something that we specialize
