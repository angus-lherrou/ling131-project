and what we do and why we do it that way yeah I got a lead you into wind diversification\nRight give it a little bit of history here and and you know I've never thought about it and just now but does it ... diversification aspect about our finances is that it's touched by all these different areas where there is a state planning our taxes are Social Security or or for one case or whatever\nAnd by working as a team and are being you know under the same roof and under the same a philosophy\nThat's I've never thought about it but that's really kind of form of we're providing that dirt

estate planning you know whatever whatever your needs are we want to be able to help you\nWe have clients that they they only uses for taxes tax prep or they only use this for bookkeeping or they only use this for investment advice but the truth is the vast majority of our clients have come to us with\nThe idea of I just like the fact that I can get all this in one place and I know that gallon stock in the clip and close talking to Andrew Andrew talking to Greg and everybody is talking working together\nTo come up with what is the best solution for an individual so you as the individual you come in and you're saying I Need a team of people and really what we're doing is to work as a part of your team because you should be a part of that decision making process\nAs killing often says you know we don't want you to come in and just say hey tell me what to do whatever you guys decide that's what I'm going to do those those situations\nThat's a little nervous I yeah I mean it's you know it's a huge liability obviously if you say that um you know we're going to make a decision that we think is best for you\nAre but it does to a lot of liability on her shoulders that that we would rather not have especially because we think we can explain it to you where you will understand it and be able to make an informed or you know an informed decision that's best for you on your own right after we presented you all the information right and that's the way we really like to do it\nIt is and that's why we have to get to know you because we don't come to you with a product and say here's the product we want to sell you we come to you and say we want to get to know you we want to stand your hopes your dreams your goals what is it what is it the Craig says you're once\nYou're once and wishes and we want to know that so we can put together some suggestions for you that really mean journey folks hang on because when we come back we're going to get into this little bit more how we can help you the difference we can make in your life and your financial planning so hang on you're listening to Tennessee tax busters ... every time a tax advisory [noise]\n\nThe\nWe are the Tennessee tax busters and were brought to you by granted retirement attacks advisory has been in business for over twenty five years in the middle Tennessee area and really we help people all over the country\nBut we've been talking a little bit in the first segment about how we use a collaborative approach of bringing people together in the areas of investment advising\nRetirement advising financial or the whole financial planning spectrum but then also the taxes are planning\nThe Social Security planning and even estate planning and we we have a team of people that we tried to come together to help people to have all one placing ... some people have called her one stop shop to come together and get answers to how all this works together and and that's something that we feel like as ... and I was saying in the last segment with like we've done really well and providing that\n[noise] yeah I think people really like the one stop shop idea of the one stop shop approach where you know they know that their investment advisers working with their tax repair um\nYou know to make sure that everything being done it in their best interest not just um you know their taxes or their investments but their taxes ... so I think people really liked that idea\nAnd people like convenience you know I I get here you are easy\nAnd you know I mean I don't want to I don't want to be accused of blasphemy but we're kind of like um you know we're kind of like the super Walmart\n[laughter]\nYeah actually the idea of super Walmart because it's cheap but we're not open at midnight went out of it at midnight and ... says oh John what I'm trying to check out in their thirty registers there's only two of them open\nAnnouncer you want to compare to that at our ... you can get everything here the the good thing is it didn't\nMean to me it's not only a matter of convenience I think that's definitely a where somebody would say hey this much more convenient because I don't have to go from my tax adviser and then my finance or my out a tax plan or and then go to my financial advisor and then go to my attorney and talk to them and I got to go to the Social Security off to find out this stuff\nAnd so I went got her several different options we looked at those and then she came back to me and and she said I said we can do this or this or we can do a mixture of the two she came back with the answer of I Want to do a mixture of the two and she told me exactly how she wanted to make some so it was her decision ultimately about her retirement account\nBut it was my job our job to kind of educator on that process\nYeah and it's this kind of the same thing we tell people what taxes you know we're happy to answer any question or were absolutely willing to do any tax planning we can do to help you in any way but at the end today is your taxes yeah if you give us information and you've lot\nAnd you get audited we're not getting the out of it you know look at it you know that is ... and you know unfortunately sometimes it happens some of somebody brings the information you're like you know I Know that's not true yeah and you try to weed that out on the front end and sometimes you do and sometimes you don't but it's ultimately it's your money into your decision\nI don't know if you were in the meeting I was going to be with Craig one time with a guy in Bellevue and basically\nThings weren't adding up to the guy was saying and he went to ... to do some things with his taxes the credit just finally said no we can help you you got to go we're not we're not what's the old saying we always use with people is I I'm not going to jail for anybody so but that's not usually a problem with the people that we do we have great clientele so now\nBut when we come back we're going to be taking a break here and just a moment we're going to we're going to start talking about different ways to diversify not only through you know we think stocks bonds diversification or whatever we'll talk about diversification like that we're going to talk about diversification within accounts and we can talk a little bit more about why we feel like we\nProvide a good solution or if any of this is something that you'd like to find out more about give us a call at six one five for for one twelve Seventy four [noise] uh we're unclear retirement dot com we'd be glad to talk to you help us we're the tendency tax busters ... by granting retirement tax advisory [noise]\nRaasch Hannity on Fox News talk radio tiny eight point three and Fifteen to end\nYou're listening to the Tennessee tax busters were brought to you by renting retirement tax advisory serving clients middle Tennessee area for over twenty five years and clients around the the around the world and fluid Jimmy ... [laughter] good [laughter] so as\nYou go [laughter] so ah Jimmy keeps it entertaining we just try to keep it informative were not very entertaining and I'm just joking were not evil learning we're not [laughter] no yeah we we are not even that was a happy\nLaugh but are we we've been talking today about um just our approach to financial advisor in tax planning is is a little bit different than what we see most other places because a lot of times you might have a\nA an investment firm that they have people who do taxes that work with them\nBut we have tax people that really understand the investment world I've been involved with it for decades um Craig's been doing this for over Thirty years so he really understands that will kill and actually I'm is educated formal education is in the accounting attacks area but um he has his licenses and the investment side as well\nAnd so we work together as a team to really try to help people to look at\nWhat their investments plan should be what their retirement plan should be in those are distinct different things\nUh how best optimize Social Security how they can prep or not only do tax preparation but how they can do a little bit of planning to maximize their tax situation\nFor their investments situation or might have some bookkeeping needs if you're a small business and how best to maximize that\nAnd then also how we can do estate planning and has been joking you know it's estate planning people are always like well I I'm not rich I don't have an estate the plant but if you got anything you've got an estate\nHas a son as you'll see in the news a rich person died and you know they left someone out of there will they didn't have a will and it's like their state was worth an estimated one hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah and you're like well you know that's an estate yeah but it's in a state\nIt is and planning man makes all the difference in the world when it comes to that and that's so we're just a very glad to be able to provide to our clients and to prospective clients a place where people can come be hurt a where part of their team and we come up with this team approach of saying how do we accomplish your goals your wishes your dreams\nAnd we can move ahead with that so that's something you any questions about\nYou know feel free to give us a call at six one five for for one twelve Seventy four or we have offices are around middle Tennessee area primarily around Nashville but Dixon Bellevue\nCool springs Henderson bill and we can meet you in other places as well and and go over some of that\n... we were talking about um [noise]\nJust the various things that are important about our model and what we do but uh we said we're going to talk a little bit today about diversification and a diversification a lot of times as you and I were joking earlier you know if you own a stock\nAnd you buy a second stock you're diversified sure as long as you wanted everything is you know if if you got four one K. and you own a piece of property ear diversified sure so what is diversification mean when people say it what does it mean about what's the best way to help you with the kind of in your mind what is the\nWhole purpose of being diversified yeah so the whole purpose of being diversified is that um\nThe stock market in real estate and dead and all these things move independently of each other sometimes one will go up and the other will go down sometimes both will go up sometimes both will go down but as a general rule everywhere you can invest in doesn't all go down at once you know there are times oh wait was one time were just about everything took a hit\nAnd before that nobody thought that could happen\nAnd nobody thought it was hot or yeah it was a ... it's not true that everything to get there were things that were successful in a way um but as a general rule those move independently of each other\nIn the last few years bonds haven't been doing very well great ox had been doing very well in the next three or four years that might completely reverse\nSo the idea of diversification is I Want to spread my money out so that when one thing goes down these other things go up and I don't lose as much money as I Would if I was all in one area right so you know it just provides you a little bit of a safety net a little bit of a cushion against or something bad happened in in one particular area\nAnd what diversification should be for you when you're twenty five is going to be very different than what it should be for you and your fifty five and would divert diversification should be for you when you're fifty five it's not the same as your friend down the street who's also fifty five right everybody's situation is different\nSo we want to look at how best do we help you to diversify your investments the cash you have on hand the investments you hold your four one K. is whatever\nHow best to diversify those so that you're protecting yourself against the downside as much as possible while yet the goal is really not just protect yourself against outside but how can I get the best return with the least amount of risk chair and ways to measure that\nYeah sure that goes back to my my definition investment advice as how do I get the most return for stated amount of risk rail a on a scale to ten I'm\nFive risk was was the\nBest return I can get and where do I get great being a fashion where eight so I could still sleep at night right but I'm going to have what I Need ... you know your diversification\nGet very much be depending on how risky are just you know or if you're extremely risky diversification is gonna be a you know in just a few things right if you're conservative it's going to be in just a few things if you're somewhere in the middle that's when you're going to get a little touch of everything\nYou guys ever get anybody that's almost ten I just like I'm Crazy I Want to\nKnow because what is now the way we describe it this way we describe attend a meeting\nYou're willing to put all your money into a very or your best best all your investment to a very speculative investment today lose it all by tonight and still have to pay the fee attended of the day almost like shooting craps in Vegas yes in fact I mean it's just you know somebody who is really into futures or commodities the really risky side of that\nOr options or something and it basically not who we are right we got our Kleinfeld because we're trying to work with um a retirement planning\nTrying to move more towards people
