others along the way and then you know like it was silly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make this\nA book [laughter] the the big lighter that's if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against a tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um with

bill and cold springs we'd be happy to sit down and talk more because like like Craig said he gets\nIn the next ten weeks talking about the new tax law he wouldn't get through all of it so we're going to hit some of the the highlights today of course but the you know if you've got questions which you know you shouldn't you will um give us a call the number again six on five for for one twelve Seventy four but ... going on\nAnd I don't want to bore a lot of people were certain specific things that may have no relatives to there are a lot right is this like taxes in financial planning or customized approaches yeah there are certain things that affect everybody on the tax code and the tax law\nBut it's very much things that can be customized for people circumstances I Know Andrew dice clay if we have meetings with people\nAnd I searched exporting Ross conversions to them\nAnd they're like oh you mean I don't have to do the full Roth account\nNo you don't have to the ... the conversion of all your assets junior four one K. or IRAs and stuff like that I said I've done ... conversion is a small one or two thousand dollars to as much as over a hundred thousand dollars yeah because it makes a difference depending on your individual circumstances\nAnd I hate being the bad guys tax time so I hate telling people what I'm filling out the forms and I would have found something too long ago holiday was for folks because that is the boring part of it but that's what people see that's what they think the tax and tax preparation attacks planning years is filling out the forms\nOur transcends a new long ago that was all it was because I hate being the bad guy when I feel the forms out because I see too many lost opportunities or somebody\nHas got to pay more taxes they should have because they didn't do something before the law changed allowed them to do things and that's and that's because the world ends on December thirty first every year for most part\nFor the IRS so there are so you can generally in March it out and say hey here's an opportunity for you to go back in time and make a transaction happened back in December that would've benefited your tax situation yeah\nOr benefited your retirement situation oftentimes when we talk about Ross conversions with people\nAnd they ended up paying Fifteen cents or less in taxes\nAnd the thing that's going to benefit for me for the next Thirty years and benefit by shorter or grandchildren wherever I'm leaving the money for generations as well oh that makes a little bit more sense right there by so afraid of the planning process or they don't know there is a planning process they don't know you can control your tax bill\nAnd that's why you do your retirement yeah and that's what it means our clients like in the last quarter and we don't don't wait until the last couple of weeks of the year right but the last quarter we meet a lot of clients because that's where those plants that we put in place to meet in January defeats the purpose of\nTax taxes are year round process so anytime we tell people that have a life of it happened births deaths divorce marriage\nGrandchildren any of those type of things that happened to you during the year hit us up we try to form relationships with their clients that were there confidant that could say hey this has happened in my situation what can I Do to help maximize my position from their financial standpoint or attack standpoint so\nThe biggest thing I Want to get across to everybody today is there are opportunities\nIf you take control of the situation yeah you need to give somebody a call if you were working with somebody that you feel like is just a preparation house that does nothing but ... says you give them and fill out the form and does it give you stayed back up things that you can do or not do\nThen you need to look at the beginning that second opinion just like we talk about when the financial and getting a second opinion on taxes is a problem is that I Do all the time for folks and the majority of the time that I Do it\nThey ended up becoming clients because they realize they're not getting that feedback that buys loop from their tax preparation service\nYeah 'cause it's just different just just filing and actually having some active tax plan is very very different things and it takes different types of experts to do do those two different things so you want to make sure that you're working with the right type of council not the right type as an advisor because like Craig said\nThere's there's two different ways that people approach taxes they let the tax system yank 'em around ... around the neck\nOr they work with somebody who knows the tax law and can use it for your advantage to that your in control of your tax bill and you're in control of your taxes in retirement you have the two choices one takes work in the other you can just do\nPassively but if you want to optimize your taxes you need to

is Fox\n[noise]\nRaasch Hannity on Fox News talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen to end\nRadio Ninety eight point three and ... the this is the Tennessee tax busters and we are granted retirement tax advisory welcome back to the show and if you're just joining us welcome to the party we are talking about taxes that are into that strike so exciting so exciting\nBut before we left for the break um you know we were talking a little bit about it a change that has come into play with active tax planning his tax preparation an active tax planning are completely different things\nActive tax planning is something that could benefit anybody when they're you know it closing in on retirement in their fifties and your sixties active tax planning is paramount to a portfolio and not enough financial advisers are doing it for their clients\nBecause most financial advisors don't have the education the tools necessary to do so and that's why you're granted retirement tax advisory we have tax specialists and financial specialist working hand in hand so that we're not only optimizing the portfolio of our client but we're also optimizing those future tax liability risks so\nUm we talked a little bit about Ross conversions that's taking money from a taxable account and moving it over into a tax free account\nUm and being careful going forward doing that because we no longer have what's called the ... characterization used to be able to have a duo for quote unquote a do over I messed up Iraq converted too much I Want to fix it and you used to be able to do that now you can't\nSo when we do active tax planning and Ross conversions and when I say we I mean everybody you know here in in in our uh in the United states when we do Ross conversions we need to make sure we're doing the right amount the first time now because we don't get to do over\nBut this segment that was all about living tax free and retirement or and and I talked a little bit in in our last segment about\nThere's two different ways to approach taxes you can either get yanked around by him you know let them lead you around with a chain around your neck because the taxes are going to do what they want or you can work with a individuals like Craig Hendricks has been doing taxes for over Thirty years\nUm and really knows the tax law itself work with somebody like that and make the tax system work for you take advantage of all different tools that are are are living in the tax system that people just aren't taking advantage of because we don't know that they exist\nSo I'm always amazed sometimes people are afraid to take the time or possibly even some money to invest in saving themselves a lot of money left and it's it's one of those deals of you know well I'm not gonna I'm not going to keep my car\nOr in good repair because I don't want to spend the money now right and then they wait and then all of a sudden they've got a big bill coming down the road so a lot of times the act of text planning is\nPutting a little bit now you know what what is it that uh that Kevin always likes to say you know\nThat the the ... build their commercial you can pay me now or you can pay me later yeah and it makes sense to dump the good thing is in down to talk with us or talk or text advisors is that it doesn't cost you anything but some time in an open mind to to to find out this information and see if it can help you\nWe want to get her about it on their options and what's available to them is and the biggest thing about three characterization I'm Still for doing Ross and ... it's just we ... we don't have the motive for us now so somebody has not\nDone analysis on the current your transactions to make sure that things are correct and or the tax situation but\nYeah actually comes from time to do the taxes\nIs important to be proactive on the planning process because the motives not available anymore so you may have to choose show he's been working with your browser and maybe doing ... less earlier for yourself\nIs not a rubber stamp to say okay I'm going to do twenty thousand because of your circumstances changed your taxes this year it may not mean that you want to do twenty thousand right yeah\nAnd you don't have that option available anymore to do that\nSo and the other lack of education I think that exist within hours standpoint is even though the Roth is out there and they are as loves getting money on those taxes for people doing Ross conversions a lot of people say they can't do it because they're not fifty nine and a half years are there are seven and a half\nOr there are um they require Brigitte ... you can do I did Ross conversions personally in my twenties\nYeah and\nA Roth conversion can be done by age bracket depending on what their individual circumstances or for that particular year right doesn't make sense for them right so that's why we analyze things on a year by year basis for their clients are very well may know exactly what we're going to do or think we know what's going to be done\nAnd the clients come in knowing expect you to tell a story I had a hard time and a couple of years ago but educating you with the ... version of the last few years and she came in so I wanted to thirty thousand a year and a random numbers at Ford if they weren't sure what thirty thousand looked like\nA ... you know we're not jumping brackets we're getting out of a comfort zone yet what forty does for\nUs or do you feel comfortable that we ended up doing fifty 'cause she saw\nPercentage was it didn't really affect your taxes that much fifties that are doing thirty ...\nSorry situations every situation is very different so that's why it has to be customized approach for your situation for that particular reason yeah or certain people when I mentioned before the break but I've had to undo a couple of ... versions of my history\nAnd the researchers I should it was because they forgot about it a ... or are they did transaction that we did not envision what we did the tax plan and yeah\nAnd you can in the reason why anyone would want to utilize the rough conversion is a as I kind of led to ... at the end of our last segment you can live tax free enter retirement people can do that\nNot not everybody is some people who have really good pensions it's difficult for them to get into the range of tax free living in retirement but most individuals who are going to be using their own assets their personal assets and Social Security as the majority of their income in retirement\nIf you put a plan together you can live tax free and retirement you live you know out from under that cloud of wind will taxes go up right\nAnd the people that can't maybe get it to a hundred percent can get some of their assets in that study but what I was going to say\nIs I Can't sit here and say a hundred percent of people can live ... some people make good pensions and then they just have too much taxable income to ... live completely tax free right\nSo I Can't say a hundred percent of people can live tax free I can say a lot of people can live tax free if they have a good plan put together which we can help you do what I can say though is that a hundred percent of people can have complete control over their taxes in retirement if they have a proper plan put together but it never happens on its own\nYeah too many times we feel like we're in a position where Uncle Sam who's got a sticky hands on our pockets that he's totally in control\nAnd we forget that there are options that are in the tax code that give us some control if we activate those right and that's part of war you want to sit down with a professional", "show_name": "Tennessee Tax Busters", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
