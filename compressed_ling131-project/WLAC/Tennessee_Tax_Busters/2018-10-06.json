Gordon Deal thanks for listening to this weekend [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWaiting the future of Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court I'm Pam who sales Fox News\nI Do believe that way well confirmed judge Kavanaugh to pay our next U.S Supreme court justice\nSenate Republican Joni Ernst as the chamber prepares for a final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination the Iowa senator telling Fox is near ... Bhutto it's clear to her that the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh were baseless\nAnd there's some truth to that but it's sold out of fear yeah and uh you know kind of experts say the stock market crash any day you know and and what experts you can find somebody to tell you anything that you want yeah\nThat's the truth is like if if if you're hearing an ad that says experts say this or experts say that I promise you for every expert that says something negative about the market there's an expert out there saying something positive about the market and vice versa and what that means is that don't go out and find the information you want to find\n[noise] build it and make your decisions on the Internet yeah yeah and they saw on the Internet and you you can find\nYou can find um the the positives or the negatives um anywhere you want out on the Internet or on TV\nBut the truth is is that a good strong financial plan the financial plan that will help you sleep at night is the financial plan that takes into consideration that the market's going to do one of three things a hundred percent of the time it's going to go up\nIt's going to go down or it's going to go straight across it's always going to be one of those three things and there will be times at the market\nMy next three mistakes 'cause I I don't want to give away too much but there are other options out there then\nEverything else so we're talking about what those taxes are finances all this stuff works hand in hand yeah there's not one individual thing that's a trigger for all this stuff they all have some\nSemblance of continuity between the two or three or four or five however many topics that you have to talk about so you got to be cognizant of what's going on and looking at a global approach standpoint to make sure that you're taking very driven your title to you\nFrom the financial as well as a tax end of it so that you're getting a good plan together\nYeah see that's key because something Andrew now we're talking about earlier Greg and this this was right in your will houses\nIs that you know I was talking to a medical professional here recently\nWho understands a lot has handled uh most of his investments were family really well but I was saying but he was like I don't know much else what ... I don't know what else there is that I can do and he told me a situation where he's putting a lot of money into just a regular brokerage account so he's paying taxes on that money and I told them about some options of being able to convert\nDifferent types of retirement accounts for people that are high earners and he just was like I didn't even know\nI could do that kind of stuff and he was a very smart purchase smart guy\nAnd he's very smart in his field and he's very he's very educated in our field but you know as a layman and he doesn't know in in maybe as an advisor\nI wouldn't have known about some of these options if I didn't have the text guys they're right there and not in office right so being able to get on the phone Cregor telling and saying hey this is the situation what about X Y and Z and then being able to say you know this is what we can do for him that I mean the guy just looked at me like you know I had I had a third eye or something yeah I I\nHow did how did I Know we don't know what we don't know exactly\nRight and that's the hard part there's so much information out there we don't know what we don't know but so that's that's the big mistake number two that we keep seeing again and again is\nLeaving money on the table or so if if you feel like you might have more cash and then you shouldn't you just don't know what to do with how to optimize it in such a way that you're not taking a bunch of risk but you got money and investments that aren't getting what you need yeah yeah give us a call six on five for for one twelve Seventy four\nAh or check us out at clear retirement dot com we'd be happy to take a look at it and we never charge for our time so if you come meet with us uh\nWe'd be happy to meet with you and um and we don't charge for our time so\nUh we're going to be back in just a minute to talk about the last three big\nMistakes that we continue to see again and again to hear what they are super exciting lift excited I Hope you're excited um we'll be right back and just a moment it's the talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W.

C. we're the Tennessee tax busters granted retirement and tax advisory [noise]\n\nRadio Ninety three and Fifteen ended up yeah Lacey this is the head of the tax than we are granted retirement in ... he welcome back to the show we're talking about the five mistake that we're seeing again and again and again with us seem to be retirees and a newly retired\nIndividuals and the first was fear based decision making the second was leaving money on the table having too much cash or not optimizing your cash and if you miss those two segments\nSend you want more information give us a call six one five for for one twelve Seventy four or you can check us out in contact us online at clear retirement dot com um but we're going to jump\nRight in and go to ... big mistake number three something I see again and again drum roll ... da da da da da da da da da da ding for retirement late or what I mean by that is not starting to save late\nBut transitioning from your accumulation mode to preservation and income creation later then what would be optimal\nSo any time if they pick up yeah as good as terrific right so we're talking about the optimal knock them all so I don't want anybody to hear me uh say what I'm about to say and then think oh no I'm starting to late and then not do anything right\nBecause now we have big eyes and that's a bigger mistake now is the time it's always today today is the time to make these decisions for yourself\nBut if you are listening today and you find yourself in one of these groups um what what I'm finding again and again and Craig chime in on this too 'cause you you sit in on most of our first appointments with me and cliff you as well but\nA lot of our clients that come to us who are transitioning from the accumulation mode of their life to the preservation and an income creation mode they come in the early sixties\nEarly to mid sixties and it's usually the story where I'm going to retire and six months or I'm retiring in a year yeah what can we do\nAnd there's a law already retired already tire or I got retired yeah you know they retired me right in and even though that's still good you know it's still good that those individuals are coming in their planning with us\nIf I had somebody come to me in their fifties and say hey I\nKnow I'm probably not going to retire for another ten or Fifteen Years [noise] but I Want to start thinking about it now yeah that gives us so much opportunity and I I Would say the fifties and early sixties this kind of the sweet spot to start thinking about that transition from accumulation to retirement\nFor a lot of times if they're in their mid fifties during the conversation we have with them is here's what we would suggest now and you're putting those plans in place yet and I\nI think too you know the the the the history with our as four one K. is everything that we've been experiencing over the last\nThirty years or so has been put us there let it grow your draw it out sometime in the future mhm\nAnd the problem is there's almost been no education to people about how to start being more conservative\nOr to make sure that you don't have a ... type of it happening in your chair out\nThis growing maybe prevent you from being able to make that decision you wanted to me because there is though for most four one K. is that we look at it and now ... there's very seldom very conservative option yeah yeah or options or conservative that we really like\nBond funds being more than ... or the ones we see in four one K. is\nAs their option course bond funds are getting killed as interest rates rise ready I'm seeing that happen right now yeah\nSo what we try to encourage people to do ... step one is saving which we are already said but step to this about you know we all want to ride the rocket ship as long as that will go and take all the returns that we can get which over the last couple of years have been very good for most people\nBut we also were because of those things run out of fuel every once in a while\nYeah and Margaret she this trajectory forever right\nYou know pulling back some of those", "show_name": "Tennessee Tax Busters", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "06"}
