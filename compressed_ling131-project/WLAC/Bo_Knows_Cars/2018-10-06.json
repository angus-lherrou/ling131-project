{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty thousand divided into two hundred thousand right well it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you can do it in about five years not counting getting raises not counting saving even more that's the most I Would want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay you know when you're just pay yourself house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great how uh well\nGo ahead and get lazy and we did it might be a guy did maybe I hadn't heard time and say maybe a little bit where\nUp to you if you're gonna go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nI'm thirty one years old is very young was zero house payment you you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again pay yourself a house payment plus or minus\nIt's a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you sound like they like create your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah is with us from Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm\nSure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve mine good for you\nAnd yes and I'm Down to just one dead ... which is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm ah with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at a credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband than a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt album and just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems with it one is you're actually owed them money so you should pay it yeah that's one probably the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just because they're not\nReporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that any time\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with it was just not downloaded their files to a credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark what a bad mark because this is a defaulted\nThis is a bad bill it's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at that point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a\nYou know a lump sum up three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing okay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question [laughter] I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax sheltered anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit mhm and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options and\nI'm from the other options for to take a fixed\nAnd they were the monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums are non you're alive and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um\nSo uh [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call that his bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners were friends together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that I ... and you have a good you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart buster pros and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value we're down in value either one no no insurance huh backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was just comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old or\nSomething like a growth in income ponder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm you at Seventy 'em and they wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smart vest or a day Ramsey dot com put in your in probably drop down a list of the smart Mr frozen your

with Dave Ramsey eight hundred\nOf you do what's your opinion of buying a vacation home with cash and the renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with it all with cash and your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else just by for a vacation home\nIs a wonderful extra as you start building somewhere else but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna you're gonna make usually enough to\nAfter you pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season where the ski house or your house in the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines is you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your boy\nIf you look\nAt it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the dollar per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there's a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living\nIn their sleeping in your bed and you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it is the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not he wasn't a frat party in there it was you know babies and\n... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broke English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\n\nLet me put it this way for Sharon Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second homeless or vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a a lake house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall met worse and so there are toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value and both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in the ... you know the the condo the other day we stopped and there are going to ... when the ball game over there and the he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out\nSo three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine", "show_name": "Bo Knows Cars", "year": "2018",
