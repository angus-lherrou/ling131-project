about that down the road when you had little or no choices that's what a risk analysis us\nSo why do you think it's so easy to kind of neglect preparing for risk when when we're kind of in this bull market is so so hard to to sit down and look at the\nRisk well a lot of it as emotions I mean del bar is one of the most leading a research turns out the studies investor behavior and\nYou know people are very emotionally driven or they feel really really good and for almost when the market is going up and feel really really bad when the market is going down and they they want to believe that they they buy low and sell high but for most people they they buy high when they're feeling comfort and they sell low when they're feeling pain and\nWe think that any investment decision made out of fear out of emotions is a bad deal for the consumer you should never do that would begin or or anybody else\nBut you know it's it's one of those things that if the market is doing really well you feel like it's always going to do really well and markets are not designed to just go up forever and are they designed to go down forever I mean\nYou know uh it's usually a once in a while we'll have some of them come in and say well you know I was got this email the other day and somebody was telling me how ... the economy is going to crash and burn and\nAnd I should sell everything I have and buy a bunch of gold coins or something like that and or they've got the perfect place I can put all my money and typically what you'll find somebody that selling a newsletter or book or something like that there there is no perfect answer\nOr what needs to happen is you need to understand your risk and if there is a downturn and you're retired or you're close to retirement as your income going to be there\nBecause what really hurts people in retirement in my opinion is not market downturns because those happen\nIt's market downturn combined with the loss of income or having to sell securities when the market is really low so if if I have a good income plan on not having to sell my risk based assets\nAt a low and I'm probably not as concerned if I Know I've got an income coming in so it all kinda fits together but it is important to understand that risk\nWhat you mentioned this a little bit and answering that question and it brings us to kind of lost the blind spot on the list\nAnd it's a big one is procrastination I'm this is this is such like you said it's very common it's come and particularly when there's a bull market that we're in it's common for people to be looking to to make a change to to give that extra measure of preparedness on their plan\nAnd so I mean I Believe all the folks tuned in today show would agree that retirement and was planning is extremely important or they simply wouldn't be listening to the show because they don't want to just hear a pretty voices\nSo why is it so easy for them to stay on the sidelines when it comes to retirement planning and not just jumping in and and kind of grabbing the bull by the morning going on I Want to get this right I Want to be very ... and when my plan well\nI think there's a lot of reasons for that I think you know first and foremost in a life gets busy um you know I've got three young boys ah that that all play soccer and a family and ... and obviously work and my church and [noise]\nYou know generally speaking people are are incredibly busy\nUm but they also kind of feel like I'm you know there's there's so much information they ... they don't know how to decipher it all and that's why planning takes\nYou know time is not an immediate decision with us or anyone else or certainly shouldn't be I think a lot of it is is a lack of understanding that's why I Believe our process is is unique in the sense that it's about educating people about getting data into their hands\nBecause the truth is we want people to understand what they have and what options they have regardless if they do business would be can or not\nYou know sometimes I feel like they can't afford it you know when you when you use phrases like full service wealth management and we have a CPA in a state attorney were financial advisors\nWell you know I come from a farming family average household income or where I'm from is about forty thousand dollars a year so you know I'm I'm blessed to live in Williamson county or here in Nashville I mean any pocket or an ... for the most part it's a great place to live\nBut I understand what it's like to grow up in that field I Can't afford things and so the truth is you can always afford to have a good point\nAnd then its analysis paralysis as we call it you know people just get stuck\nAnd you know the the fear of of something new and it's not easy to sort of barrier financial soul out to somebody that you don't know or or maybe feel like um there's some embarrassment there may be that you haven't planned well or whatever\nBut the bottom line is um you need to take action 'cause procrastination will cost you know this is aimed to us is very biblical you know clearly they asked us has a ... eleven forces\nWhoever watches the wind will not plant whoever looks at the clouds will not rape and ah you know regardless of whether you're a person of faith or not that's got a lot of truth to it you know if you don't take action you're you're never going to know whether your situation can be improved or not and you may find and going through the analysis that we offer\nThat you're exactly where you need to be I just met with a guy to day they came in and it was a very unique you came in really good guy told me\nThat he had been to all kinds of dinner seminars and things like that and he said I've never followed up with anybody and he said there was something about yours that intrigued me and I wanted to come in and I wanted to show you what I have and what you thought so we looked at what he had\nAnd um we talked for a good bit and I looked at him and honestly I could not improve it she had really done a phenomenal job for his family had an incredible plan had worked with someone in another state and then moved here recently\nAnd you know what I really respect that sometimes we can't help people they don't want our help because they don't need our help but there's a lot of people out there that they're never going to know if they don't take that first step\nSo if we can help you will tell you that but if we can and will be able to show you that to research and through process because we believe that's really important so love blind spots\nThat we've covered here today how quickly go through the list again but we looked hidden fees are getting not having that forward looking tax plan not knowing your retirement and number\nNot optimizing the Social Security income that you have another big one not factor in in the longer life expectancy we're outliving your your retirement or in fact we just go ahead and take a brief moment we do have a download available today on outliving your your money so again text the word save S. A. V. E. to six one five\nFour fifty zero one two three a number six on the list or is not including the effects of rising healthcare costs were going up tremendously won't continue to\nAnd then not sticking out the riot visor on John talked about the value of a really trying to find someone that's going to a blind with your philosophy and really give you in our opinion make sure they're covering their comprehensive approach the retirement\nAnd then of course the the last one procrastination and so ... you're sitting on the fence trying to figure out what to do do something today pick up the phone and give us a call or go meet with another ... that you've been you've been thinking about just do something today when you go ahead and take take action\nYeah I'll tell you there there's no

are going to give you a solid answers on whether or not we can help you and if we can help you great if we can't help you then you go on with a lot of peace of mind and knowing that you've got a really really good plan\nGive John in the ... six one five three and five three thousand scheduled visit 'em and if you're ready for change are looking for a second opinion like John mentioned there is no fees there's no obligation you're you're not going to have a bed sales job when you come in and\nThis is a service that we're offering just to help you get that peace of mind to look at that extra measure of confidence that you want to return to plant\nAnd if there's gaps and we can help great if not we would give you a blessing and singer on your way and I wish you will and everything

more than half of house\nUh it sounds like a multi ... even if you rent for six months or something you know I moved back in this price range a you know it wouldn't if you worry wouldn't make any sense I'm ... and so this move down to half of the house is probably a three to five year plan\nCorrect okay\nAll right because you're going to do something to get your income back up a without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work or get that part I'm not asking you to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nBy agree because that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in sphere so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this was a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling in and make it your life\nThen I'm cool with that that's kind of where I'm saying so hope that helps a good question and a courageous decision on your part to do that James is with us in Rochester, Minnesota how James how are you\nI'm pretty good thank you for taking my
