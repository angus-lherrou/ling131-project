{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Outlived or he's he's still alive he's Ninety three years old now he's he's still here but he's not as old as she was yet another year he will be in so I mean men do live into their into their ... even sometimes into their hundreds\nYeah so the question is how long will your income last where your money lasts as long as you do\nAnd can you account for inflation on that and so really when you talk about planning for a long retirement you want to play in for a good long retirement\nAnd how do you plan for a good long retirement you want to make sure that someone has done a longevity study where your income is sustainable it goes up with inflation you know talking to a guy recently who said you know\nWe're taking the same amount of money is out today as it were ten years ago but just doesn't seem to go as far well the reason as it goes far as because of inflation and so you want to really plan for hopefully it will be a very healthy and long retirement for you and or your significant other\nBecause people are living longer and it's a it's a huge mistake not to do that and the uh this last point I was you know I Want to park on some today because I think now given where the market is some of the volatility we've seen and just as high as there's there's probably never been a better time to be talking about this next point and that is that your plan\nShould match your risk profile and that is a key an important question\nWhile we love doing the full blown comprehensive analysis for folks and just this past week I was able\nTo deliver one of these to a family that listen to us on the radio and finally pick up the phone and came in and they were so glad they did is I went over this analysis there's lots of things covered in that analysis cost them nothing but an hour of their time there's a\nThere's a fee report or risk analysis and income plan a stock intersection plan a Social Security maximize or how forward looking tax strategy and more in there but one of the things that in there John is uh as you know in the early section\nOn on their risk and one of the things that if you're somewhere where you can write this down write this down to ask us about if you come in it's called variants me a R. I. A. N. C. E.\nI showed them their variant score and they're wanting to protect and conserve and be more conservative and they're variant score John was Seventy two that mean that that's the rains that it could very in one year and a negatively or positively so it was like\nYou know if we had a really bad year they could lose as much as we'll call it thirty six it was in the thirties and then if it was a really good year it could make thirty six they're like well\nI think it will look back in the past we know there have been years we lost thirty six but we don't ever remember making thirty six and one year but how why you're variants score is determines how much risk and volatility you have\nAnd they wanted to be conservative and they weren't even moderate they were beyond that aggressive\nYeah and I'll tell you ... you know a very similar to a couple I sat down with who getting ready to retire in about six months and\nSimilar situation there variants was a positive forty one to a negative thirty eight and uh they said well how do you feel about that a civil look when you're in you're working years\nA wider the range of variance better you are because if the market's down as long as you keep putting money in that four one K. are that are I don't don't quit investing when the market is down ... you're buying stocks on sale right because over time the market comes back your dollar cost average\nBut I said when you get retired you want to narrow that variants you want to reduce it because now you're not putting money and you're taking money out and it's a much different occurrence ah and people don't typically change\nTheir strategy so narrowing that range of variance when you get close to retirement or really be what we call the red zone of retirement which is really the five to eight years leading into retired but I Will tell you this\nIf you are concerned at all about how high the marketers and we in the market could keep going some of the fundamentals of the market are very very good um but then there's some\nThings that you need to be aware of for example I had a gentleman asked the other day goes what do you mean I said well how about that in America as an all time high goes oh no I Know the national debt is highs and no not the national debt\nConsumer debt consumer debt today Seventy percent of what drives our economy is consumer spending and there's that has never been higher than it is right now sooner or later people are gonna have to pay for the debt that they've racked up and so I'm not saying that the rails the economy but if I'm retired and I'm looking for ... double\nIncome and I don't want to see a lot of ... those are facts that I Want to be aware of and I want to make sure that my risk score is conducive to where I Want to be right now to stage in my life\nSo what is your wrist score and would you like to know\nWe'd love to be able to show you but what you need to do is pick up the phone give us a call right now dial is number six one five three nine five three thousand if you don't know\nWhen is a good time to find out we think sooner than later and especially if you are now in the red zone of retirement that's five years or closer into retirement many of you when the last big loss in the market\nTwo thousand and eight happened you were a long ways from retirement now you're in the red zone is right around the corner here already retire and now you're in the withdrawal staging the conservation staging the moderate stage\nDon't you want to know what your risk or might be you need a strategy for this and then ongoing as you get older and begin to take this money out in time is not on your side as much you need to make sure that you have a strategy for that so we love\nTo help people with mitigating their risk profile and their risk by giving them more of things that are more income generating\nPrinciple protected getting reasonable rate of return bond alternatives these kinds of things again\nThese are the seven things that were brought up a in this Forbes article last one being your plans should match or risk profile and I think over the last ten years this is probably the most important time right now\nThere's a lot of things to consider not trying to scare anyone we're trying to warn people this is a perfect time than if you feel uncomfortable you need to get your risk taking care of and you need to find out what that risk score is and what you might do about part of it so again\nAre you ready to retire\nYou might be more ready than you thought you were you may be a lot further away but either way it's good information to know because then you can act on those things and do something about it\nSo we'd love to customers on for you and your family and easy to understand financial review that's really going to indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial planning there's never a cost her obligation for an initial review to off color so\nUh if we have a meeting with you and your family we visit here's what you can expect a gift from us the first thing we're going to do\nIs we're going to work up a customize retirement income plan that uses proven strategies that uses techniques that that are meant to give you confidence in your retirement income whether that's now are down the road everybody wants confidence in their retirement income the next thing we're going to do as a detailed stress tests\nAnd this is where we're going to look at the current risk in your portfolio that is really vital right now do you have too much risk do you have two little risk that can be both ways but if you have too much risk and you're close to retirement or you're in retirement now's the time that you need to know that\nThen what we're going to do is we're going to run a fee report\nWhere we're going to show you how much you're paying for the investments you have and this is can tend to be an eye opening experience because many times people are paying much more than they should be or need to be and then the tax analysis\nAgain you can never avoid taxes completely but if you could reduce them if you could be a fishing in taxes and keep more money in your pocket and your family's pocket\nOr would that be a good thing fees and taxes in our opinion are the biggest the ease of your hard earned money\nAnd you need to have a strategy to pay less that's just absolutely critical and short or trying to do is take a guess work out a financial planning for you and your family so pick up the phone right now give us a call six one five\nThree nine five three thousand

Bebe dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sales what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up and the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the tree and the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get alone lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot she's bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nShow 'em they rose utility to borrow money no direct just telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the doubt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and wide show important to be intentional even with the little things there is one thing you can do right now to take care of the little things before they become big things and that is checked\nYour coverages and make sure you've got them right we have a five minute coverage checkup [noise]\nOh you do is text check up to thirty three Seventy nine or go to Dave Ramsey dot coms like ... takes five minutes five minute coverage checkup and you can make sure you're doing millionaire stuff\nVery important to do that\nCheck out the words of thirty three seven eighty nine\nStraight talk on life and money this is the day Ramsey show on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen to in W.
