{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Right and I don't want to have an argument [laughter] and if you want to argue you can just go look I'm not arguing with you already made my decision and honestly if he sells whole life you can buy your term insurance cheaper\nWhole life companies don't sell cheap term insurance\nRight guy I contacted Vander okay last week\nWhen you get your term insurance in place you can just cancel with the company directly if you want to call the agent you can call them I don't care but you know their job is to save the say you'll lose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself\nAnd so there's no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve in the ...\nI wasn't going to have it I was just going to be undergrad can't no matter what no but I didn't know if there are certain steps now that if I did take I Would leave out on getting on the most out of the cash value whatever they're\nNo there's no difference at all all you do is you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't good customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know asked them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value what's the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow Walker ignore your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancer on a credit card you got to argue with him to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to sign a piece of paper forget them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've\nBeen on laying off of down how the seven months ago on ... on a really challenging time because we have a child that was in college that can be there on that little to pay for and that's how I have a case where I can take care of dating extent that they can hide it and not ...\nI'm going to try to figure out in the\nHat and shooting that killed ... can be called fair ... pounds on or taking a stand alone on that I just want to make sure that we're doing the right thing since I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to work together fading on cars and lost my job at this time\nI'm Sorry you did than than than than she lost her job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\nIf you're\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got to do so what a mouse to his you're in the middle of a storm we get a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] on coming out and vote total was going to have to pay twenty three by coming out here and I have to pay about eight thousand\nOkay and do you have eight thousand way do okay\nWell I mean even if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\n\nThan you have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout five and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband may finally be okay and what did you used to do in software support\nAnd how long have you been laid off on down Saturday nights wow not been able to land somewhere worth\nYeah definitely acted ... and I'm\nI'm getting around something in that period of time in that field\nThat makes two of us working on it working on it\nOkay 'cause I I Know in other words the good news is you're in a an active technology type position that ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely\nYou're not if you're in an active market a metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester or two and get a job and pays eight thousand\nOne of the two but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life out of your husband's income\nAnd that's what you push through\nBut I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money I don't teach people to borrow money at them borrow money some urgency don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid\nAnd greed and fear are a good way to lose your butt with money for sure\nSo don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force have for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind of game thank you for taking my call sure one in my hand and and I aren't brand new ... in August that can kind of northern California and in our new we\nI had a guy and kind of ... ... para educator and kind of a school district has been getting I and our goal here that cash and we had\nThat and and\n... and ... anyway anyway ... eternity we now have to pay well out of line against it about four years ago and had eight thousand dollars you're meaning\nLike retiring say they aren't giving him the ... may campaigning I think the dollar and the next in here to finish paying ... dollars\nHe retired from there\nHe left the company all day long hearing uh twenty eight year if if the wine\nAnd today we had an accurate higher and\nNow that doesn't matter on this you're you're a four O. one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do own fault it's Irish regulations\nI think it had to cut back on it that that ... that he can continue to maintain that\nAre just getting around and I don't ... I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer can find a regulation that aligns with the with what the companies are saying that's fine but I don't think that's so\nThis weekend you're tuned into Tennessee matters I'm Robert want today we're talking about the disorder known as bipolar it's a difficult subject it's something that was\nIt difficult to diagnose it's difficult to deal with once diagnosed and it's something that it's ... there's not a whole lot of of concrete answers for people that are finding out that it's something that is affecting their lives either personally or with somebody that\nIs close to them and we're talking about that with a guest joining us on the phone right now an expert in the field who has a book that came out on September the twenty fifth\nHis name is Michael ... Michael good morning to you how are you doing\nI'm doing fine Robert thank you very much for having me on your show\nAbsolutely I agree but I guess first often I characterize the issues surrounding bipolar disorder accurately or at least partially accurately as we said things up here\nYes and unfortunately that's very true I think\nAre so many people are facing bipolar disorder where the they understand that they have a diagnosis for there I'm sure of that or\nUm something is happening in their life or the changes in mood so drastically that it's a fiercely something that they can personally understand or it's happening in the last one\nAnd for many people families and friends they witness\nBipolar in front of them in a part of it becomes a part of their life as well and it's a very insidious and often mysterious kind of experience for a lot of people and the more that we understand the more that we know about it\nUm I think a better chance we have is like fighting and getting treatment for it because it really is um under identified an under treated just about anywhere that you can do that you can say that you can find\nI Do want to delve into that as far as some of the things we do know and certainly as the case goes all the things that you talked about in your book but one of the things I like to do whenever we're talking about a particular disease\nAny kind of an epidemic or health issue that seems to be somewhat prevalent I Do like to do for the benefit of our audience ... I think ...\nAre and that's where I really got a great advanced education and the power of story of what you can do with great storytelling factual change what people create and how they create a different future\nUh towards the end of my career moves into doing strategic foresight which doesn't sound quite as exciting as telling stories but it all came together for me and created this idea that if we could create positive stories about possible futures we could actually create a better future for every one\nWell in what you're ... you're mentioning I don't know that it it doesn't sound as interesting because I Would think that very much a part of whatever to a strategy you go into planning for Walt Disney and then that doesn't mean the story telling\nProbably is part of it how much did you feel like you were a part of what we know with some of the ... particularly with some of the properties that are in are staples of our our our families on lives and what our kids know today\nA large spent most of my time working on projects it won't losing fearing for Florida although I I did work at the other forces well ah I spend\nA lot of work for a cause obviously because that was the first one was about thinking about the future and telling stories about tomorrow so there's a good chance that if you've been to Walt Disney world and almost anywhere I probably at least been involved in that project in some form or fashion [noise]\nWhen you look at the body of your work and you did that and how that kind of drove you to look\nAt whatever your next chapter is I guess the literally in this sense as we get into the book that you wrote to tell us a little bit of a I I guess maybe what there is some kind of a\nParticular event or experience that happened within your work there and that that that was sort of the spark for you to wants to write a book\nThat's are absolutely was um about Fifteen Years ago I started working on a project called would ultimately was called a hundred years of magic and it was a story Walt Disney's live\nAnd so I had the opportunity to do really deep dive into all of the things that he is on and that's when I discovered that wall was actually an optimistic futurist most of your listeners probably don't remember this now but back in the early fifties when he first started\nAt a television show that was called Disneyland and one of the sequences on the show was called tomorrow's land\nAnd they literally did these programs were entertaining and educational that without things about like going into outer space and landing on them\nAnd what I realized by studying his work was how powerful story could see how we can actually create the future by sorting out by imagining what we wanted the future because [noise]\nWhen you talk about reimagining our tomorrow's making sure your future Doesn't Suck and that ... sounds like there's some direct application to to what that did that influence of tomorrow land was\nYou're talking about something far more than just the happiest place on earth when you're talking about people's teachers aren't ya\nOh mom trying to take that idea and turn it into reality for people own pride or turn it into a world where we can actually all share in some of the great abundance this possible with the technology that we have today [noise] what\nAre some of the things that ... in particular I mean obviously tomorrow land is something that involved that Tamara land from when I was a ... a small child in the seventies to growing up through grade school in the eighties clearly it's a different\nVision of what Tamara looked like men as to what we would think of today so absolutely\nAnd and the future all our vision or future always evolves as we move forward\nI think what's interesting today is that we have the ability to start thinking about how we use what I called digital empower them off\nAll of the tools that exists that make it possible for people to be more creative for individuals to do things that used to take an entire organizations to actually create as a business or as a non profit\nAnd as you start to realize how we sort of unleashed people's creativity what we're saying is creating a whole new world in the future that's much more about how do we share experiences how do we connect with other people\nHow do we create a world that really spread those promises around [noise]\nJoe your book it talks about a number of of different issues at an understand that it it kind of broken into is broken into some of those different things that you experienced at Disney or give us a sense of how it's set up and how it pertains to the overall theme\n[noise] somewhere\nClose reimagining the future is breaking up into stories about several different segment of the population of the first story is actually evolved aging boomers and how do we we imagine what it means to retire\nAnd is there an alternative to assisted living facilities in nursing homes there actually possibly more humane and give people more independence and using things like robots and data and some of the other technologies is out there I imagine how we can change that actually made the golden years truly goal to\nUm I look at what it might look like in the future too we imagine a suburban living as we start to feel old suburban idea and turn it into a\nVibrant communities neighborhoods almost digital villages where people actually interact with a different forms of direct democracy and use things like the ... chain to actually create a different future\nI take it all the way through to think about what it would be like to be born it was a young child saying we're twenty thirty or twenty thirty five and what that future might look life\nFor that ... the main theme is that as much as we talk about how the digital world and things like our cell phones are moving away from each other I don't think that's true I think the reality is just just creating a new kind of community and as we get battered understanding how to do that will actually come closer together\nYou know it was neat is the way I hear you talking about it it reminded me I grew up in the bay area California of course that's where George Lucas and spend a whole lot of his life in ... in the marine county area and the the tail goes ... or\n... it was driving around the bay bridge and by the new shipping port where he saw the shipping loaders\nThat can work where you see these these giant white metal structures which would load and in the cargo on and off the ships well those later became the ads\nThat we saw you know in in a star wars movies particularly the the empire strikes strikes back in where he took that part of his reality\nAnd incorporated it into what he would see as this futuristic perhaps in a long time ago but there's some antics aside the idea of creating what could be a different type of reality I guess there's some common threads that right\nOh absolutely I'll give you a great example I just I was at a conference just this weekend called the summit for good and one of those speakers what's a young woman who might have been twenty four years old\nWho got very interested when she was a teenager on dealing with plastics and how to use all the plastic pollution problem and now at twenty four she has a company and they've actually created a process where they can extract of chemicals from plastics\nAnd so that you don't have to dispose of them the way we have in the past creates a product that has incredible value that can use the chemicals for other purposes\nAnd solves the pollution problem and that happened to somebody once again\nTen years after she started thinking about what it would mean to try and solve the fall of having too many plastics her mouth so to exactly what we're trying to inspire and people is this idea to look at your world see what you have available to you and then on a leash or imagination and think about how you could create something different that would benefit youth and those are those kind of figure community\nAnd that's probably a and that's one of the things that maybe you you you think of that\nMaybe that's the main difference between people who are innovative and don't work and there's a there's a need we all these needs and challenges in our lives\nKnows that are able to create the solutions for themselves or whether they exist or not and that's and that's that's the difference in succeeding and and sometimes that solution needs to be created and that's the that I guess it's kind of where you know when they're at\n... like one of the motto is we have with a lot of the work that we did at Disney probably facing worthless wouldn't want it to inform people we wanted to inspire them and we wanted to empower them\nAnd why now what concerns me because I think so many people look at the future if they see presented to them and I don't see themselves as being empowered to see the future is being created by somebody else for someone else but I Want to empower them again I Want them to realize that they can actually do way more women remember 'em out just [noise]\nIn the book again it's called reimagining our tomorrow's making sure your future Doesn't Suck\nJoe give our listeners some information on where they can find out more about you or about your
