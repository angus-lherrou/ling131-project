I mean we just had a big knock down drag out about a two point six percent tax cut\nAt the top level when historically we've been fifty sixty Seventy Ninety percent\nHas been the top ... level you know so we get more to that another time but uh people don't realize that there are ways to just do things today that are going to help you down the road but once you get down the road there still some things we can help you with but they're not like the planning you can get done today\nYeah that's true time time can be your greatest ally or your greatest enemy and it's all depending on how you use it\nAnd the unfortunate thing that I've noticed ah being in this industry as long as I have is that the average person weights past the point of opportunity for ... maximum opportunity I even a clarification to you because there's always some opportunity but the average person weights past\nThe point of maximum out opportunity to capitalize on what they've saved right for their retirement and uh most people don't think you know they come in and uh yeah we're we're I'm about to retire my last days in three months what can we do and I was like well first off I Wish that we started talking two years ago um\nWe usually do say handout ally with the ... but\nThe truth is is that if you're about to retire in three months now is the time yeah you know in in\nIn a you may you may\nAfter you talk with somebody wish that you'd come in earlier but\nWe live in a society of ah stuff in our face right we got the Internet we've got marketing we've got too much from it yeah too much information thrown at us all the time and we start to just focus on what seems to be the most urgent\nAnd a lotta times unfortunately for close to retirees people in their fifties coming up uh towards retirement in the next decade or so there are Fifteen Twenty years or so\nUm they're not thinking about how do I structure my assets in the day for Fifteen Years from now because there's too many other\nThings they care right and you know I I was on ... philosophical for a moment I was talking to my college student here recently and I was like you know your generation and and really it's it's all generations living today whether you're twenty or ... or eighty you know it doesn't matter you're everybody's been affected by this but this the first generation being raised like this\nIs for ever it has been who ever has access to the information has the power has the control whoever has the education has the power has the control for the first time in history weren't ... everybody's got access to all the information and it's\nWho can weed through all the junk right and focus on what's important\nAnd and getting back to what you were ... the reason I bring this up because what you were saying is we get so overwhelmed\nThat we don't do anything yeah and so the thing is whether you're twenty twenty five thirty all the way up to retirement name of the numbers there you go out to go through a mall but or whatever your age is there something about where you're at and your life right now when you're planning\nThat there's something you should be thinking about playing for so we talk a lot of uh here because a lot of our clients are pre retirement or during in retirement um and so we talk a lot\nTargeting towards people who are a little bit older but the truth is if you're young you should be thinking about should be putting my money into a taxpayer to defer to count how should I maximize my four one K. her fourth ruby if I'm going to how should I be using\nAmbulances ought to be a weekend you're tuned into Tennessee matters I'm Robert one as we get closer to Halloween all there's all kinds of spooky things that are going on yeah of course there are but you know one of the preeminent spooky things when it comes to musicals it's playing now at\nT pack at the Tennessee performing arts center joining us on the phone right now to talk about that a little more in depth yeah you heard part of it before we started this segment here she is she your angel of music she joining us right now she plays Christine die in a in ...\nLes roots here um I started to make new friends are and just everything's changed from ... right there you know that's that is what I was told when I was just in fourth grade third grade at the time\nIt does make sense to you know why they did that\nOh yeah totally yeah yeah I can just imagine yeah no I mean even with dad I'm Sorry I was still very heartbroken and\nUm I remember the last day of school back in Mexico and I would just say bye to everybody all come back soon um and I remember just cry and that very day before we made the trip here that you know if it was just very emotional and just very hard\nFor her new yeah yeah right yeah ... Oh yes yes it was part of me like already kind of knew or felt that I wasn't gonna come back and it was just very sad you know my grandparents were still living there so it was hard to say bye to them um\nAnd then we just made the trip and uh yeah um [noise] and then once I was able to kinda like better understand the language the custom how how things worked here then it just became a lot easier for me just to adjust\nHow big is your family give to parents yeah both of my parents and the brother okay and so when we came here they probably didn't have a whole lot of they may not have known the answers right as far as what we were going to do when we got to\nNashville or whatever part of Tennessee it was yeah it they were envy may not have had that answer for you then huh\nYeah no no I I'm not sure like fully well was like there are planned them out I think as parents they're also trying to figure out what was going to be the best um decisions for the family um but uh we have family already here so they were able to help us out to like you know just gonna\nAdjust and understand how things were going I'm like kinda like just understanding like you know what um how how is the United states\nOh Sarah ... that's got to be a ... all those things that that family or are they the uncles earnings and all that kind of thing yeah yeah my aunts and uncles\nOkay so obviously they were huge as far as your integration into the United states and without them it would have been a completely different experience\nYeah no that's right because they also had kids around my age so they um [noise] we're there are also to just kind of like um\nWell one it was good to know though I have family here um 'cause I thought I was just going to be there by myself but it ... it was good to know like as a little kid to know you have a cousin that is here as around your age you can play with you can talk to and\nUh for for them to us to show you kind of like how things work their ass as a student or assess my care right\nAt ... I was going to end did they do they spend all or do they only speak English won't was their background\nOh both so I think also they speak both languages but er but the preference was um English just because that is what they use the most ... also from a cousins who was a just mainly English at this book was ... I mean they spoke um\nGood Spanish we understood each other but obviously when you're using a woman which more than the other you would probably prefer to speak to their language they are more used to it\nWhen you think back to those days where there is in third and fourth grade or even going on in the middle school and through high school and you think of all the things that that help\nThat they helped without family in your experience here how much of that plays into the reasons why you are with ... with the organization now\n[noise] yeah well I think um it put a big role I'm\n... I wouldn't say necessarily with that with my aunts and uncles I think um when I started to see and like sort of the issues that the that the immigrant community was facing one of them was big on on the part of um being undocumented\nSo those experiences or say or had the lead to a lot of the reason why he has been involved with the Tennessee immigrant and refugee rights coalition when we come back we'll talk about some of the things that he has been dealing with\nMost recently and some of the events that will be coming up in the coming days\nYou could possibly be part of [noise]\nI'm Robert Bly and your tuned in to the Tennessee radio network [noise]\nIn Tennessee\nMatters I'm Robert want if you miss the earlier part of our conversation or just this morning and say are about ... he's with an organization called the Tennessee immigrant and refugee rights coalition we were talking about you as a young child and when you had moved here and some of the struggles that\nHad happened when you were a young child\nThose weren't the end of those struggles low even to get you to where you are now right\nCorrect yes very slowly as I was going through middle school and high school especially in high school that's when it kinda hits you more\nAs a high schooler I'm being undocumented you don't fully understand sort of how that's going to win back you\nUm and so um it happened when for example when I was trying to get my license and I couldn't get my license because documented and at the time I was okay I can always have for rides for parents and friends but then you get older like no I actually needed a driver I I that's a necessity here\nAre right there's not like a lot of public transportation that goes all the way out there and so\nHighly suffered issue with no ... yeah yeah\nEspecially at the time since ... naturalist they'll girl and so that was probably the first and back when you when you see that okay this is what it means to be undocumented that you're limited to things um and uh when I graduated from high school the question was I graduated high school and stuff from seven\nSo at the time the question was not so much do I want to go to college or not the question was\nWhat colleges know how to work with an undocumented students\nUm 'cause we didn't know that right we didn't even know of undocumented students could even go to college and so that was also another challenge I kinda felt like my life stopped there for a minute after high school and I didn't know where what direction I was gonna go\nUh but I found out that uh you can roll into college um I and ... seconds a barrier that can wrap that was that you can ... you can enroll in college\nBut you have to pay a the out of state tuition rates and that is just simply because of your immigration status and that made it also difficult to try to finish college because I'm here in Tennessee undocumented students have to pay three times more to go to college and that's because of their status of for an example um [noise]\nIf someone wanted to go to let's say I went to volunteer stay community college which is in Galveston and at the time um I think\nOut of state tuition rates for a one year I was paying ten thousand dollars and um and this was money coming from my mom and my dad and me working all three of us combined to try to pay that tuition fee 'em and other students um or\nPan or maybe a third of the ...\nMaybe four thousand dollars in it like\nAnimals per year and and and the difference was just simply because uh because of the immigration status or which makes it really hard and difficult to um attend college and just let alone graduate I ended up\nI'm dropping out a voluntary stay community college and just because that was we couldn't continue paying the uh that amounts\nUm and so I I wanted to get some sort of education so after that um I enrolled into a technical school um which they I wanted to go into medicine and they had a medical assistant program so I wanted to go into that at least have something I Want to feel like I accomplished something\nAnd so I graduated from a technical school here in Nashville is a medical assistant but then the third or the or the next\nObstacle was that um because all of a because I wasn't documented\nI could not find a job and the career that I chose and when I graduated I remembered that I'm ... wanted me to hire wanting to hire me to work there but I couldn't take the job because\nI'll still undocumented to all those different barriers um students still face on documents instill face here in Tennessee\nUm education is one of the big ones I'm for it and and so um once I got like a better understanding and just little by little just kind of learning more like what does it mean to be involved in the immigrant rights movement here in Tennessee I got to learn more\nIssues that others students were facing not just education right it wasn't until too often twelve\nThat an executive order was done through President Obama at the time that would allow on certain undocumented students\nThat came to the country at a certain age and have been here for some time there would be able to um get a a work permit a then after that apply for Social Security number and therefore could continue than what they studied or find a better job of that program is called DACA deferred action for
