premium off and it doesn't cost me anything and I know how can you know I'm Sorry it has a cash value in it right that three thousand dollars\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums are right now that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nI\nChose not also they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nBut if they get and\nYou know it's hot sorry yes my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight which I like it you know policy that race\nAnd you know I Know and when you die you know what happens is the three dollars in dollars they're going to keep\nIt all going to keep\nIt so how is this good idea there's no way this is a good idea site show you do whatever you want to hunting but those policies are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have a big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either maps on the line and Los Angeles I'm Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous ... thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nSo um my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife my bottom on about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were I did not include property taxes all modern association and be insurance as part of the payment to the bank ideal all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away\nA property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance away no but most people as you know we're paying that is one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from\nBeing house for okay where they got a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started here about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and the numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but account twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand lap and get a job and then we are looking actually refinanced he threw a fit in a long while but that\nCan ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen minute will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape her right now you got to clean up\nTo show the dad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand dollar income take home pay ... and ... and a four thousand dollar house payment and wondering why they're broke\nYou know Hitler the whole the whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the ah and I'm not saying you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I I'm saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just not be house pour that's all it is this kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fine tune numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in\nJackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you how are you\nI deserve what's up\nOkay\nI'll just start off really quick I Am twenty seven years old\nI had a um a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand or that's including my mortgage and and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house or to save up and buy 'em or at least\nSave up for the down or if it would be more ideal pet say about\nHis continued can take ... say they want sweets complete every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I Know and ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up in ... you\nKnow add on to this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical need a base didn't want to buy\nA house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would want to spend about twenty grand just enough to add on an extra brown just 'cause I work with children All right that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over ... for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and then my my part as a\nMother when is somebody I looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual\nFor them to be on your street right but you wouldn't want you want to come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it just Seventy plus Twenty years Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is uh about four hundred dollars\nYou know and your mortgage and all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and where you are now much of that his mortgage and how much of that other death\nAh there is only three thousand in that and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nAnd you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and show how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead free and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't do math myself but um I Know that we plan on eliminating the access that within the next line yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying the falling out plus I'm an extra fall now between the lower ...\nIf it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the addition done and you've paid cash for the addition is that okay\nUm well I mean that's where I'm kind of confused I just I Want to do with that\nBut I just started watching it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from\nToday is that an okay plan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I live\nGood parenting you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you\nPaid off everything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become debt free and then I Would say but but I had on the couch and do more than twenty thousand maturity a contractor Bijan everything down and you know what you're getting into\nA ... hour that Ramsey show in the book and we will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember and we only one way to financial ... daily\nBeast and groceries\nAnd\nHave cell phones we\nAverage age thirty eight years old fourteen years of work experience I'm nine years of management experience with these are people who are very season will have their own breath of knowledge to share with their contemporaries in the classroom\nIt's one of these things all of us we all have these thoughts these kind of Monday morning quarterback things or we we have these ideas in our mind well you know if I had done it this way instead or if I could go back I probably would have done it that way\nAnd this is sort of that ah maybe that there are some folks that second chance to be something like that didn't exist let\nIt doesn't exist I think that's one of the things I take away from this\nThat's exactly right we find that people of all ages I mean that the one thing different about that executive m._b._a. experience\nIt certainly is designed for the person that's a little bit further along in their career but how far along doesn't matter so we have individuals who've come back into the classroom that might even be\nYou know Thirty years of work experience and you might ask why would someone with Thirty years of work experience\nConsider going back to get a master's degree\nAnd if the exactly the point that we started with lifelong learning resident there isn't it you can't put a an age on it that you're sixty or you're done at fifty whatever that at age might be for you\nWhat we find is people are hungry in this competitive global business environment that we find ourselves and do anything they can to shore up their set of skills\nAs they bring them back to either their own at a price if they're an entrepreneur or to a a business that they work for a large corporation\nIf you're just joining us Michael ... is the executive director I'm the executive\nMBA counsel Michael one of the things that to me that I I think of when I hear about this program I think I'm a ... ... perhaps\n... or they're getting the opportunity to participate in the program and it's something that the current company's not know companies are this way but some of them are are\nI guess not just willing to uh you know the shoulder part of the the cost that's involved for them to go get this degree some of these companies want to sit down their employees do there's somebody looking at this correctly\nIt is true it's all over the you know the math so to speak in other words some employers will look at it and say we're happy to invest in you fully others will say you know what we want you to have some skin and again we want you to partially invest in it as well and then we have some\nOf that it won't and say hey listen you own your professional development\nYou control your degree your your career\nSo for example we track or this or the statutory closely Robert\nDoing about twenty percent of students in the classroom or the full tuition reimbursement from their employer about thirty four percent I'm rounding receive partial tuition reimbursement they're sharing that investment and they were like forty six percent will fully invested in themselves meaning don't pay the full right so\nSo you had all kinds of different experiences all kinds of different uh I guess incentives and whether they have some\nFull bore no incentive from the company that they're currently working with I think that um you just leave it certainly opens things up even if you're on in that group where you're not getting any of that or a ... that company backed sponsorship so to speak\nThat definitely makes it possible for you to look beyond that and not feel like you're it's a golden handcuff or anything like that\nYeah it certainly bears individuals to say you know what I could get reimbursement but I Choose to do it on my own maybe I'm thinking of starting my own business and two years after I complete this program so I don't want to have that sort of obligation or the feel\nOf an obligation back to an employer but one thing we we sometimes neglect to realize that even one employer isn't reimbursing financial aid they are supporting the fact that you're going back to school so in some cases\nYou know you're you're still doing your full time job but they're giving you access act to department that may I Need to participate in a project for school for you so there's other ways that employers have actually talking strictly financial certainly I we do see the large majority of\nYeah I suppose a lot of what we're talking about some of it\nIs just a I guess you know is national cybersecurity month so obviously a big part of the reason we were able to talk today is to create more awareness about these particular issues about some of these particular schemes and scams that are\n... that are taking advantage of people so we're doing our part of that here but what as far as some of the maybe some other perhaps proactive measures that our listeners are today are thinking to themselves oh what else can I be doing what are some of those\nThings is is that uh you know you just mentioned a couple of them but what give us some more tips are\nWell I think some of you know one of the easy things to do is is see if your bank offers fraud alerts almost all banks offered the capability to\nHow you win a transaction above a certain dollar limit as a curve and so you can say every time I spend more than two hundred fifty dollars you get a text alert and that way you know someone's hacking into your account or spending money that's not you know immediately the other big recommendation that I like to give the use of multi factor authentication felt complex but it's really not\nJust like you got to use your name and password to log in you sign up for this multi factor if on occasion and basically your bank will send a text your mobile phone every time you log in and you'd get a code in that ... and it's basically a second password for you\nAnd so like I said someone might be able to piece together your cyber identity might be able to piece together username and password for your bank what effects do on your phone and they can get to that packs they're not going to be able to log on and so really provides a fucking layer of protection for you\nAnd as one of them more foolproof ways you can to protect your account uses for your bank and even a lot of like Gmail for example offers it as a service where your email\nHow's that for irony is what you're talking about in some people's minds they're hearing well ... ... you know these these these secondary a you know an identifications they're thinking well it's it's sort of inconvenient it's another step and I feel like I don't have to take yet at the same time you try and prevent\nTo prevent those uh those unnecessary inconveniences that can come when you don't do that\nOr I had that exact conversation with my wife or their slander multi factor if on occasions like I hate that I don't want my phone when I log in\nBut you know what happened to someone hacked into your email I think everything that they have extra few they hack into your bank account because they pieced together username and password and they feel all your money or your bank gonna make you whole because there was fraud there was a crude against you\nBut it's still a lot of time and effort or you're going to have to go through to fix that when you know if you just have to have your cell phone with you when you log in that seems like a small price to pay\nThere are a lot of other uh tips in ideas and things that people should keep in mind working our listeners go to find out more about everything we're talking about today\n... near and dear to our hearts so I you know I Would recommend that go to a B. A. dot com slash consumers we've got a lot of tips from there on\nA ways to keep your money safe way to keep you safe in cyberspace and and we hope people take a chance to look at it\nFrom the American Bankers Association Paul bender joining us this morning thanks were hanging out with this [noise]\nNo thank you Robert ...
