what ... what is twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension annuity for security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do\nMoney and we can with\nUs you tuned into Tennessee matters I'm Robert one there are a lot of folks beyond the state of Tennessee of course that are trying to keep our teens safe\nBehind the wheel that's part of what we're talking about today with someone from right here in the mid state who has spent a whole lot of time on that particular cause she is a program manager over ... for a program that has called me in the zone\nFor neeman Mooney joins us on the phone this morning ... good morning to you how are you good morning I'm great how are you doing All right now just want to make sure that I get everything right there is a introduced you about what your what you knew\nAbsolutely got ... you know hit the nail on the hat oh goodness that's ... that's great I got a right for a while [laughter] that's fantastic but I was brought to you you were brought to my attention from\nCalled for driving skills for life and and something that uh that that they do that to recognize you and your efforts can you tell us a little bit about that program\nHere um so our program here at Monroe killed you and your children's hospital Vanderbilt is called the end zone\nAnd its emphasis is really on distracted driving um and it's a unique hospital school collaboration to educate our teen drivers about the dangers of texting and driving\nSo we were actually on our by um for driving skills for life because we lost this the end his own program in twenty eleven so we had a long run with it and a lot of success and and so they've on it to kind of celebrate us and what we've done\n'em and invited us to Washington DC and in in um you know recognize me as an unsung hero of highly safety\nI was just a God you said that because I wanted to make sure that it was it was pointed out you are one of six people in the entire country\nThat is being recognized for for your efforts obviously a lot of people in their efforts go into putting together a program like yeah but the it is a ... it is something that they're recognizing you for it and this this this particular event that's taking place so congratulations on that part but we're talking about that and\nThe the ongoing I guess yeah it's a it's a struggle to to try to\nMake sure that our team stay as safe as possible especially I mean as as as the phones get better and brighter and prettier and faster so to do the possibilities of genes being distract me the dogs are distracted enough let alone\nYou know the kids that are just in their first and second years of driving\nCorrect and you know that's a huge issue because we actually are part of the pediatric trauma injury prevention program at the hospital and one of the things we do is we try to develop programs based on what we're seeing with regards to trauma admissions\nAnd motor vehicle crashes among teens are actually the second leading cause of trauma admission to our hospital and we absolutely knew that we have to do something and and that was kind of\nUm the starting point for our being his own turn off your phone program on phones are attempting like you said\nUm you you know you have to figure out ways of really emphasizing among the youth the importance of putting all your phone on especially among those new drivers multitasking is something we all think we can do\nBut we don't do it efficiently so um the idea behind the program is really to generate interest get momentum going and really getting the teams to be the voice for change\nCan you talk a little bit about that you mentioned that you said it's the second most prevalent reason the did you see for for admission is that right\nYeah the second leading cause of trauma admission until our hospital and and you know it's it's staggering because\nWe really want to look at all the areas of concern all the kids who are coming in and what we try and do is say what are our top ten reasons for trauma admissions um and being a pediatric facility we focus on children I'm Seventeen and younger\nAnd we know and they look at that data and analyze that that our our teams who are coming up as our number one cause of admission that fourteen to Seventeen your age group and it was all related to driving um so we knew we had to make a change and we knew we had to do something and and this is our way to kind of address it\nWhen you develop a program like this ... thoughts as far as\nHow to get the word out obviously to have something like this\nBe successful and and and and get participants and how to be known let alone getting the message out to the the target audience of who you're you're trying to talk to what did you do as far as who you brought in to to try to\nGet on board with the program and what is it to develop into over the years\nYeah so we started the program in twenty eleven and interestingly it started off as a you know a very small or a pilot program we just use use that were coming into the hospital as part of\nA volunteer program that we have here and when we ran this hospital based program which is kind of a five hour program within the hospital talking to them about everything that can happen and the result of distracted driving they get to see a simulation in the eighty we simulate injuries on them that if it if they weren't a crash how it would look like\nAnd interestingly when we looked at evaluations that we asked the teens you know what do you think of their program and they said it's awesome but how do you get it out to our peers in schools\nHow do they hear about it um so what we do is it's really a grassroots movement we reach out to our what we call our counties of concern those are the county's at least the kids coming in from and we get that data from our trauma admissions\nUm any leased out to the schools and the principles and said you know like we want a partnership and we want to make sure that your kids are safe\nUm and so we start recruiting from really the the high school level reaching out to these individual counties and and then what happened now as we partner with um different Clemens within the high school so um health occupation club the essay the future farmers of you know that that speech farmers of America club\nOn the deck of clubs which is a marketing club and we get those students to kind of coming to our hospital we run a six hour program with them I'm On talk to them about what can happen as a result of a crash and then we have them go out and to their own county to schools and run a year long anti texting while driving campaign\nSo it's really motivating the IRS to make a difference within their own community and counting\nThe trauma that happen from the result of distracted driving in a lot of sensors and at least in my mind I'm thinking of different examples whenever we're we have you on our show we talked to all kinds of folks for for different causes but something like ... whether it's a a cancer or some kind of disease where\nPeople think that\nIt's the type of thing that happened to other people only right and that's where this is yet at the same time\nThe difference between the you know any type of disease and and this kind of epidemic this is completely preventable\nOh absolutely you know this is absolutely perfect you're saying that because that's what we try to reiterate that your actions make a whole lot of difference in this case you can make a difference and not just your own life but someone else's life\nUm and what we try to do in this program is really get people who've been impacted as a result of a motor vehicle crash come and talk to the teams\nSo it could be someone that lost their child because of the motor vehicle crash and we have another um adult come in who actually\nHad to go through several surgeries as a result of a crash that you know her boyfriend was involved with he was feeding when she got into Iraq and she's called American Child and men developed because he's gone through so many surgeries\nAnd they see that first hand that you know how your actions can influence not just your own life but also someone else's life you know so I always say this has a ripple effect it's not just hurts\nYou but it hurts multiple people within the community as well so limits possible for actions um and you know we often often say that driving is a as a privilege um some make use of that a privilege wisely you know\nHow much of the challenge involved here has to do with ... there's probably some kind of term for it but I'll just call it an invincibility factor or just maybe you can just I mean I I remember when I was in high school I knew everything to right\nYeah yeah Oh absolutely and I and I think that's why we tried to not just um get them to do it within their school but we bring them into the hospital because we actually want\nThem to feel what it's like to be having a head injury where you can't see and you have a concussion or have to wear the color or have to be in that ...\nWant them to feel how their everyday life can be influenced because of one simple mistake or one phone call that they love that\nWe want them to go to the eighty and said well you know maybe look down at the phone for a second but look what happened to little Johnny you didn't see him come out in the state and you know hit him that this is what can happen and Vina those services kind of involved in making sure that he doesn't lose his life [noise]\nUm so you know that invincibility that teens often feel hopefully through this program they are getting a look at how it's not really true um all of us can be part of this huge problem and you know things can happen in a blink of an eye\nHow much of the success of this has to do with just adults that are around these teams that are you mean the monkey see monkey do right and I'm as guilty as anybody of of probably looking at my phone too many times the adult influence really has to be something that I I Would think can't be\nForty eight thousand dollars to over a hundred thousand dollars per year\nHowever looking at Tennessee uh it's on the the lower side it can be forty three thousand dollars to eighty two thousand and the difference here\nIs whether one receives care in the home or they're going outside but our website ... dot com slash cost of care has an interactive calculator that actually covers twelve areas within the tendency\nOf the state of Tennessee So individuals can take a look and see what is the cost of care in my backyard but also if I were to look across the country and other areas you know what that costs maybe\nDid you find any correlation beyond just what I Am I presume is those costs are are are I guess they're probably can grow with just standard cost of living as the rankings might go state to state\nThat's right and there are many similarities when it comes to cost of living but at the other thing is that supply and demand equation and as you look across the United states it's a matter of what is the labor availability like within a given locale\nFor caregivers to come in the home or the amount and the demand for care outside the home such as assisted living\nIn nursing homes and what we're seeing is that what Tennessee is it good news story because on the cost side is certainly on the lower as a matter of fact for home care in the state of Tennessee versus the United states national average uh they're about number eight to number seven as far as on the lower side\nA rank distribution for the entire us whereas within nursing home it's about uh the eleven or twelve spots when you compare against all fifty states tendency is definitely in a good place when it comes to looking at\nHim planning a where I'd like to be and also what type of care\nLike to receive talking about that and and just as I mentioned earlier as far as this growing demographic of senior Americans and and knowing that this was going to be something that we were going to be experiencing\nCome this this year anyway has the amount of services increased to the point that it is going to be able to service that anticipated increase in the demographic ... gone up ... certainly\nAbsolutely we are seeing we believe that you know the demand for care is certainly an increasing as demonstrated by the increase in the cost of care and as we look at the research it's indicating that people are living longer lives and that's a good news story\nHowever people are waiting longer to receive care and as a result of that waiting longer\nRequires greater hands on care if you will to that places a strain on the demand and the resources available to provide that type of care and there's numerous other factors that start to compete with\nThe ability to attract a good quality caregiver to come into our homes\nCan you talk to us about the dynamic ... would that would be involved in some of these proposed Social Security cuts take place in some of the national budgets that are being proposed I can see it either way where they would have a a a a an impact on that that that's probably\nPretty a pretty it's pretty significant across the board I can see where if it impacts everybody equally that maybe it's a it's still going to be just as great a concern as it is now what what you read on how that may be a variable here\nI don't have the details when it comes to that the state programs and how the federal decisions will affect the cost of care that type of care that will be provided it certainly will be impacts\nBecause that is one of the options that people obviously have to rely on when it comes to long term care\nAnd when it comes to the state and federal programs there are regulations you know specifically with Medicaid it's based on income and they practically have to be a bankrupt or insolvent and so it really gets down to\nA vote that are in in the middle a who haven't saved or or necessarily don't qualify to to be on these programs you know how they're impacted being stuck in the middle but to your point\nAny kind of government changes could potentially impact the future of care funding\nHow is the industry changed in this time that even just over the scope of\nThe Fifteen Years since you've been doing this whether it's looking at different ways to approach the industry overall be at the the age demographic maybe it's you start looking at it at an earlier age as far as\nWhen they went when Americans might be integrated into to where we think of is senior programs maybe it's\nJust a ... the fact that some of these programs are more comprehensive with ... with with services that maybe weren't even thought of\nFifteen Years ago what has changed as far as what the what the industry looks like today\nI Would say what's what's changed is people are starting to recognize that\nThe various options that they've relied on in the past are not necessarily going to be there for them and the future and we're also seeing this in our own retirement savings in our own personal situations\nBut over the past Fifteen Years what we've seen as it relates to cost\nIs that the nursing home and the assisted living the out of home care has continually increased at a rather consistent pace ah roughly around the three point eight percent range three and a half to three point eight but home care to have somebody come into my home\nThat's for that starting to pick up quicker pace\nAnd it has accelerated over the past two years and we believe\nThat within the industry and we're going to continue to see a greater demand\nFor care in the home and it general wars we see this with our own claims where our policy holders a start to receive care in their home and of course that's where people want to be and the good news about home care\nIt's certainly more affordable than looking at outside of the homes are just facilities a nursing home or assisted living\nFor our listeners wanted to see more of the information that you're able to to reveal through this uh particular report working they go on line to to learn about that or just everything we've been talking about in general\nYeah it's on our website which is ... dot com slash cost of care and there is an interactive tool that allows you to calculate current cost compare cost across the nation but there's also the ability to project what potentially could cost be in the future\nSo I'm planning for my own needs I can have an idea of what that may look like and we really start to have the conversation about how would I like to receive care or better yet it buys a family member\nGordon Saunders joining us this morning thanks so much for your time [noise]\nThank you I appreciate it have a great day Robert and Robert want him to the radio [noise]\nWith us You're tuned into Tennessee matters\nI'm Robert won of course one of the things we've talked about from time to time is the issue of hunger and\nAs we get closer to the holiday season that seems to be a topic that takes on a little more attention\nMaybe that should always be the case that it takes this time of year for that to be a topic of concern we'll talk about that in greater detail with a guest who's joining us on the phone right now she's the senior director of programs for an organization called why hunger that's Allison calling Alison good morning to you how are you\nGood morning I'm very well thank you know let's say it's lovely to be here\nThis it's been part of a week every year kind of like the closer of this week that's been going on for these events and it started off on Tuesday with world food they tell us a little bit about what's been going on here\nSure the world today um it was established by the end I'm In particular the food and agriculture organization at their twenty in general conference in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty
