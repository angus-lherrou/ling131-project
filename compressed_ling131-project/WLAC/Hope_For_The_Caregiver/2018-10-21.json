C. K. E. N. Z. I. E.\nDay we give patients an E. mail format of this a physical therapist showing you exactly how to do these exercises\nWhat they're going to start doing is rocking that disk back and forth okay we're taking pressure off the nerve at home afterwards justice in ... in the clinic the more you can do this now this is going to hurt in the beginning it really is so Williams in ...\nBeginning it's going to be better for chronic pain McKinsey are going to be better to stabilize this long term okay once you're out of that issue okay even if you have a spring strain injury and low back maybe you were in a car accident\nOkay look at it and maybe your insurance can pay for all of your care but the fact is that once you're out of that spring strain injury the next progression after Williams' McKenzie\nIs into a bug series OK okay this is what I call them everybody calls him a little different like that but you're bug series is where you're on all fours OK these are yoga move for the most part okay so you're on all fours\nAnd what you're doing is you're taking one leg and you're putting it straight up behind you and you're lifting it up into the air\nThese look like donkey kicks for the most part you can picture yourself doing this on all fours me on the floor hands on the floor and you're taking that one leg and you're picking it up in the air on time and you're strengthening and moving one you're pumping fluids in and out of that disk\nAnd two is that all of those muscles that are completely ... up around that low back is you're starting to activate\nI'm now you're getting your groups involved and you're giving your pelvic stabilizers involved so you're going to do about eight on each side so right leg and then you're left leg and then once you're better at that\nThen you can do what's called pointers your bird dogs for the most part okay so now you're still on all fours game and you're going to lift your right arm straight out in front of you and you're gonna lift your left leg straight out in front of you who came so I Know a lot of\nLike look especially guys are listening to this right now going I'm not doing that\nI'm not going to yoga class I'm not doing this stuff\nAnd I'm here to tell you guys I'm a big dude I played college football I played a little professional football I have a fracture in my lumbar spine that affected my desk\nGuy from years of football over time like that and I do these exercises nearly every single day because this is what keeps my core strong this is what keeps my low back going I get my maintenance adjustments I get my maintenance chiropractic care to make sure that the disheartening generating\nAnd at the bones are moving properly and then I work on the muscle groups around that\nGay so he's your bird dog so right or left leg at the same exact time and then you come back down and you go left arm right leg at the same exact time\nSo to start when the beginning when it so bad you got your Williams exercises and your McKinsey exercises\nAnd then the next progression from it is you're dead bugs and time again so you're on all fours one leg at a time first that you can go straight out\nAnd then you can go to the side lifting that leg on either side okay these are going to be uncomfortable when you're in pain okay so that's why in our clinic what we do is we have the patience to do them for us in front of us\nSo when they come in with low back problems we take 'em through the process they're reading these completely exam or getting consul they're getting the specialized motion X rays so we know exactly\nWhere the problem is and exactly what discuss bother and exactly what nervous pinch and exactly what exercises in treatment you need for that\nGuy okay you don't need surgery and not everybody needs the same exact treatment but the fact is was that much we can identify that we can start the process and what healing of cars these patients are out of pain and they know what to do outside of the office to keep this from coming back\nOr re injury rate is extremely low and they don't have to have surgery\nThe number one thing I hear when a forty year old person comes into my clinic and they say my low back some balmy for four years and I'm a great one to take you four years to get it looked at\nAnd they say it's to the point now where I Am scared that I'm going to have surgery guys if that is you right now I Am here to tell you that what we do\nHelps and it will fix that you are the person that I'm Talking to right now\nSo you can give us a call ... we've got going and we've been talking about it all show is if you suffer from really bad low back issues even if you've been to a chiropractor before maybe you had any more I maybe you've had cortisone injections maybe you've had all this stuff but the fact is is that you've got so much competition so much the generation that you've been told you have to have surgery\nGarrett's when you come into our office we got six of our ... ... for appointments last now like that it's ... it's forty dollars we do the specialized exam\nThe motion study X rays I go over at all with you and I lay out a plan for you to get it fixed and it is the best deal going right now\nThat all costs you forty dollars and that there is nothing like it out here so if you come in and you say I don't believe in

people live to see everything behind the curtain aren't you\nWell know numbers are [laughter] yeah we took out those you know they get pictures [laughter] um you can thank me later [laughter] you know we um\nWe have not less is battle with addiction um I guess was an open secret to the people closest to us in our lives\nAnd so and that means family as well as friends and support group and um so it in some ways people it's news to a lot of people but it's not it's very very old and his who was um he was diagnosed when he was about\nThirty I think and I'm so there were periods of sobriety that lasted up to ten years at a time um but then there would be a relapse and and subsequent\nTreatment and um so it it feels it sounds I think a lot more daring than it is um well well into another decade past dubbed recovery and so\nIt doesn't feel as scary as maybe it should be asked me October thirty first\n[laughter] well let me let me ask you a couple of questions when did this become Russia's issue\nOr what did what did you change from just being an issue the Russians to struggle was to produce you that you and then your family had to struggle with was there a defining moment for that when you realize okay this is not just us this not just runs this is us\nRight um well\nOne thing you have to understand is that Russia's learned literally at his father's knee how to hide or less a father was a Pentecostal minister small small church mostly family and farmers still California and he was also an alcoholic I'm\nHe never received treatment he never had any extended period of sobriety um he would sort of I guess white knuckle it\nUntil something would hit them over and and and he would drink and and so ... grew up with that and it because it was such a small church there was a lot of hiding and a lot of covering up\nUm when rush started drinking and he really didn't even have any at all until I think he was like twenty six years old as soon as he started drinking interestingly enough he as soon as alcohol was introduced into his life\nHe started drinking alcoholic Lee and hiding it\nSo I'm\nThe first big a realization was well it was um I I keep thinking it was around when he was thirty I I'm I'm a still a little fuzzy one of the things trauma does to you is that you'll lose\nKind of some um sense of time sometimes but as soon as\nAs he was hiding and sneaking in hiding and so by the time I realized wait a minute there's something going on here and a family and other family member um had confronted him it was [laughter] it it became a it involves me as soon as I knew we had a problem", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hope For The Caregiver", "city": "Nashville", "day": "21"}
