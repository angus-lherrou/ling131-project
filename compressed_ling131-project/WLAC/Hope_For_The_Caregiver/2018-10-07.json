{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "And a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is that free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you Bob usually done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement as baby steps for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off I'll surely so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that's non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nOh that's correct and you know eighty on your house did you say is that right yup okay and um the uh the way I look at that is if you owed thirty thousand bucks on your house would you go borrow\nThousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no yeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets in a column of your liabilities and boy you own and what you owe\nCalled a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect as if you had borrowed on your home to buy those stocks\nDesigned by the way if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to\nThree to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick I might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency fun\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nA it's on there were about a hundred and ...\n... ... only ... years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nIt'd be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd I think you know what else will happen is did you do remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nUh yeah kind of ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when you did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years and\nYeah that's what I'm Talking about that because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the lender that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\n... no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're\nInvesting it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both that both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean you mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd you make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would catch all the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nOr that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within you know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes\nAnd then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper\nYou are on your way sir honor to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWill thank you ... help today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and uh we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans which we're working on and then we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her\nFirst child and April so hey we take your advice and stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank you know all of that is good\nAnd ah as a ... month we we now have enough for her to take her for a month maternity leave um pain for you for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem that the Murphy has decided to strike at\nThat last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a with a baby on the way here and another a few months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so\nMy question is um what would you do it in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do when somebody do\nA better than the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that will usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe becomes pile up occasionally when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your debt\nCorrect as long as baby mama come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much cash if you've got piled up or will you have piled up by ... ...\n... Seventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she is knowing that you're wanting to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we were smart about this and it set that goal to make\nSure that now so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much I'm\nJust about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have and then um other than our car payments and you have actual that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not on your car in Montreal your car alley [laughter]\nOn and on the dollars sometimes well then the four thousand will be you're you're paying off out of this guy and then as far as set aside enough for her to say was re month so\nYou got the cash you should\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash show\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement\nThat's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\nFrom the bombing in front of this is talk radio not weigh three hundred and Fifteen to end\nNashville\nHis first day on the bench I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News justice Brett Kavanaugh takes his seat on the Supreme Court Tuesday following a bitter confirmation battle\nVote to confirm Kavanaugh was narrow in Democrats like Senator Mazie Hirono\nBut this one thing I did as well eat the stuff back well I've I've also learned that um you are entitled to your your your own feelings you're entitled to your own perspective you're not entitled to your own facts\nBut you are entitled to have your own feelings and they are valid feelings but to try to force someone else to validate how you feel is always going to leave you coming up\nAnd Alex's Bush came on and said and I am not kidding it really said this\nTo be honest it's been a pretty rough day [laughter]\nAnd she wouldn't say Gracie because it get great she turned back although his you know but but you we listen to a different devices but you know radio is still there and that's why I chose to do this this show like this\nRadio is different from television because you get to build a much different relationship with the audience on radio\nAbsolutely and in caregivers often are restricted in the amount of time that they have per day they have they have to be out or doing whatever you know you're going for Ron you're going right now you're tired but they're taking somebody to the hospital or go into something yourself or whatever\nUh and radio is one of those lovely things that can just uh have on and and not interfere with your day to day\nWell and for it and if you have to stop the middle of it

chop up the interview sometimes on the show just to make it easy because we know that caregivers are running busy and they're and they're all over the place but we try to make resources available and speaking of which for those you watch it on Facebook Live\nAnd you'll be able to see this those you watch it on radio [laughter] watching evil you got to say it but I'm a hold this up of the new book

redo the whole the bubble the up and you don't have to go through the whole thing before you get the nuggets of wisdom you you go through in in that wisdom is hard won by the way you you can just pick it up whatever you want turn right to a page you're going to find something there that will strengthen you but the seven land mines\nAre crippling caregivers they do I I I've hit every one of them
