we're putting legs on her fellow entities and you can be a part of the standing with hope dot coms and take a look and see what we've been doing but our caregiver tip of the day is\nPush back against the isolation push back against the isolation\nIsolation is one of the toughest issues that caregiver space and rub you know I've talked about that a lot I Want to secure the eldest among us [noise]\nAnd ah [laughter] so I got that going for me [laughter] which is nice [laughter] you remember that they'd run out of the ... yeah I got on your death bed you'll see a tried to Steffi [laughter] so ah let's see if you love you and I've talked about this many times\nAnd you've said one of the first things happen when when when ... was born ... isolation and and and what you guys felt with the isolation so talk about uh you know ... you said ... what kind of asked listen you talking about that\nIf you feel like when you when you have a problem like that many families at least we did we've got like we're the only people in the world that had that problem\nYou know we didn't know anybody else and I'm so that was the shock of it and you know dealing with it and and then uh we didn't feel like we're part of any kind of a community or get any help until we found the Kennedy Center over here\nWhich has many for kids with dancing around their kids a lot of other stuff too and in Jonah and then my daughter ... she went down there is a role model she was two journalists either for the longest time and we and you know it's like nobody can tell us anything we have many many\nThat this was in Nashville national yeah so [noise] do doctors came to you and said hey here's a\nMan when John was born I went to the doctor that delivered him\nAnd he always severe problems and I went to the doctor a few days later [noise]\nTold him I said I'm not sure what to do here and he said just take it home and love it it's such a genius tell them you know it yeah he didn't he knew nothing about he'd never delivered a child evidently with serious problem before then later on we we met the doctors had ... who was a high risk pregnancy doctors are wonderful\nBut then in between then we um we finally found the Kennedy Center\nOver ... bought it became part of ... and a and met other people that had kids with problems but deals in that it's you know\nSo when that isolation that you felt I mean you felt literally alone well we didn't know anybody that has serious physical and mental problems and and uh we didn't know anyone had any luck there now there's a lot of kids that are problems you'd never see him you know\nWhat we're ways that that you were able to push back against it or you\nWork actually you know I mean we thought about moving to California or something because I wouldn't really met country all that much at the time and she can't go we finally found hair ceiling so let me I didn't want any white Peter I didn't we didn't know\nLet me back up a little bit rubs been a longtime producer musician here in Nashville worked on I don't know how many records of Kenny Rogers rotting males to just to name a few\nAnd been doing this for years Greg has a long time songwriter musician been banned since the sixties in fact we were coming up here in Studio some see all these\nBans today with a their long hair and everything else I said the air and I said that looks like you're dead it Greg said no my hair was much longer [laughter] it was a different time there was a but it but so you are you are in the music business and you weren't that\nLocked into a country music passes so you're thinking about taking it on the road and go into LA was whether it be better\nMusic I was involved in my back then changed at ten years later but back in the sixties early seventies music I was involved in was more\nOr be rock pop up stuff at one country at all and uh I've thought about but we you know I never really thought\nThere might plans to move out to California and I'm Glad it didn't cause I'm southern boy born and bred but it's a um and then after Jonah and we've made some ties here in Nashville them without while we can't go where we are so blessed with what we did find between the Kennedy Center in ... and one thing or another but it was yeah when you first have a child like that man you\nKnow if you don't have anybody you know commiserate with and talk to and healthier than it is it's a it's tough I don't I don't I don't\nKnow I tell people man I wouldn't want to go through that again as hard the hard things that went through my life I wouldn't I wouldn't wish that on anybody but it in ... more than anything else\nIt may may put things in perspective the Jones left the ... and I was a it was tough love you back on it you know it it it just made you realize what a lot of things that are important in a lot of things that aren't important\nAnd it was a it was it was a huge blessing messed simple he lost a lot of people but it was a tough one\nWell Greg isolation same thing you had a you had a difficult diagnosis as well [noise]\nWell they didn't our doctor didn't say take it home but he used to in fact he said don't take him home just leave them with the state and and they will\nCare for him until he expires near and was born in the life expectancy of Down syndrome Chao was twenty five years [noise] see that a little bit closer to you when Aaron was born in the life expectancy of someone with Down syndrome and the United states was twenty five years\nAnd that's because ... parents were advised to take their children or take their babies leaving leave them with it at the state\nAnd not just the state of Minnesota where everyone was born but all the different states have heard this for many many uh parents\nThat air lean a little closer to the microphone to tell us what was your your just had a birthday and how old are you I Am forty years old forty years old\nAnd you have defied the odds haven't you yes I have well now the\nThe life expectancy for a someone born in the United states one in seven hundred babies is Down syndrome and the life expectancy of sixty and that much improved from twenty five to sixty in a forty year period\nIs because parents are no longer advice to ... to leave their babies with the states and with the government and they are cared for much better [noise]\nYou must have felt terribly alone as well\nAs we had no idea at ... we didn't know anyone with Down syndrome we didn't know anyone who uh was familiar with Down syndrome and we lived in a small town in Minnesota\nWhere the weather was not conducive to anyone with Down syndrome and so we moved to Nashville because of fear and you\nKnow why why why Nashville well because I was involved with the music business in Los Angeles before I moved to Minnesota I was still involved with it long distance and had friends who are moving here to Nashville at that time and I've also was raised with southern\nUh parents in southern I felt comfortable with Nashville with a and the weather in Nashville was much much better for Aaron\nPeter if if uh\nIf people in their fifties sixties and seventies could have children\nAnd had a Down syndrome child or or ... any kind of ... challenged anyway\nThere'd be a lot more uh where of it and and not shocked as much out of hand them over to you know you're Twenty years old twenty something how world you know you're just out of colleges and the whole world revolves around this and you don't know that how old were you in general is more um I was twenty nine twenty eight\nI was thirty one year and was born\nSo we you you were very very young very very alone did it did you have a good church situation around you\nKnow [noise]\n[noise] yes we did have a um\nI don't know about good but we did have a church situation around us and it and um [noise] but they didn't know how to react to it either no one no one knew what to tell us we're gonna we're gonna talk about this a little bit more this is a\nThis is hope for the caregiver\nAnd we're on a mission to punch against that isolation that's our caregiver tip of the day is to punch against that isolation that's why the show exist and we're glad you're with is eight hundred six eight eight Ninety five twenty two we'll be right\nAre little things we want to talk about his check your apps\nCheck your ass check your bills sometimes we forget that we'll leave things going and we're paying two dollars a year for dollars here you know uh the cable company is just keeps hiking things up and we don't bother to check and guess what we're just saving money just fly out the door\nAnd uh so if if if you got it and you don't care about it don't worry about it but if you need the bunny checked your apps on your phone because there's a little two dollar things will add up after well do the job they absolutely\nDo add up and another thing is even if it's not a something that as a subscription service or something like that if you're on a limited data plan if it's even if it's free if it's sucking up data and you don't use it you're renting out spending that money elsewhere as well and you don't need to be doing that so if it's if it's a useless crap if you're if you find that you haven't\nUh you know been using it in the last month or two maybe think about\nThe cable
