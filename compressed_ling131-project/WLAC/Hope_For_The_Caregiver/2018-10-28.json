{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Them and as we open up so many new patient appointments Tony to be exact at the beginning of every show we're down to about six we've got about ten minutes left in the hour right now so if you need us for anything give us a call for four or five seven seven zero one you can get us on line and acted this health center\nYou can find us on Facebook and accidents health center you'll see a big picture of my um\nMy face when when you go to the page but if you ever have any questions ask us guys or if you just want to come on in for your appointment yet what we offer his instead of two hundred and fifty bucks the radio slashed show that we offer each week\nIs forty dollars you're going to get a console you're gonna get a full exam you're going to get for motion study X rays that show is exactly what we can fix and what we can't\nAnd then I'll go with him give you the reporter findings and tell you what the proper course of care for you to be is no obligations no anything but if you want out of pain and you want off those meds you don't want surgery they give us a call for four or five seven seven zero one we're not in the office or you're going to get our answering service\nLever nine leave leave your name your phone number so we can reach you I'm In the email address I can send you a packet on 'em and it just sounds what part of the city you're coming from so we know how much time to a lot from me and we'll get you back ASAP\nThat's forty bucks is the best deal going ... you can't beat it for four or five seven seven zero one not the end of the last segment\nAgain I promise you exercises for you to do at\nHome [noise] guys and as a part of our CARE Package in the office not only is our goal to get you out of pain and it gets you off medications\nThe goal is to be able to\nTeach you what to do outside of here so it doesn't keep coming back\nSo every single patient our office and we see hundreds of people a day in our clinic down in Britain what it's just phenomenal we have kids running around everywhere it's a high energy environment yet but the fact is that we're giving them exercises to do at home I'm writing the prescriptions\n'em and exercises were sending them videos to do we're teaching them how to stretch and strengthen this so they can maintain their results long term so I'm going to go to a couple of the net exercises for you the first one hands down\n... is the most common problem we see is the Ford head posture we sit at a desk all day long and we said on the couch watching TV and overtime our heads slumps Ford off of our shoulders and that causes our shoulders to round in front of us\nSo we've got to start combating that so the first thing is is that we're going to take our arms up to our side and we're going to stretch 'em back as far as we possibly can you can do this on the wall is\nWell these are called patch or interior shoulder stretches where you going to put your hand on the wall and you're going to stretch the front part of your shoulders you pull away from it that has to loosen up in order for you to pull your head back the second part of that\nYou're going to take your chin level I don't want you looking up at the ceiling okay I Want you to take your ... and I want you to push it directly backwards until you're pushing your head back over your shoulders\nNow most of your trying this right now and it's probably very uncomfortable because those muscles and ligaments are so tight\nProbably from some arthritis or degeneration from being in that position for years and degenerating away but you just can't do it yet because so some of the programs that we specialize in is breaking up at the generation and getting your posture corrected the way you're supposed to\nAnother one is called wall angels okay for this one you're going to combine those two movements you're going to back up against a wall okay so I Want you to the back of your heels against the wall I Want your butt touching the wall and I want the back of your shoulders touching the wall one is that the back of your head\nShould also be touching the wall here okay so if you can't if your heads not touching the wall e immediately than I Need you to pull your head back don't look up at the ceiling as a matter of fact touch your chin down just a little bit and push your head straight back until it touches the wall\nI Want you to extend your arms out all the way to the side and then I Want you to try and slide your hands all the way up to the ceiling and until they touch over your head all while staying up against the wall\nAnd got now you go Dr impossible no that's\nActually exactly the way you are designed to move so if you can't do that maybe it's a shoulder maybe it's the neck in the board had posture but these are functional problems and if you cannot do that what that means is\nThat you're having some sort of degeneration your pinching nerves in the neck and it's leading to bad problems later on so this is one of the functional things that we have patients do to start with and then we give them strengthening things we teach them how to use bands at home but\nThese are all real simple probably the costs you like ten bucks to get at Walmart\nAnd you can go through the whole series we ride you prescriptions so our patients are coming in they come into our clinic and a correction done and we re X ray omen show where they're at and they feel fantastic and then we send them up on a plan for the next year\nFor maintenance case like what you're doing all of this at home okay the more you do at home the less I have to see you in the office it is a fifty fifty proposition\nThere's really only two groups of people that we can't help\nOne is that people that never show up [laughter] so if you're going to call in and say you know what I Want your help I Want this fix I Want I don't want surgery okay then you just kind of show up your appointments and you got to be able to show up and make it and do it and be committed and to the second person that we can't help\nLet's face it guys we all know this person is the person that doesn't want to do anything for themselves okay they come in and they say nope I Want you to do everything to me or for me and I'm not doing anything at home I'm not taking a supplement I'm not exercising I'm not doing any of your stretches I'm not doing everything\nWithin if that's the case we're only going to get X amount of results came so many places we've been taught that we go into the ER and they go here just take this\nGo home and there's no follow up to that there is no way they and they say come back if it gets bad again I don't want you coming back when it's bad again I Want to teach you how to prevent it from being bad\nGuy so if you want that didn't give us a call for four or five seven seven zero one\nFor four or five seven seven zero one guys we're down to about two spots left we got three minutes left and the show so for four or five seven seven zero one get your forty dollar console exam ... motion X rays\nAnd I guess when you get that you're going to get her answering service to leave your name your number will get back to the ASA pi let's see if you can't get off those men so let's see if you can't start driving again and I'm here to tell you know John came in\n... I'm going to pick on John for a minute because he's just got a phenomenal story\nJohn came into our office about three years ago maybe like that so he's been a patient ever since and our clinic so I can tell you now that he's doing phenomenally well he's off all of his medications he came in the office with to complaints one extremely high blood pressure\nHe was on two different blood pressure medications and his blood pressure was still one fifty over Ninety okay\nToo is that he had a herniated disc and the bottom part of his neck he's I guess not active\nAll the time but if I sleep wrong step wrong my with my grandchildren wrong can't go to the football games wrong eat dinner wrong like everything is you just got this list the stuff he can do so basically he has to walk on eggshells his entire life\nOtherwise the disc herniated disc pensions down on my nerves and he can't feel his hands um he can't go to sleep even cannot attend pain in his bat\nHis best friend had this final surgery to fuse it in his best friend got no results outta whatsoever so he doesn't want to do that\nSo he comes in and see us I think that called in to the radio show that we were doing at the time took our forty dollar offer that and we did the X rays and so John it's real simple but you've got a nasty whiplash injury that happened Twenty years ago that was never fix and it's just been degenerating and degenerate into generating for Twenty years\nSo here's how we're going to fix you okay so we put him on he got his chiropractic adjustments to take the pressure off the nerve\nWe set him up with an exercise program he did need some non surgical spinal decompression to take pressure off the nerves\nUm guys three months into his hair we reacts write him his posture gotten better his pain level he hadn't had a flare up since the second week of care he had no pain since then\nAnd his blood pressure was Dale so I'm not allowed to take you off your mad he goes back into his empty and says hey I Want to take half my medication the guy goes okay do whatever you want\nSo we give him some supplements and we teach them how to exercise right and he comes back in three months later and he goes I'm off my meds completely my blood pressure is one twenty eight over eighty two [noise] 'cause this is phenomenal\nAnd it's a a it's a bill ... legislation she doesn't normally do all this but what we've been talking about this and so she's called in about a particular piece of legislation I think she's going to try to join us for that as well\nMonths' ago they'll go into a little bit of intellect to the show [laughter] this is going to raise it up right away [laughter] um bus and maybe even entertainment value to [laughter] but now they are they're going to bring a a\nPowerful um discussion to this or that we want to do in this part of our journey here's as caregivers because these things are important for us to be involved and caregivers do vote I'm speaking of which I got an article that uh if you want to go out and take a look at it read it in the Memphis commercial appeal things coming picked up in several\nUm papers is well this week\nAnd it's cold it's not a blue wave it's not a red wave it's a great wave that's affecting so many families and then I got another one will be out of that thought about it I Am yeah [laughter] um and then I've got another one that will be coming or later on this week is will uh about broadband\nOr ... you know we've talked about that ... to learn how to fix I've got several op eds proponent of that sort of thing I mean well yeah and well one of the things I talk about this how this affects the family caregiver and it does\nSo uh we're we're way to get into that and then a just a little bit of note I'm going to British Columbia this week ...

I'm I'm just asking just check on me to just make sure everything's working I mean that's that's a great stewardship of each other to do that and and how much does that cost\nI mean really you know I mean we could always bring meals\nAnd meals are great but you know eventually somebody's gotta learn how to cook and if they don't have an oven that works properly you going to be bringing a lot of meals I see ... I mean told me silly\nGo ahead All right so [laughter] so anyway that's our that's our today's senior moment if you have a somebody the you know in your church uh widows or or you know what it was gonna say but widows and orphans so if you've got somebody in your church\nWho is living alone support what'd you just check on them check on their appliances check on the water heater check on the heating and air conditioning use or get a service like killer offers with their with their happy healer club [noise] and and they'll about four times a year but all the other stuff too microwave oven these little things it may not seem like much to you but to a caregiver [noise]\nBut the washer and dryer go down [noise]\nAnd you'll see a caregiver stress go up exponentially that's a way to help right now I eight hundred six eight eight Ninety five twenty to this is hope for the caregiver this is the nation's number one show for the family caregiver we're glad you're with us hope for the caregiver we'll be right back after the break with Johnny ... and I think she's going to join us as well and that's what's so\nDon't go away we'll be right back [noise]\nThat is a Johnny ... and taught a singing with my wife grace either both on the phone right\nNow good evening good afternoon lady's name Peter thanks for having me on the show well it's a pleasure to have both to start the Johnny with you listen we're going to get right to 'cause I Know you're playing for a big conference right now and I'm really\nYou should you go in the afternoon grocer you hang on for just a second I'm gonna get you just to say that I can talk to you anytime Bruce you know I've just got a little bit [laughter]\nJohnny you one of my favorite people in the whole wide world and you this is an issue that you are having some very serious conversations with nationally and uh we want to talk about Senate bill six Ninety three I'm just jump right in town and they talk about it what is it and why or why is this important\nWell virtually every disability advocate in my network as well as those involved an elder abuse\nAre deeply concerned about again Senate bill number six nine three I Want our listeners to write that down Senate bill six nine three now basically this bill will do two things\nIt'll pour a massive amount of taxpayer dollars into federal hospice programs including Medicare hospice programs\nPlus secondly that will be new and much more liberal hospitals education for those programs more relaxed a regulations as it were\nNow the reason I I Am against them disability advocates are against it and a senior advocates are against this bill it's because\nExisting federal hospice programs we all know\nAre planted by tremendous fraud or quality care rampant abuse and many sing murder and a gross waste of taxpayer dollars under Medicare hospice programs records show that staff administer high doses of unneeded medication so that\nTheir medical records contained documentation that justified billing Medicare for these expensive drugs have higher rates so I'm encouraging people to vote no on Senate bill number six nine three\nAnd a because again a massive amount of federal funding it's going to be important to a federal hospice program that is fraught with abuse\nOf patients who are not even terminally ill um when I talk about new regulations and a more liberal education\nBill um the new language in this bill does not require hospice patients to be terminally ill\nOr to receive lethal drugs dosage so that the store or a great concern to me and every difficulty advocate everything or advocate husband still not moved into a new committee in the Senate committee on health education labor and pensions and to us a no vote means no\nElder abuse it means no to\nUnnecessary suffering and death it means no check fraud waste and especially abuse so\nI'm hoping that my friends all of our friends who are tuned in today we'll call their senators right there senators\nEmail there senators and if you don't know what your senator is a in Congress men not just Google I'm your address and ask for your representative before Congress and you don't get all that information just\nHow your senator that that you want them to vote no\nOn the Senate building number six Ninety three let's not expanding funding for federal hospice programs until existing problems are resolved Congress just can't they must not throw good money after bad so basically Peter that's my campaign speech\nI Know you have many many many listeners care about these issues\nWill and and I I'm I'm listening to you're going to say let's get coverage not throw good money after bad and I'm thinking Johnny [laughter]\nThat's ... that's what they do they threw in after but [laughter] but I think this is an incredibly important topic you've written about this a lot I've written about some not on this particular bill Bennett written on some of these things\nAre but you've written quite a bit on this do is do what's a good place for people to go if they want to see some of the things that you put down and writing about articles you've done blog posts and so forth is just a a website\nAbout my website yes of course Johnny and friends dot org but I wrote a book earlier this year a cult when is it right to die\nAnd that's the question that we all wonder about when we deal with significant disability when we deal with life altering injuries are illnesses when we're taking care of an elderly parent who is suffering from dementia and we want to know when it's a right to ... how do I find that clear distinction between\nA promoting treatment which will extend my loved ones life significantly and that's a good thing\nTo encourage life or what am I promote a treatment that would be nothing more than ... along the process of\nDying [laughter] we all want to find that line next near distinction we want which didn't want guidance as to how to know when a person is is it's actually dying\nAnd when did they reaching treatment that well in the help their life to which they should be help so this book I think it's practical guidelines Peter and I thank you so much for giving us a solid\nThumbs up or as you have in the past and um people can find out about this book by just visiting Amazon dot com or Christian books dot com or they can visit Johnny and friends dot org\nI I Know great so your wife she's such a good friend of mine that's got some strong opinions about this as", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hope For The Caregiver", "city":
