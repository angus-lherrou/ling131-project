him a poll is just come out from NBC Marist\nNBC News and ... did this ball together found him with a two percentage point lead that's within the margin of error so forty six forty four\nMade while and New York times Sienna college poll conducted Tuesday evening has him tied or a head by one percentage point\nThe problem in Nevada is what happened when Sharron Angle last what was that two thousand twelve\nThe problem is [noise] [noise]\nJust like in South Texas or in Chicago there are going to be boxes that are going to come in late and it's going to be casino employees that's what you're up against you're up against the corrupt machine that plays for keeps\nAnd that worries me but if if Republicans can hold Arizona Nevada\nTennessee in Texas they keep the majority you you can you can write off the other races\nUm you know you've got some other opportunities to increase your majority and here's what you offset potential losses I Can't tell you right now the Republicans are going to win Arizona Nevada Tennessee in Texas\nI Can't tell you what went off all for I think we're going to win Texas pretty sure that and Tennessee and Arizona look better than ever the bottom of a toss up\nBut then you've got\nNorth Dakota where right now the challenger is leading Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat so that could be a Republican pick up that way if you lose Nevada balances you got Indiana with donnelley I think not only were probably still hold on [noise] you've\nGot Montana with tester the fact that Republicans can't win Montana just blows my mind you've got West Virginia with mentioned the problem is the mansion voted for Kavanaugh and I think that's going to tell Republicans their cars mansion is personally popular\nHe might be a Democrat but he's personally popular and I think there's some folks that are going to say well you know it doesn't hurt us to have a Democrat and when we really need him is with us\nAnd that drives me crazy but anyway you got Florida where Bill Nelson\nI mean we're going to see you know what happens with this storm a hurricane Michael this just hit those sorts of things happening right as an election occur always scares me\nBecause the

the beach\nHolding hands with Morocco bomb in announcing that Iraq Obama was the best president ever and because of Morocco bomb in New Jersey was going to be great and basically endorsing Barack Obama and given Obama a boost in the days just before the election\nAnd I'm not being too hard on Chris Christie because the Romney campaign had had problems with Chris Christie the entirety of that campaign including the fact that Chris Christie was still threatening to run until the very last minute because he's an ego maniac\nAnd Chris Christie may nicer Morocco bomber and you remember the story Obama was on a plane with Bruce Springsteen and they're making fun of Chris Christie and Obama talks Bruce Springsteen into calling Chris Christie\nAnd talk and nice to him for being so nice Obama so Chris Christie really handed up after that and later they made him the bottom of the joke\nBecause they both think he's a clown as I Do but the storm scare me in Florida is a state that Republicans really need to win win win back eight Democrats the course Marco Rubio CEO center there\nAnd then the last the is McCaskill in Missouri which we should have won with Todd Akin six years ago but Karl Rove decided he didn't want to win that seat if Republicans win Missouri over McCaskill that makes a potential loss in say Nevada\nThat that's a balance you got four states where Republicans are in trouble\nOr four states where Republicans are being challenged ethic Ted Cruz's pulling ahead so you take that went off the table I think that that Marsha Blackburn a pulling ahead so you can take that went off the table in ah Tennessee I think like Sally\nHas enough of a lead so you can take that often in Nevada as a problem so that means Republicans just need to win at least one\nOf North Dakota Indiana Montana West Virginia Florida [noise] for Missouri I like to change [noise]\nMichael very few okay to use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat as a rape or cry when did it become OK for
