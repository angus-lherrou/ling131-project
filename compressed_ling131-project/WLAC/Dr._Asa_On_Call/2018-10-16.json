{"year": "2018", "show_name": "Dr. Asa On Call", "day": "16", "month": "10", "state": "TN", "content": "Yeah [noise] to view the [noise]\nRather terrible storm storm damage there\nUm seeming to strike exactly\nThe right tone in his remarks in his actions it's mostly symbolic but you simply cannot let the media say\nThat you didn't pay attention\nYou have to do everything you can knowing that they're looking for some excuse why you did something wrong\nYou've got Florida's Republican governor Rick Scott going to great lengths\nTo make sure that they can't criticize him as not having done enough opening up the governor's mansion even for the state police officials officers who were there responding in assisting folks\n[noise] President Trump further commenting on Saudi Arabia if in fact it is determined that democracy Yogi was murdered and that that order was given by the Saudi Government\nWhat are your options let's say they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed\nWhat depends on what the section so give me an example [noise] they order a military weapons [noise] everybody in the world one of that order Russia wanted it China water that we wanted it when we got it so would you cut that off like\nWould I don't want to do [noise] rowing luck Cain race here and all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a\nShould they use the word that's a pretty harsh word but it's true [noise] however\nAnybody what's at stake here [laughter] you know they said well there's a lot\nTo say there's a lot at stake and [noise] maybe especially so because this man was a reporter to something you'll be surprised me say that if something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\n[noise] the media would love an announcement that the United states will not do business with Saudi Arabia premature though it would be when that is a major major economic partner\nThe media loves this sort of dramatic action sort of like you were at a charity auction they just want somebody to stand\nUp and say Hi dollars I'm sure you you make twenty eight thousand dollars a year and they need to do something dramatic\nDo you ever know what you what you just one in the bed\nNo but I wanted to do something dramatic\nWell\nHow 'bout we'd be a bit more reason and you go to the silent auction and put it in a bed for a hundred dollars on something you can afford and I'm not be irrational because America's commercial interests should not be so easily compromised\nBecause a reporter wanted to make a story out of a question\nAmerica's interest commercial interests and national security interests\nShould not be so easily compromised by individuals who do not understand the totality a totality the comprehensive nature and the complicated nature of our international relations\n[noise] the same reporters demanding that Trump shutdown trade with Saudi Arabia that we not attend Saudi business summits\nThose same reporters had no problems with the Clinton family foundation\nReceiving loads of money\nFrom absolute desk butts from individuals who were torturing citizens in their own country who were suppressing any dissent who were accused of human rights violations broad human rights violations\nThe Clintons were giving speeches and receiving money bill Clinton was giving speeches and receiving money from countries\nThat secretary that ... that the department of state led by his wife did not even recognize that we're on watch lists that were on the list\nAnd it almost makes you wonder maybe those despot gave money to Hillary Clinton's husband so they could get off that list maybe they gave money to Hillary Clinton's husband so they could still do business in this country\nEven though our diplomatic approach was to put them in the corner in time out for now gosh where have we seen Democrat couples\nWhere money is given by an entity to one of the spouses and the Democrats couple to gain the influence or to gain influence\nWith the other spouse in the family to whom you could not legally give money directly oh that's right\nWe started our show talking about Bruce or was at the department of justice and Nellie or his wife who was brought into fusion GPS and given a lot of money to do who knows what\nFusion GPS gives Bruce or his wife a bunch of money which ends up in his bank account to fusion GPS give Bruce or his wife a bunch of money and then it has a meeting with Bruce or\nWere they given misinformation and say hey investigate Trump stop investigating Hillary and lo and behold he now says that meeting happened and the guy who wrote the check to his wife and ask for the meeting says it didn't and he won't come before Congress\nHe's taken the ...\nIt's almost as if there is a pattern\nIn these Democrat power couples were the man or the wife ends up in a position of of influence in authority and their spouse figures out a way to get paid by the people over whom they were exercising regulatory authority\nIt's quite the scheme if you think about it it'd\nBe like oh I don't know a criminal enterprise\nPaying the wife of a cop when lets the cops regular beat and somehow that cop never bothers that business as long as his wife is getting paid oh I don't know consulting contract and if she never find time to come and consult that's okay\nBecause we want to give to her and help the community\nWe see these cases time and time and time again Terry McAuliffe who was the Batman for the Clintons gave him the money to buy their house because they just spent their money settling the lawsuit with Paula Jones\nBecause he didn't back story goes have a ... on his John ... distinctive though it was that's an expensive ... all the costs you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to settle but then again when a woman can identify a frog loan your winter and you say you didn't\nPull it out on her oh yeah it looks like you got a practical or above ... that's going to cost ya 'cause that's not going to look good in court [noise] less you want to drop trial in front of everybody\nInterestingly he did drop trout he got to be president Kevin out didn't and was accused of [noise] all the irony interesting times we\nBut the other is called sprouted grain bread no it has gluten in it but it's it's a much better grain hasn't been process that has lived components to it and it's very very good for the justice system's got plenty of fiber in it\nAnd that's a good alternative sodas and other sweet drinks keep your blood sugar the normal range you want to avoid soda\nAnd of course the sugar the high fructose corn syrup they said that just to sugary drinks a day even use can raise the risk of diabetes about twenty six percent twenty six percent kind of a big deal if you cut out the the sodas and the juice and all that\nWill happen happen is you'll decreased and increase your chances of weight loss so that'll really come down quite a bit as well red meat is another one be cautious with you got to hold\nThe red meats especially the process needs now if you get a good organic for way not going to affect it that much but a lot of the processed meat\nLike once you may have the ... and they also have components in it and sugars in excess even some have high fructose corn syrup and it just added to make it taste better I guess\nSo we got to be cautious does but most fast food of course is probably not the best and again you see that the the breakdown like they'll let you see the labels and all that but you don't really know all the chemicals that are in these foods and that's what we have to be careful with but yeah\nOf the foods contain sugars in an excess corn syrup and what not to to beat them up and making taste better and the reality is only going to hurt you as far as you building\nYour right kind of a a blood sugar profound your body keeping a very very low impact and that's a big deal\nWith diabetes all the packaged foods so your your TV dinners and anything that's in a box for the most part I mean if we had to mess with a certain foods like potato chips and crackers and and all these different foods cereals that you take a potato and you turn it into potato chips if you have to modify foods\nThat modified food is probably not the best\nAnd we've learned that a lot of these foods of course raises blood sugar levels wants to process the changes what's called the glycemic load or the glycemic index of that food and it makes it a little bit higher\nShe'll be cautious of that and the last one\nIs a lot of the mill the sweetened the milk so you're everybody's on the big craze now ripe soy milk Allman no coconut milk no like all of them during this new Milken so great yet so great 'cause there's twenty grams of added sugar in it is what's so great because it tastes so good greeting ice cream or milk shake\nSo you want to go I mean you'll get ... go get 'em sweet and all and milk and they called me and told me how great that taste compared to the sweet and version let the ... on a milk you're drinking right now [laughter] it's not it's not even the same category and raise your blood sugar through the roof just not worth it so the better way to go is to get you an sweetened versions\nOr get raw cow's milk or raw goat milk from a local farmer now that from a health perspective and a lot of people say that I'm pasteurized no that's not healthy it is amazing\nMy opinion really really good but yet you're going to get the others like the common milk and all that go in Sweden and if you've got to ask them to do it because you don't like how it's just too bitter for you\nAn add a little bit of DVR monk fruit extract some of those can be really helpful as well

of food you have a long period of time and not getting the right kind of nutrition\nThat we need but the great news does that suit can change so much of everything that we do need and if we put the right kind of foods and guess what we're going to get high quality nutrition energy outputs cellular\nGrowth and the kind of body that we're looking for oh about health all that feeling good it's all about that ... that we're looking for so we're going to talk about one of my favorites which are great and grapes are fantastic\nIn the dark red ones were going to talk about the purple colored ones because the big key that we've seen over the years is a component called reserved patrol in the reserve patrol\nIs a strong antioxidant we're seeing it as the basis behind why doctors say hey a glass of wine a day is good for the heart well with the reserve it for all we know is amazing for the heart it he's got incredible components that support overall heart health\nAnd I mean the reality is the alcohol long term can be hard on the liver it's a depressant and it just got some negative effects that go along with it to do that every day probably this is my opinion probably not the best\nWould rather see someone in a handful of the dark grapes on a regular basis because there are loaded with reserved patrol and of course you get good carbohydrates you got fruit I mean you've got a fiber and you've got all kinds of nutrients that come out of that is much better to have\nHave some grapes as a snack with a handful of almonds in there you go\nMuch better now again [laughter] not that they're the same as wine and I realized that one I'm not anti wind either had to an end to alcohol is don't do it every day and he won't do it on the weekends or or that sort of thing that's fine but keep it in moderation that whole concept is really good but yeah\nGetting the right kind of nutrition and on a regular basis is going to matter and the grapes of do a lot of components don't want to talk about some of the details and the grades as well they're loaded with what's called ...\nActually can come in a really good for our health their gift for protecting the actual cell wall and the cells and then the carrots and was a really important to you guys do a routine the answer in which is great for the eyes I help is so critical and rates are actually a really good for that\nInformation to in the body and soul information what we're seeing now is one of the root causes for so much\nOf the disease were staying and it goes in and really just cut down\nOn the information and inflammatory process so\nA lot that can be done with that as well another key to where the information's relocate glued to sign on and and the antioxidants on the ... own they're finding out now is such an important measures probably the most important antioxidant and we have\nIn our system that reduced the oxidation\nAnd so awesome for the cardiovascular benefits it's pretty incredible so for heart health this is where the reserve a trial comes in\nAnd increases overall cardiac output you're relaxing blood vessels\nAnd it gives you blood better blood pressure regulation so it'll include helping to support lowering blood pressure potentially has a lot of cash 'em in it so that will help and then also it can it can reduce LDL cholesterol levels that's the bad cholesterol\nAnd in the reduction of LDL oxidation so the oxidation is not happening as much as the fat\nThat's just enough that sounded kind of technical that's that's a bad thing [laughter] and then watch clump together the platelets bills when ... when appropriate and then of course lower inflammatory regulation or better and play with her regulation\nAnd increases of the glue to sign on all that ski showing blood sugar benefits here's another one that I just think fascinating so the grapes actually have\nA moderately high\nGlycemic index I stayed around forty now watermelon gets up around Seventy five it's about a same as a piece of white bread\nOr white rice which can be relatively high and you got to be careful because that can throw when blood sugar levels get off like that it can cause a severe fluctuation and again you're dealing with insulin sensitivity and the way\nThe other is anti aging in longevity benefit to the the fight of nutrients that are inside of the grades are strongly beneficial the grape seeds and the great slash is great for just over all skin in the glow of their skin that go listen in the south lazy Bush than if you're in the south\nAnd the cognitive benefits are great too so\nEven now I'm not a big fan just that you know here I'm Talking about grapes right dark grapes I'm not a big fan of grape juice and the reason I'm not as good as it raised the blood sugar too much ... in the fiber out now do you want to blend it in a blender or like as a vitamin ... blender that's great knock it out\nBut really you don't want to get in and just do great just because it raises blood sugar way too much\nAnd the cognitive benefits they know that the the grapes themselves\nCan help to get Alzheimer's and dementia and they also cut down the beta amyloid protein which is in the hippocampus region in the brain and that cuts down on a lot of the information process he's\nAlso the anti microbial benefits a lot of those in anti cancer benefits so here we go to cancer right so
