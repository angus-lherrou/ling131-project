with downright danger it is today for young people between photos that are sent back and forth on line pose things people said share\nAnd all the way down to consensual sexual relations that then some a woman withdrawals two weeks later her consent after the fact\nAnd then whether that's a criminal act and we went through a case that reason magazine profiled at a university UC Davis where this happened\nAnd how do you know I've had people come up me and say Mike link that complicated I just told my son [noise]\nYou just don't have sex well if we were that easy\nBecause the sexual urge is

Democrats take control of out and\nVote will you support would you support an impeachment effort if your party controls\nThe house it is a good move for Democrats politically is basically ethically morally to pursue potentially an investigation that could lead to impeachment\nThere has been painting that the president but\nKavanaugh now that he has Supreme Court justice\nRiding on this idea that Democrats are are if that Democrats intend to unpaid sets Kavanaugh as a way to keep the enthusiasm about the nomination and play is it realistic to expect and investigation that could potentially and

alternative again [laughter]\n[noise] well here's the thing what'd you fire would\nBe you have to look at one of the things you've got to look at his iodine and having someone check you getting some testing done for I'd on levels is very very important the reason being is I don't as the number one trace mineral used by the thyroid gland itself is extremely\nDependent on it so we don't get much in our diet in the eighties they took it out and replace it with ...\nSo your doctors can run a simple little testing your analysis test and they can see what your eyes on levels are finding out\nWhat the iodine levels are\nWill make a big big difference hey that's first and foremost then on the medication side you have to take meds ask your doctor about armor or nature thyroid both of those are really good they they\nThey support the sovereign glimpse he also pushed the thyroid to continue to make some of its own and that's what I like about it plus it from a natural source and the derivative is is natural so is your body can handle that and you're and you do well with that it's a it's definitely a great way to go and look into that first and foremost\nTo get a good game plan together and then at that point\nWhat you can do is of course if it's medically necessary to get to do that great not and you can support it naturally but don't forget about foods okay food support the thyroid gland really and every other system in the body but your\nYour basic foods at your broccoli cauliflower and all the different ... vegetables if you have a slow thyroid hypo okay Hi Beau means low if you have a slow thyroid at that point\nThen you have to be a little bit careful\nOn that because one thing you want to do and make sure is that you're eating the kinds of foods that will support healthy sorry functions and that's what I Do encourage you to do\nIs to look at that and then of course things like coconut oil which you cook with and you can put in your smoothies are getting a couple tablespoons of that day has been known in shown in studies to be supportive to this hour glands all this great information\nIs amazing right gluten free diets that's another thing by the way we drink when does the thyroid typically can be very helpful the gluten is a protein that's found in most grains and we hear a lot about it now gluten free this gluten free that what is that even main\nGluten free don't take away my bread [laughter] that's that's what I get a hit with all the time is don't take my breath away don't take the pasta away\nFor a period of time it's good to cut those out you have to cut it out completely\nGoing gluten free does help and a lot of ways\nBut encouraging piece of that that I think is really important is getting to see if you're gluten sensitive or not and um if you're ... disease then gluten can be a strong challenge to the body as a whole\nAnd you really have to look at that but again it's a ... if you're if you're just gluten sensitive and cutting out gluten altogether can help a host of issues I mean\nFrom fatigue to brain fog all these kinds of issues can be quite challenging so looking at gluten in removing it can be helpful but they're saying now that the long term damage in the intestines\nCould raise the risk of hip fractures and people will steal a disease a new study says so the journal of clinical ... and the chronology of metabolism they were talking about ... new people ate it\nAnd how when they avoided it it allowed the digestive tract to begin to heal and they're saying now that the research confirmed that patients that have higher rate of hip fractures when tissue damage persisted over time\nBecame quite the challenge and sticking to a gluten free diet is crucial bishop or minimizing tissue damage in reducing the risk of serious fractures that can cause other complications ... disease\nIs an auto immune disorder that affects about one percent of people in the United states and it's known that people ... disease or the heightened risk for broken bones but it wasn't clear up there ...\nThe rest remained high long after they began a gluten free diet so in this study though the physician's office of the debate whether people see the disease actually benefit from follow up in in these sorts of things but they are now finding that removing gluten as a whole for people that deal with any of these issues especially ... disease\nIs a great benefit so again good information\nWhen you're dealing with something like this because the challenges Lucille the disease so many times that people struggle I mean it's if you ever see someone that each wheat or some kind of grain than as steely act the cramping bloating and just the the digestive related challenges that\nGo
