Vegas police and then the video coming out showing it's not the case the column Capra nicks who taking me during the national anthem or Eric read those are not great representatives of the NFL\nBut Drew Brees with his nuclear families children there\nAnd then talking about\nHis life experiences his inspiration his mother grandmother and grandfather\nLife so that people most of\nI don't\nAnd it's true you know the little league baseball the a\nLittle league football pee wee football professional sports seems so far from that baseball seems more connected to it slowly groups but you see professional football and it doesn't feel like\nThe into journey of what started at the local high school or middle school or elementary school\nWhere kids we started playing tackle football we were wearing pads in second grade they don't do that any more my oldest started playing tackle football this year in seventh grade and my youngest is in fifth grade\nBut for him to give credit to the people when he was a little bitty kid toting him to practice because guess what those parents out there who are at the game and at home watching that's what they do with their kids that's\nWhere the professional football league community went wrong is the kind of people that are being talked to after the game or not living the kind of lives of the people buying the tickets now\nGot the sweets that are being purchased by corporations but there are a lot of families that work hard maybe pick up some overtime shifts can't afford season tickets but dad takes son or daughter\nMaybe one of their friends to a football game that's an expensive undertaking that league seems so distant so disconnected from that fan and\nTo me that's a metaphor for what's happened to music it's a metaphor for what's happened to film the movies it's a metaphor for what's happened to the university\nJust a university looked like a place that middle America wants to go to anymore do these professors looked like the kinds of people you'd want to send your your child to be educated by\nJordan Peterson posted today that forty percent of top tier liberal arts colleges have zero Republicans\nAs faculty members\nIs that's what's happened\nHave the universities that are funded by taxpayer dollars become so disconnected\n\nIs there a university faculty member that has a family member who's a cop when you trash\nCops I have a brother that's a cop\nMost Americans personally know a cop do you think university professors do how far removed or ... or most professional football players from the lives of the fans\nThe farmers that drive from two hours out to come to a game\nHow far removed as a George Clooney from the people who buy tickets to go see him in the movies are Harvey Weinstein how far removed was Matt Lauer with his button under his desk\nI'm not mad at him for making twenty million dollars a year and having a states all over New York a mad at him for lecturing middle America and referring to white males as rapists\nWhen in fact what he was doing was treacherous\nAnd I would argue that that continues through to the Democrat Party the party of white liberal elites is disconnected from the very people\nThat they claim to speak for men and women\nHugo has cruise up by six Emerson College has cruise up by five public policy polling has him up by three reform Austin has him up by four ... up by nine Mitt\nRomney won Texas by sixteen percentage points Trump won it by nine and cruises up by in Quinnipiac poll by nine\nIt turns out that Hollywood in New York can't tell the state of Texas who are senator is going to be Heidi Heitkamp is struggling in North Dakota where she said\nThat she was going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but then when he got mad over them calling him a serial rapist and having run a rape bringing gang banks and all that she decided she didn't like that shit like that at all\nDo oh okay well how would how would you are the men in your life respond to being called all these nasty names was he supposed to sit there and smile\nHe didn't take his beating like he was supposed to\nWin you and your ill were on civil to him how was he supposed to respond\nTo not be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for which\nWe will have a civil outlet for our side of protest\nIn just a few weeks and I think you're going to be shocked\nGoing to say stop [noise] enough [noise]\n\nHey Dan can you believe it that ten year anniversary of getting a great\nNight sleep I Know Trina for ten years he quiet has been helping couples like us kicked snoring out of bed think of the millions of lives we've changed and that all happened ... years before other ... companies shut up on the scene the quiet really started a revolution\nHigh were Dan and Trina as the founders of CSI quiet people often ask what sets us apart from the competition it's easy with our problem\nAnd we know what ...\nAccusations underway I leave sound like Sarah Fox news hurricane Michael now a category three star with ... wins you one hundred twenty miles per hour forecasters warned it could strength into category for when it makes landfall Florida governor Rick Scott warning residents of the panhandle to be preparing me\nReally when it comes to her on the farm to consumer legal Defense Fund\nOn behalf of vinegar family farm in Wisconsin in several other farms filed a lawsuit against the Wisconsin department of agriculture trading consumer protection\nBack in February asking it to clarify its interpretation of the law in regards to raw milk mean check this out on line was confidence among the most restrictive us states as far as raw milk is concerned\nRaw milk sales to consumers are prohibited the private cashier agreements which the individuals purchase shares of their own cows\nAre exempted however due to the onslaught of raids in recent years against Raul dairies private raw milk buying clubs and even raw milk cows share programs the plaintiffs simply wanted to clarify Wisconsin stance concerning these alternative forms are alternate forms of accessing raw milk so you can't do that just say you know if you weren't raw milk\nIt is you know technically against the law just sell it in the states but you can go in and a lot of farms you can go in and you know kinda buy into a cow and you can get your gallon or so a week of raw milk from the cow that you've partially owned\nAnd so it's just amazing the life that they had and to watch that type of living on a farm and just having the good produce and the fruits and vegetables and just the the grass fed beef I grew up like that\nAnd just the health that you get from from that versus what we have today and the regular population is just unbelievable so I Hope more people look into the raw milk and you know really support the people locally around you the farmers no matter where you live you live in the city of maybe a little bit more difficult but even in the suburbs\nIf you drive a little bit farther out just look because the farmers are around\nMore than you would think and you know supporting them there's always a great way to go but with all due for your family health benefits are amazing triple eight to eight three Seventy two Seventy two ... two eight three Seventy two Seventy to call me right now the part of the show

wheat products and Graham's for a period of about a month or so that's bread pasta cereal crackers all the flowers stuff\nThat many of us eat that can play a big big role in skin conditions whether
