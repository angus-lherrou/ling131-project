people going about their business mostly trucks\nBut many vans and the passenger cars as well but to watch people pull off to the side of the road\nAnd take their head off some of them looking down to show respect for somebody that they didn't even know to the family members who were passing by to take I don't know how long the procession was had to be at least five minutes\nMost people have so convinced themselves that they're running late to life that everything has to be driving up on somebody's asked\nTrying to drive over I'm trying to whip through traffic an endangered children in the process as if that makes it tough I've heard that one is called ... mind you know it'll kill some kids\nGreat that's well that's that's fantastic but anyway everybody's in a rush and to see people stop like that for a moment and just pull off the side of the road as a show of respect\nIt is it is such a simple gesture but such a powerful gesture\nThere were people who as we passed in front of their houses\nVery modest houses in the cove for those of you know orange ... these are small little ship lap eight hundred square foot house there's no garage not fancy not was simple ... put it that way\nAnd just see them come out on their their front door steps and it was it for us in particular I think they do this as as a matter of practice\nAnd when I think back to things that I appreciate about a small town it is that things like marking the passing of a human beings life has value now there might not be as much to do\nThat might not be as many forms of diversion professional sports teams in every field movie theater on every corner coffee shop to on every corner\nNo that's true there's not as much to do there's not as many ways to entertain yourself or distract yourself or make money\nBut to be at a point where things that should matter do matter is to me pretty strong marker especially when you're a member of a family that has on your way to a burial things like that matter and it just made me stop and think\nThat kind of person who values pulling over to pay respect to a family member\nOf a family you likely don't know I don't recognize taking time out of your life\nThat is a simple but profound gesture that people in rural communities make it is a simple but profound gesture that people in big cities don't make which tells you there is a different set of values\nAnd a different expression of those values\nSo should we be surprised\nThat those two different people who react very differently to something as important\nOr unimportant as the passing of a family in a funeral procession should we be surprised that two people who view something like that as so dramatically different as to how I should respond\nThat those two groups of people would respond differently to a professional football player taking a knee during the national anthem\nThe kind of person who has an internal barometer that says whatever we're doing right now is not important the most important thing I can do with my life is the sacrifice of ten minutes to pull over to the side of the road take off my cap\nAvert their gaze look down and wait until the procession is gone a sacrifice not saying they emptied their bank account gave up their home but it's a pretty profound statement it's giving everything you have at that moment\nYou're coming the opposite direction on a road the only thing you have to offer the oncoming traffic you're nothing to offer them except your willingness to pull off to the side of the road\nTake off your cab avert their gaze look down and wait until they passed\nIs giving everything that you possibly can at that moment the kind of person who values such a thing\nHas another set of values consistent with that has values that apply across the board the kind of person for whom that would never happen would never even crossed their mind does not see gestures as important\n[noise] does not seem rituals as important the kind of person that blows passed a professional in a big city which is ...\nBig or just kind of small like a little like a baby so I kind of it's kind of small yeah and then when we asked about I mean\nIf it gets read and it really starts hurting alive probably want to go see your doctor for sure and just let them take a look at it that the big thing you have to worry about what those is if it gets infected that's the big challenge and you know for the most part\nAnd just look those tend to resolve on their own but if it sticks around longer than\nYou know they always say just just say no rules um a lotta docks will save it sticks around longer than two weeks then you need to get it checked out to get something done you know so just keep in mind okay thanks for the call AAA to eight three Seventy two Seventy two lines are open questions about your health let's go to Jake Jake\nThank you so\n[noise] with a\nLot about it as well for for for a medication or its ups and downs but a new doctor gave me I'm twenty six year next to this day and age of\n... kind of well first and foremost we are dealing with diabetes you're dealing with you know a de her right down to function a couple of things to think about that are really really important okay now first\nYou've got to get your died under control that's that has to be a key so you start eating the right kind of foods\nProteins fats carbohydrates in balance especially the proteins in the fat because when you're dealing with a blood sugar conditions like diabetes you want to keep everything balanced so your weight stays under control your fitness levels\nWill stay high if you start exercising so at least four to five days a week is usually a recommended just for good lifestyle plan\nYou know that's that's critical now on the flip side if you're talking about ...\n[noise]\nYou know it depends ... they really did go hand in hand and if you got any type of blood sugar related issues sometimes it can affect a\nKind of your performance\nFor sure helpful things you think about no while you're while you're going through this is as your fitness level improves okay so you dropped for dropping belly fat\nYou get in shape cardiovascular shape increases bend the blood flow is going to increase as well now from a chemical perspective you can get some blood work done with your primary care doctor\nAnd they can take a look at things and many times can look and find certain reasons why maybe some of the performances lacking okay\nSo there's some some tests and things that they can do also from the nutritional perspective you can look at things like nitric oxide which combined together\nOkay so you got ill are Janine el ... both of those together form the NO two they've done and they've done numerous studies on that and have seen some just amazing results with guys they deal with that and I'll tell you kind of an old school treatment\nOr that the doctors have used for years is coffee believe it or not and caffeine and high amounts of of caffeine from like green tea and that sort of thing it's the caffeine is in the same category drug class category as a fossil die of strays inhibitor\nAnd so you're ... those ... those sorts of things so it's in the same category\nAnd\nBelieve it or not guys that drink and and this is not a free ticket to start bringing pots of coffee so you have [laughter]\nSo you have better performance but it does do a similar mechanism I mean obviously it's in the same class\nSo it can't help but anyway how long he's thinking about it it's it's about getting a good foundation now I don't think it's just one thing or taking a supplement like tribute lesser mockery route and that's going to just kind of correct everything is really not it's it's a combination\nIn your mind plays a big role too with a D huge issue and your mind\nSo as you get your mind relaxing you and you remove stressors from your life\nThen that can make a huge
