{"year": "2018", "station": "WLAC", "show_name": "Dr. Asa On Call", "month": "10", "state": "TN", "day": "09", "content": "Along so back story\nAbout how most of which is source to the Daily Caller but Sandy Peterson put this together [noise]\nJones the former Senate a staffer also sent Waldman a link\nTo an article at McClatchy that appeared three days later on march twenty two thousand Seventeen which\nReported that federal investigators were looking into whether right wing news sites like Breitbart and infowars played a part in Russia's election oriented cyber operations\nFor his part the slate reporter for his his name appears to have received the alpha bank information from a lawyer from the from that hired fusion GPS on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC\nAccording to the report released by the house intelligence committee in April of this year Michael Saltsman a partner at the firm Perkins coy\nTold then FBI general counsel James Baker about the alpha bank server activities before the two thousand six the intellectual and\nHe apparently shared the information with the slate journalist who wrote the story about the supposed it's secret server\nAnd guess what\nJames Baker the former FBI general counsel testified behind closed doors closed doors last week so we don't know what other GM's\nHe has released [noise] but rest assured as long as congressional Republicans retained the house so that they can keep dragging these FBI officials before them\nThere are so many sordid details that still need to be unpacked\nAnd for those of you are frustrated and rightfully so recognized this\nWe're dealing with the FBI we're dealing with the highest levels including the director of the FBI\nAnd his top tier of officials unpacking what they've done is not an easy thing\nIt's not an easy thing at all it's a dangerous thing it's a frightening thing but that process is underway\nAnd I think some of them if they haven't already been done to correct I think if congressional Republicans will keep the heat on them\nI think that you will see some of them beginning to crack especially if it looks like the pressure is on them [noise] my fear is we're twenty nine days from election day if Republicans don't hold the house and I think they will\n[noise] if Republicans don't hold the house\nThen Nancy Pelosi becomes the speaker and any investigation into\nThe FBI and the Democrat Party and Hillary's campaign the DNC and the media any and all investigations into that as driven by Congress will evaporate\nAnd the sad sad reality is that we may never know exactly what happened we might still never know\nBut it gives me great joy to know that those FBI officials at the top ranks who were part of this or squirming Peter ... with his little whimpering ways and Coby\nCoby has to have at his core a fear that the things he was up to will be disclosed he has\nTo be down worry because Donald Trump is not a shrinking violet and if he gets the goods on call me he's going to pursue it\nIs personal\nAnd we're at the point now where Trump is shown he does not fair to these people these into deep\nHe he is not walking away from the Bruce or isn't the Peter straws extend the Rod Rosenstein means\nAnd Bob Mueller by the way where's that Russian collusion here we are closing in on two years where's that Russian collusion\n[noise] I don't care about how much money they spent because it's a drop in the bucket for the federal government and I actually think that you do investigations when they're warranted this one wasn't\nTo arrive at the truth and the cost to society is far greater than the cost of an investigation if you've got corruption run 'em up\nBut I don't think this investigation into trouble is being done in good faith I think it was based on planted in a plant that information\nI think they knew that there was nothing there I think this was intended to be able to harass him which it has done\nTo his credit he he's managed to accomplish as as Mary Madeleine said nothing short of a miracle what he has accomplished\nBut I Will leave you with a bit of uncertainty and that is what will Mueller do in the next twenty nine days\nBecause I think I truly believe Mueller and call me and that entire route Neal McCabe astronaut ... Andrew McCabe I think that they all fear\nA Trump presidency if he has a majority in the Senate majority in the house I think they fear\nHim finding out the various things they've done and I still think there's plenty of it out there and I think they fear what he might do in terms of unleashing pounds to prosecute them for crimes committed if in fact they did\nSo I worry what Mueller will try to pull because they've shown a willingness to plant stories that aren't true call me went to the New York times gay went to his buddy at Columbia to hand off to the New York times information that they thought it would be damning against Trump\nAnd yet despite all of that despite all the rape allegations Kavanaugh is confirmed\nIt's going to be a very very interesting very interesting next twenty nine days [noise]\n\nI'm hoping I'm\nWell\nLet me not ... but ah it let me just say it's going to be a very very very interesting twenty nine days I'll look forward to are spending more time than usual with those of you who are casual listeners\nNow's the time to lock in\nNow's the time we get focused now's the time that we talk about the issues that are going to drive voters cast their ballots in the upcoming elections I'm going to be encouraging folks to vote early new poll and Texas has a Ted Cruz up over ... by six percentage points\nWe like that [noise]\n\n\nHey dad can you believe it's at your anniversary of getting a great night sleep I Know Trina for ten years the quiet has been helping couples like us kicked snoring\nRight now what's interesting though is that stem cell therapies themselves can give you life back to a joint that's been torn down because it actually uses your own cells your own stem cells\nTo go back in and ... re injected so the stem cells were taken out of the body usually in the bone marrow or the fat tissue in the body the added post issues would call it it's them processed and then we'll call spun down and and there's a process to it and then this re injected into the troubled area\nThemselves go in and help to repair and regenerate cartilage that can help rebuild ... muscle repairs muscle tissue and can give life so there was a sixty five seven year old man and one of our lifestyle provider locations that then had ... it was pretty much bone on bone and within a four to six month period\nAlmost had a quarter inch re grows in the joint space\nAnd went back to not just normal activity but superseded his activity\nInto ... levels that when he was in his thirties and forties is that real it's real\nAnd is it happening yes and they've been doing it in Europe for a long time it's not like it's a brand new discovery it's just been the United states and and doing what they call FDA cleared\nOver say the last five years or so so you're starting to see a lot of these pop up in in a lot of people do really well with them so stem cell therapy as it's something that you I I think is a real viable option for people\nDo your research and find places that you can go to and get good information about it and talk to doctors that are trained in it that understand it and and use it and had been using a clinical practice but it's amazing it really is and it's something that that you should look at\nFor a variety of reasons because it just brings health I mean is is a future called regenerative medicine it's a field but I really believe it's a huge future medicine that gives people back quality of life and that's really what we're about on this show\nAnd really in the style of\nOf what I like to teach is what type of healthcare can give people higher quality of life because of the day that's what we all need right we want to thrive and want to live well when they have good energy you want to have good relationships and we want to have every one of bill a squeeze everything we can out of every day\nAnd if you have low energy feel terrible ache and you're hurt in life is just not that much fun\nSo we want to figure out ways to give you a higher quality of life that's what we did hear on the show and that's what matters stem cell therapy is pretty amazing triple eight to eight three seven to seven

other than the replacement of wondering why would be appropriate solution for it which\nI think the ethical exactly what I'm Talking about stem cell therapy\nI think it's a perfect option and and again if you need help with that just let us know get use somebody that can give you a consultation and just help you there's a lot of great clinics around the country right now that are doing it\nBut stem cell therapies fantastic because you can you can do things like how again okay there's holler on a gas can injected it's been approved by Medicare and all that for a long time but how ironic acid is a natural substance I like it okay I really do um I'm a fan of it I think it works great\nBut it's temporary it will go in and create cushioning inside of a joint like in the\nBut it ... it wears off in six months you know it's not something that goes in and repairs the tissue the thing about stem cells is that when you use stem cells it goes in and what actually repairing regenerate and rebuild the tissue\nAnd when you do something like that it just it's a game changer when you go into repaired or generate the tissue is an absolute game changer\nFor what we're talking about and so what would you having when you say you know college days on that you've got a little bit of cartilage on both sides right and so all of the body needs to stem cell was is to be able to go in and lock in into those areas and it can really repair and rebuild\nAnd that's the ultimate ... you get in and get the body to do that\n... that's your ear off and running and and literally it may take now here's the thing Ninety\nDays to six months before you starting to see anything so that's the one thing was stem cells like if you get a treatment done it's not like tomorrow you're going to feel amazing ... it's going to take some time however those effects are lasting and the worst case scenario about stem cells this people say well is it going to hurt me\nWell that's a great thing about it because of bad surgery can make things worse right\nSo if he had a surgery this botched up then that can really create a lot of challenges for you and your health but the great thing about stem cell is that if you're either going to get better for nothing's gonna happen\nSo low either work for they won't [noise] is that you just have to kind of understand that\nBut the good news is that what I

[noise] they ... it was\nLike you more as a kid I\nWhere they may\nThat stuff needs to be working and we need to get that is as high as we can because the healthy testosterone levels actually and there's disagreements in this okay and healthcare\nBut there's there's different schools of thought and some schools of thought said that you need to lower testosterone to avoid profit issues other schools about say if you get to loan that testosterone it can affect and cause trusted issues\nI Love the example I heard a a urologist talked about at a conference and he said when you think about prostate health\nYou think about a young person when like a guy mail in his twenties where his just offshore numbers so just you know it goes from zero to let's just say twelve hundred on the scale when\nYou're in your teenage years Eighteen to twenty five you're probably running about nine hundred on the testosterone scale when you get in your thirties and forties you're probably getting about seven fifty\nAnd then when you get into your say fifties or sixties you're probably getting down around four to five hundred so slowly declines\nBut a lot of people try to keep a guy that had prostate cancer around one fifty I mean just bottom of the barrel but if you realize that ... the guy urologist said he goes how many how many kids how many young guys that were in Eighteen to twenty five had prostate cancer\nWhen their testosterone was running nine hundred none so we don't get into trouble until the testosterone levels really start to drop\nAnd so there's a lot of debate on that my point is is that ... can drop it green tea is great it can actually support healthy testosterone levels but it's actually really good for a lot of different things green tea has got like a sixty five percent ... percent reduction\nAcross the board of all cancers so it's just got tremendous benefits overall health I'm big green tea guy I'm a huge fan of it promoted I'm using a big fan we use it in
