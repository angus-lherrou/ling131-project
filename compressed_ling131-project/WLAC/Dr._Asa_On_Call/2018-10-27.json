said you're not taking medicine so I'm assuming that\nYou know that that's that's why I talk to your cardiologist about them knowing the regimen is just good they put it in a chart they know where you what you've been doing they may not agree with it but that's okay you know if it's your body your decision\nAnd it's okay for you to tell them how you want to do things\nBased on your own choices it's okay but they need to know so they can file it you know at least they know what you've been doing so when you come in two years from now a year from now for a checkup at least they they're up to up to

everything you can to get the nutrients that you need out of your food\nThat is a big big deal for me\nKnowing that that you want to get it out of your food I mean that's that's the case you have to plan very well and I sounds like you're already in that phase where you're planning very well eating very well so that's a good thing\nBut to make sure that you're getting that every single day and

fade into us a blue Jay was\nLike you more as a kid I\nWe moved\n\nBecause although it's nice to take a break for a little while if you've been busting your can\n... at the end of the day a man wants to feel like he has purpose especially if he's a hard worker he's got good work ethic and there's some guys are just lazy and they don't want to do anything I don't know what to do and all that I don't even understand that mindset I just have\nThat but then there's guys that get up and they just they just run hard all day and they just got an intense drive to make a difference and to have an\nIn life regardless of what that is for them whatever the gift and talents and abilities are they want to do their best and they want to serve and they want to leave a legacy of something of themselves here on this earth when they leave to their kids and their grandkids and I think that when a man retires\nSomething happens it's kind of like you work hard and you know then all of a sudden you retire and you're like is this all there is I'm just kind of like fade out\nAnd the stress that could be causing some of these issues and they can be subconscious he probably tell you I'm fine I don't know what's going on he's probably you know if he's got that kind of mentality but the reality is\nYou know ... it's a lot of men go through this and that could be his body's way of adapting or you know trying to cope with distress I'm not working and not being at the pace that he used to be at\n[noise] so it's something to consider for sure and I mean I wouldn't even ... I wouldn't even asking those questions you know without getting ... getting defensive and actually see if you can dig in there a little bit if you can figure out exactly what's going on and kind of you know find I find that place where he's at\nAnd again adrenal fatigue if it is in that category and it could be a junior ...\nDriven by the emotions and if it is there's a lot of things supplemental you can do from\nYou know eating better you avoid red meat red wine processed foods that can increase and strengthen the adrenal glands salt intake provide he doesn't have high blood pressure can actually really help rebuild the adrenal people that craves salt or in a drain also take for the most part\nYou know there's there's several supplements hospital staring green tea there there's a lot of great healthy foods that can rebuild the adrenal vitamin D five vitamin C there's a lot of great things you can look into [noise]\nBut at the end of the day I think you have to get to the root of\nWhat's going on see what all the medical tests say negative\nThat's one of the common sense meter needs to kick in\nAnd need to start looking at some of the mental\nTypes of issues tackle those and watch what happens with this house [noise]\n[noise] our health is determined by the choices that we make every single day health is not the absence of disease mindful about our daily lifestyle that's where my nobody comes in one of the easy to use mind helping out\nAnd designed improve wellness and bill straight between your lifestyle choices and your progress with the mind help he asked you could easily track your health goals increase awareness connect with community reduce stress and improved physical wellness visit mine healthy dot com as mine\nExpand your brand was PG media PG media or the digital business and branding expert with innovative and affordable website design fast turn around and amazing customer service called my good friends that PG media today at AAA for one for seven four or five four that's AAA for one for seven four or five for a visit\nP.

you want to empower their health you want to figure out a way to be able to take them from where they are to where they need to be sent me an email you want me to make it part of the show we'll human answering private\nWe will whenever we need to do to help you be a better you so you can be better for others to help them that's what this is all about it's about people helping others and you don't have to be a doctor\nTo help others you just need the information in the care and concern to be able to provide that information and empower them that's what it's about mammograms big topic in so many people they they wonder well they cause more harm than\nThe benefit for the screenings and doctors as they overdo them\nWell there's a study out and again it's one of the longest running breast cancer screening studies in breast cancer obviously is one of the top leading health challenges that we have among women\nAnd they do a breast cancer screening study is the largest whenever conducted regular mammograms prevent deaths from breast cancer and the number of lives saved increased over time in International Research team set on Tuesday\nThe study of a hundred and thirty thousand women into communities in Sweden showed a thirty percent fewer women in the screening\nOf breast cancer and this effect persisted year after year so now twenty nine years after study began to research has found that the number of women saved from breast cancer goes up with each year of screening and we found that the longer we look\nThe more lives are said professor Steven Duffy the queen Mary University of London whose study was published in the journal radiology send this statement he said that he said that\nElizabeth breast care center Rochester New York there was a doctor deterrent is and he's he was not involved in the study but the radiologist were and they can Kurd with the sweetest study saying that it's even more benefit than we understood in the beginning\nSo what do you need to do well here's the deal was mammograms\nObviously you need to have um I I think so and and there's a lot of natural guys out there and gals that will they're probably just saying you've got to be crazy but I'm\nI've seen too much I've worked with physicians that do this for a living I've seen the results dressings are over done at times yes does think breast demography can be beneficial there's some controversy on that\nThere's [noise]\nI'll tell you there's some challenging research on it can they be good yes can they be invalid and have you looking at things that aren't even cancer yes\nBut so can mammograms so the mammogram as a standard right now and that's what you know obviously the gold standard for screening purposes\nAnd some ... if you're wanting more of a natural alternative approach you can go that route no doubt about it but at the end of the day I mean breast cancer is nothing to play around with an early detection just like anything else is the key and they are catching an early it is amazing I have worked with some of the breast centers\nIn the country and seen how their team works in the team a fresh from the radiologist to the oncologist to the breast surgeons and it is phenomenal\nHow it works and saving lives and so on that's why you know I'm a I'm a fan and screenings and I don't think it's waste and I'm a fan of testing\nAnd people said well what about the radiation and what about you know causing cancer and what about the biopsies and that's that's a whole different animal is there's different ways the biopsy and there's different ways of doing that and you know and again that comes down to personal decision and personal choice\nSo one oncologist well say cancer cells don't spread another one says we don't really know so it just depends on who you're talking with an adamant they are but studies that they've read and the studies that have been a part of so again it is personal decision personal choice but just know that they've done\nPretty big study in Sweden in it it definitely brought larger percentages I Know that there are some dogs don't agree with that I'm kind\nThe middle on that because I've seen research for both men and this one so strong percentages toward was leading to catching an early which is a big big key AAA to eight three Seventy two Seventy two let's go to ... ...\nIt's how you doing live well what's up\nI'm I have a question about X amount of K okay um\nI didn't it didn't come on later on in life you know after I turned thirty five and I just spent a choice in Iraq\nCame back when I was over there and everything was fine you know but I came back they send a\nMan of Georgia and things like my cat is driving humid atmosphere uh but\nI'm trying to find out if there are some even take entirely to reduce the inflammation\nOr the dryness because after you take a shower so maybe about three minutes later they get really dry ... more years on and you know it's like absorbs it like
