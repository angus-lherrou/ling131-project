D.\nC. so the mother who loses her child to a drug overdose wants an outlet for that which is perfectly understandable so the outlet if she goes to the politicians are politicians say\nI'm going to do something about that I'm going to be tough on drugs oh great we're going to be tough on drugs part of being tough on drugs is it we're going to arrest kids teenagers high school students\nCollege students people who are using very few drugs people who are using drugs because they're in a very bad state\nSo you made a bad choice to use drugs and therefore we're now going to ruin your life we're going to put a criminal ah record on you were going to ... to you with that and you'll never be able to work again and that's how we're going to show you that were out to help you because those drugs are bad for you\nWell it's hard to get people to buy into that so instead what we've decided as well we're not actually trying to help you were just trying to punish you because if you're using a drug you're breaking into people's homes or raping women you're stealing cars and you're killing people\nWill most recreational drug users aren't doing any of those things well that's okay never mind who's going to stand up for the drug user because the only people standing up for drug users are drug users and nobody wants to be a drug user is why you can put penalties on going to a strip club you can put penalties on porn use you can make any law you want going into someone's\nBedroom because no one wants to stand up and go that's a violation of our civil liberties well you must be a bad person that's the old Salem witch trials which test and it's wrong\nSo what Kanye was saying was actually a head of the ... the media just needed a trash him when they used to love him because he was saying that President Trump's doing a good job and guess what he is\nYou can say Conyers crazy all you want Donald Trump for the Republicans are doing a great job that's why we're going to show vote in a couple of days [noise]\nTo give all the more you're [noise]\nSouth American ...

don't so\nI don't know about you but I had great parents that that was very blessed and\nMy mother did a great job of balancing out the home as far as eating goes I mean I I got into healthy eating
