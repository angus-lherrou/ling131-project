show\n[noise]\n[noise] yeah it's a big question I I'll tell you this isn't it cholesterol is not that big of a deal every week we get so nervous about it because we think about heart attacks and we've been scared so much about cholesterol\nBut cholesterol actually you can have too low of a cholesterol if you believe that it's our hormones systems are really really based around cholesterol they're made to testosterone estrogen the different hormones that are made from cholesterol so cholesterol gets too low when a lot of times to somebody goes through a heart episode of some kind\nThey will you get on a stat and drug in and get their cholesterol numbers really really low like the whole total number under one thirty\nAnd it makes a cardiologist happy because the ... the chances of an episode happening are pretty low with that but then there's also some new studies that can show the possibility of a stroke\nCan happen as a possibility for having to lower cholesterol so I mean there's a there's a catch twenty two there so to keep the cholesterol up and and keep it healthy cholesterol number a couple of things I like eggs\nI think eggs every single day or a good regulator for cholesterol exercise is really good we know there's two types of cholesterol this HBO cholesterol that's a good one and then there's the LDL that's the bad cholesterol so they keep HBO cholesterol up you want to focus more on the healthy foods\nNow to healthy fats rather like omega three fats almonds wellness caches avocados and make a sixes in science and then high omega threes what you're going to get in flaxseed oil but more importantly fish oil and I like eating having fish on a regular basis I I think it's much better option\nFor getting your mega three sources ... are fantastic as well\nBut keeping that in a normal routine can make a big difference and can help you really keep those numbers now I Do think and this is my opinion of course their guidelines you want to stand by keeping the cholesterol under under two hundred is pretty much the standard the big one is the LDL not letting it climb up too much\nAnd different cardiologist have varying opinions but usually want to keep it under a hundred they say if you had any kind of cardiac episode of any kind or even if you have high blood pressure they would want to keep that number to LDL number under about eighty\nAnd that keeps everybody happy but again I Would say that would keep it run around that number you wouldn't want it to drop in the lower than that because you need it and what's interesting is as we've lowered cholesterol levels\nThroughout time over the last I Would say five to ten years we see I've seen a dramatic increase in ... the need for hormones so I mean it really birth to an entire industry in the medical profession of hormone replacement therapy\nAnd we're seeing a ton of people that have low cholesterol and need to replace all their hormones and so they you know taken stat and drugs and they're and they're taking hormones I'm not saying that that's bad I'm just saying\nIt is what it is and so there there's a great example of one lifestyle choice offsetting another and having these medications to balance out the two so there's a lot we can do with diet and there's a lot we can do a lifestyle that can make a huge impact triple eight to eight three Seventy seven to

overweight and I just can't get my health back I Can't get my life back\nThe reality is you can one thing I don't understand is that your excuses have kept you where you are so telling yourself that you can't telling yourself that it's not possible telling yourself that you're not able to make it telling yourself that it's just that you that things aren't possible that's what kept is kept you where you are\nSo just encourage you that forget about the past it's gone you got to focus on today make new choices and that's what's going to give you the health that we're looking for ... to eight three Seventy seven to now when it comes out of brain health and cognition the way we think\nIs powerful okay it really really as powerful\nAnd one of the keys that you have to look at and there's there's a ... as we age if we don't keep our mind active whether it's reading or staying really engaged in keeping her mind extremely active working memory cognition then it it can begin to fade it's just like it's just like our bodies you know you don't ... your body activity you\nYou use it or you don't use it you lose that that kind of thing\nSo whether it's running jogging weightlifting whatever it is\nWe really want to get our bodies to a place where we don't lose mobility and function I'm real big on that so as we age we want to make sure we maintain flexibility want to maintain\nA good cardiovascular conditioning joined a health be able to to run and and and thrive and function and not lose that\nIt's so important to be able to have that in our lives\nSo one of the keys that that I'm real big fan of is when it comes to keep your body strong it had to keep your mind strong to mind is drawing the body will follow\nAnd ... there's a there's a lot of different products that they are I use one called alpha brain if you haven't checked it out go to alpha brain and and check it because it is amazing alpha brain\nForward slash in shape so if you get out from reinforced sauce and safe I think that they give you discounts and all that based on her show but it is they use ingredients that are organic\nAnd I've never seen such a change in in in focus in memory it's true they had kind of smart supplements if you will for years we've known certain ingredients\nHave been able to really empower the brain especially with all the remember it's it's not just genetics that causes you to begin to lose a lot of function in the body it's our environment is the toxicity in the environment so the more we can cut down the toxins in the environment the more we can cause our bodies to thrive\nAnd so that's a huge key with what we have going so I Want to encourage you that that is extremely important and and to make sure to look at that good alpha brain dot com force are asking for brain dot com for such in shape check it out to go look at it\nAnd uh and and you'll notice that I think they give it to you for free by the way a if you get free samples or something like that they'll send you\nBut one thing you want to focus on keeping their fat\nNumber one keeping your fats in about thirty percent of your diet can that's almost walnuts caches avocados fish oils not only is that good for warm on health but it's really good for brain health and then number two is look at paradox all five ... five pie\nAnd it's a it's a version of B. six and then also certainly you\nWant to definitely make sure you've got plenty of a mega three fast coming in along with your with your thirty percent total but number three really want to look at this now because if for memory it's extremely important but it's keeping your protein levels up\nAnd I I like to protein role for people that are athletes K which is one gram of protein per pound a body weight is what I usually it here too and it fluctuates for some people\nSome scientist that you need a little bit more but I think for the average person even for the average athlete\nThat usually gives you enough to maintain muscle tissue to grow to not be taxing on the kidneys and to really get your body into a good level into a good place usually that can be very beneficial so it's good for the brain to name all ... all around if you want to build memory you have to eat the right kind of food\nAnd you got to really I've found that using supplementation is big now you gotta ask yourself a question here's a great marker\nFor how strong your memory is it's not how well you can just remember where your keys are [laughter]\nOkay although that's a good thing you can remember where he's our but one of the big keys is how did you dream last night can you remember your dreams if you're dreaming on a regular basis that means that you're getting number one into a deep stage of sleep we called delta sleep and then number two\nIt also means that\nYour your memory is getting rigid are generated meaning that that you've got the neurons and all the different nerve cells they're working well that you're getting a good a good amount of nutrition and if you don't drink at all there's an issue you you're ... you will eventually start seeing the decline\nIn memory and brain function and cognition that sort of thing just because the deep level slip that our body needs comes from dreaming\nAnd so this strictly important just give you a heads up it's a great little at home test to begin to think about where things are and then of course I'll get to just take some action switch up your diet get more exercise looking looking great products like alpha brain I take that every day and I've noticed a tremendous difference to really have with that", "show_name": "Dr. Asa On Call", "month": "10", "state": "TN", "day": "26", "station": "WLAC", "city": "Nashville"}
