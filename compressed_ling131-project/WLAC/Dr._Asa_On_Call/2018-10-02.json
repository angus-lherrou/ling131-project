costs the American taxpayer seven hundred thousand dollars\n[noise] let's put this in perspective for me a center serving blind veterans has a seven hundred thousand dollar piece aren't on the wall\nIt was to fancy sculptures um and also there was a third one it was a kid rock sculpture\nAll in with landscaping that cost one point two million dollars\nThese findings went to Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley Grassley wrote a three page oversight letter that then the secretary Robert McDonald a McDonald took thirty days but he apologized for the purchases and instituted a new rules to stop the abuse go forward basis\nYou know but it really tells you a lot the website is open the books dot com it really tells you a lot\n... you could make a new provision new regulation that says you can't waste money like this anymore the VA could for instance me I can no longer by art installations of sculpting and you can no longer spend more than point oh one percent of construction on landscaping you could make any regulation you want any provision\nBut at the end of the day the mindset that thought that was okay is not going away and that's far more troubling\nWell Michael you're exactly right so a month after the apology the Palo Alto communications director called a press conference in front of that ugly one point two million dollar coupon ... sculpture\nAnd he said these things are necessary to create a feeling environment for our veterans locally they never backed away from it\nWill know and I'll bet you having served on Houston city council I'll bet you\nThat whoever the art is is that that was commissioned to create that sculpture is somebody involves sister lover husband\nA business partner ... those things are never as simple as just commissioning a piece of art it's always a way to redistribute wealth to contributors supporters friends and family\nAnd here's what every veteran listening to your program today needs to understand so since twenty fourteen so in Phoenix um there was actually\nTwo hundred employees of the Phoenix VA facility while these well forty you know veterans coming to the doctor\nSo we we took a look at our data and we we wanted to ask the question how many doctors are employed and there was only two hundred and twenty seven doctors out of three thousand two hundred employees these things were a employment farm there not medical systems\nIn the in the years that have gone past\nCongress through tens of billions of dollars at the VA we track what they did with it and they they've actually added to the pay roll over sixty thousand new position and less than seven thousand new doctors have been added\nYou know it's just it's just more of the same\n... disturbing it really is ... ... one of the charts that you produced a that I thought was powerful raised the question who has more firepower US Marines versus bureaucrats what did you find there\nWe found that there are now over two hundred thousand federal bureaucrats with arrest and firearm authority and there's only a hundred and eighty two thousand United States Marines\nSpecific to the VA the VA didn't even have a police force in Nineteen Ninety six\nThey relied on like hospitals do on the local police agencies to provide security\nWhile that change starting in Nineteen Ninety six and today the VA has approximately thirty two hundred police officers again while they're failing on their core mission while they're ripping and reading at the secret social promise to provide basic healthcare to the men and women who fought for us\nThey've uh they've spent nearly twenty million dollars over the course last nine years on guns in English and military style equipment to arm their police force every single year they spend about two hundred or two hundred million dollars on salaries for their police force\nOpen the books dot com is where you'll find Adams were one of your ah one of the articles or you see you've been on Fox a lot of ... in Newsweek one of the stories was\nPentagon rushes to spend billions before into month one of the things I found in local government but I'm I'm I'm sure it's true in state and federal as well is that once money is allocated in a budget it's going to be spent otherwise you lose it in next year's budget to what extent is that happening how big a problem is that\nIt's a huge problem so we found that last year on the use it or lose it a blow off spending spree at the federal agencies incredibly Michael one out of every nine dollars of contract\nAnd the executive agencies bender last week they spent ... billion dollars I mean we found small things like the United States Army\nBart dinners for about seven thousand dollars you could buy a lot better it's set in grant you know they brought a shuffle board adult\nOr no board you know the dollar they bought a thirty five thousand dollar arcade machine over and health and Human Services in order to west transaction the grain or by the\nBy a price when he was a secretary they bought it the armored limit ... and they spent one point five\nMillion dollars I Know\nWhat kind of arcade games was it like ... [laughter]\nYou know Hitler and rightfully it's a big party and we actually proved it was a big party the state department's ... grand on whiskey and wine\nOr don't judge I might have spent that much\n\nFor the good work you're doing you can contribute to his cause you can sign up for his newsletter you can read his reports his name is Adam and jet ski you'll never learn how to spell it but you can find him\nAnd open the books dot com open the books dot com appreciate your time I met me Michael thanks for having me on there you have it\nAll right we'll put a link to that on our website at Michael berry dot com you can always send me an email at Michael berry show dot com you can also send remote an email and it says on their sin Ramona direct email our podcasts are available they're free wherever you get your podcasts\nA including through our website Michael berry dot com we do read our emails coming thanks for listening and thanks for telling a friend [noise]\n\nAuthor former chief medical correspondent and slump ... user Dr Bob are not\nThe human body has billions of pain receptors\nBlock those receptors with the anesthetics mounted salon ... plus and you'll have relief\nSlump ... plus ... to anesthetics including the maximum strength light again available that prescription they numb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relieve relieve try what I use salon ... plus in the silver box with blue wage\nTell you about his time in there in the middle of it was a harrowing time during my mother warned me don't go out and play\nMy records thousands and thousands died I was scared and then one day then one day and then one day there was\nBefore vaccines they were the ways to help protect against suddenly illnesses\nDiseases like measles meningitis theory of him being called polio vaccine these can we in March\nTo kill my children to help protect their children kids vaccinated and keep them on schedule I never want my grandchildren to see what I saw\nA public health message from the American Academy of pediatrics supporting provided by standing eight or does it protect tomorrow or remember vaccinate\nBack in high school that's when I started smoking\nAlmost everybody in our crowded [noise]\nLeave go to parties feel awkward and cigarettes became an easy way to deal with that\n[noise] the school was ages ago and I still know [noise]\nIt's not like I haven't tried to quit I tried after college than when I hit thirty\nI have another big birthday coming up to the [noise]\nI Love can be done forever with smoking by than most people say they want to quit smoking but it's not easy it usually takes several\nTries before he quit for good to stop thinking you're a failure because what you really are it's just a normal human being up against a very addictive product is a quarter in you dot org or call one eight hundred lung usa for tools tips and support from the American lung association\nWe support the quid hearing you\nBack in the day smoking was in now quitting well much better\nFrom the company the plumbing and electrical broadcast better this is talk radio not boy three on tell me what I Do find Fifteen ten\n... heart radio station\n... over the nominee I'm Lisa ...

diabetes for a number of years and my doctors telling me that for that reason\nThat some of that I've got some nerve damage that preventing me from um having now some of the warning signs I used to have when my blood sugar levels were dropping down there too low\nAnd so in other words um you know I used to I used to know when I was going to need something to eat or I'm going to need to get me to orange juice or whatever you know and I have some warnings about it now I'm not having some of those warnings and\nSo I'm getting in trouble\nWe I'm sure I mean is it might show my question is is what could I Do to get a ... ... what can I Do to\nReplace the half those nerve ... what can I Do there to get help but\nWell what is the one of the doctors told you so far I mean they're given much of a game plan well ah\nWhat we have ah been doing some things with my influence that helped me out but but it has a you know I still have any moments than when I just don't realize that well I'm going to lead them you're pretty quick\nYou know I'm just not getting that there's a bit going let alone the next thing you know just\nI don't I don't realize that I'm getting in trouble\nI understand [noise] terrible things just\nBut to think about this one you've got to change if you got\nIrritation to the nerves at any level you know it's always good to create a a new dietary plane first you know eating habits are important you can go straight for\nA you know certain supplements and that sort of there but I still think I'm kind of old school in the way of uh I Do believe that you change the way you eat changed the way you live you start exercising and you begin to change the body of all the way around\nSo that really would be kind of the first and foremost spot to go in uh in my opinion okay so talk to me a little bit about your exercise habits are you exercising on a regular basis or not really\nYes survey uh I ride a bicycle five point three miles every morning and when I finished doing that I Walk two miles and that's I'm averages six days a week doing that\nA ... way a hundred and fifty two pounds or you know I'm doing really good in most areas is is that I've just don't I Love those warnings says that\nI guess everybody has a warning sign or two that you would know you know when your blood sugar levels dropping off too low you know about it and I don't know and it it is up I just\nIt's kind of hard to explain it but it is in a ball and over and they don't realize that I'm I'm about to be in trouble\nNow I get that now that the doctors that they have that you're working with they've got you set up in in a routine right you have anyone working with you on a diet and all on your eating habits\nYes I Do and uh I'm eating late protein healthy foods and trying to do everything that I can I just wonder what did I Do to help that nerve damage\nIs there anything you say hey that would improve your nerve damage\nWell as far as the damage goes the nervous system itself is", "city": "Nashville"}
