the lifestyle principles are food really is so powerful and that's what I Love about it because the foods we put inside of our body really do become our body you see our body can only take the the raw materials that we give\nIt and it's either going to make one or two things it's going to make good sales\nOr it's going to make bad cells okay and when we see that every single day in in any type of medical practice we see that that the body either gets healthier or does it and I think now more there's more than ever any options that we see when nutrition\nAnd what to do to to make your body's healthier so I like to highlight different foods and it really talk about what they can do to the body 'cause it's amazing that you could eat something like a a banana ... potassium and it can help your heart right or it's amazing that you could eat kale\nAnd know that it can help support the blood cells or that it can help\nGive you more fiber or if you get fifty grams of fiber a day from vegetables that it can cut your colon cancer is about fifty percent\nWhen you see all that you think okay wow this is amazing so food is our medicine and a lot of different ways and if you eat a bunch of junk food for a long period of time and it can make you really sick if you don't believe that just watch the documentary super size me where the guy fast food for like thirty days and that's all he ate\nAnd look what happened to him\nPretty amazing so we're talking about a food today that the ... super powerful been around in the south where I'm from [laughter] for a long time\nOne of the staples of course the way they cook it here in the south is probably not the best so it's probably better to leave off some of the extras and keep it simple but we're talking about mustard greens mustard greens write so unless or unlike their fellow Khrushchev for vegetables\nThe mustard greens and not really been a direct focus of a lot of studies believe or not it's not the glorified kale and and all these other spinach but it's very powerful and a lot of studies over a dozen studies involving ... vegetables as a group including mustard greens\nAt the top of the list for cancer prevention it appears to be a standout area for mustard greens in summarizing their health benefits and the connection between mustard greens and cancer prevention\nShouldn't be surprising because it's in the same family as a lot of the other leafy ... uh the dark green leafy greens that we have but there's a strong three key areas don't want to talk about with mustard greens okay it is\nThe bodies detox system you know the body does have its own detoxification system during the liver and they'll emphatic system\nWe our body has an amazing detox system okay so sometimes you just have ... ... is the right kind of foods to activate it so it it really goes and it helps the bodies detox it helps it antioxidants system right to protect the cells any auction systems are shield\nTo protect ourselves and then third it's inflammatory anti inflammatory system so the chronic imbalances in any of these three systems can increase the risk of cancer and went imbalances and all three systems occur\nSimultaneously the risk of cancer\nIncreases significantly to almost among all types of cancer prevention and the following cancer types or most closely associated with the rest of mustard greens bladder cancer breast cancer colon cancer lung cancer\nProstate cancer and ovarian cancer okay so the detox support which provided by the mustard greens is pretty strong\nAnd that's what's interesting about it is you can cook them you can blend them in a in a smoothie you can make a big salad with it you just don't add a bunch of stuff to it I personally have to get to keep it simple you gotta garlic saute it it's it's phenomenal and what it can do\nBut the mustard grades detox portion I think is very cool to talk about because what happens is the body has this phase one face to detox vacation where sulfur containing nutrients boost is face to\nEnd the mustard greens contain fight of nutrients called glucose eliminates that can help activate the detoxification enzymes and regulate their activity\nSo three of these glucose when they are really important if we fail to give our bodies detox system adequate nutritional support it does not work and the cool thing about the mustard greens is that they work as such an easy way\nAnd they keep a lot of cells from becoming cancerous which is amazing so we're talking about mustard greens and food is medicine check out our website anytime get in shape\nNetwork\nAnd check that out we got a lot more of the articles and things that we talked about there but the antioxidant benefits of mustard greens or a really strong too and remember antioxidants oxidation is what happens in the cells so when you have\n... ... anything from sunlight which I Know supposed to be good for us but you've got chemicals in the environment these can come in and potentially over used them can damage themselves right they oxidized is that poor air quality\nCreate these ...\nThese oxidation in the cells well the antioxidants that we get from a fruits and vegetables can make a difference or like the shield but the mustard greens come in and they're an excellent source of vitamin C. vitamin e", "city": "Nashville"}
