VW the VFW hall don't say that down the VFW off your speaking before the American legion don't tell them that ... that\nDon't say that to the cops course it looks like almost all the cops have endorsed Ted Cruz so we'd product and winning cops in a way\nSo why don't you just call the cops the new Jim Crow which he did I guess that was designed to wind black votes\nThey're black cops to their black people that are protected by cops and their families there are blacks who were family members of victims of blacks who shot at cops are fought cops but I guess if you weren't going to win the cops anyway 'cause you don't like law enforcement 'cause they've arrested you on two different occasions\nOne for trying to flee the scene of a drunk driving accident\nAnd another for attempted burglary I guess if you really don't like the cops anyway it comes naturally to\nYou to insult them I wouldn't call that courage and I wouldn't call that Texan but the beauty is starting on Monday in Texas we have\nThe first day of early voting and I'm going to ask you today when you get home to take a moment look it up and see where your early voting locations are here me out on this ... this is important\nWhenever you go in to vote\nEarly voting is typically in the county that you live in not where you work the county where you live now there will be some distinctions the parishes of Louisiana for instance there will be some quirks in each state look it up it's probably very easy\nSpend just a few moments on the inter webs look it up figure it out and then for a lot of folks early voting will start next week\nLook up when early voting starts and where you can early vote devote five minutes to it's not going to be that hard don't rely on the guy down the hall look it up on your own\nYour secretary of state's office or your vote a registrar which is usually a secretary of state will have a very easy how to\nGo and vote for the first day\nPlease vote straight Republican all the way down the ticket and a lot of places you can just choose Republican\nRight out of the gate and you don't have to ... you just choose every Republican who's on the ballot and that's it that's it and you're done you don't have to go down you're going to be tempted to go man on\nThese judges down he's state rep I don't know these people\nWell those are the people who have supported the party platform that you've supported and don't support the party of Hillary Clinton and ...\nIf nothing else that puts them a leg up on the Democrats voted early absolutely positively vote early on the first day you you can don't wait till election day\nNow you're going to hear that election day is November six please do not wait until November ... we're going to have a window that's going to open it's going to be different in each of the states that you live in\nAnd I think probably most folks are going to start next week there'll be a few days sometimes up to two weeks where you can vote early\nGo in and vote and be done and no you did your part the other thing when you get to the voting location I tell you what the rules are in Texas I Can't speak to the other states\nBring your passport bring your voter id registration card if you have it bring your driver's license but if you can't find what you think they need grabbed the forms of identification you know you have and go in there and insist\nThat you cast a vote there are a lot of volunteers and folks that are temporary workers that may say no you can't vote with a asked\nWe're going to Bob Bob\nWhat my mom\nAnd my stepmother and that was me\nAnd I found my\nTrip we're pretty good [noise] okay\nWhen was the only problem is going up and it\nWas five foot [noise]\nAnd I'm from\nShe would balance mother mean one of the big things you want to watch out is one is the cerebellum is a big piece and you're like what is that well it's part of the brainstem that goes on to the\nFirst cervical Verna bra and it's always good to have someone to evaluate that if it's out of position then it can start causing some balance issues so that can be one one deal to look at and then obviously your inner ear to be an issue to have looked at your primary care physician can look at that\nAnd ah and do some evaluation on that there's some testing that can be done some but it will invest tubular testing to see if there's anything neurological barbecue can be causing some of the balance related issues and vascular components\nTo might want to have them run some vascular test to see exactly what's going on as far as if there's some restrictions if there's blacking or in the carotid mean there's an ultrasound test that really simple non invasive and they can do and run\nAnd see that's a major issue so again there's several things that you can do and I would get that done especially if you have an uh an ... that they know about then there's probably some instability is\nWithin irrational system that's what I'll take a peek at 'cause really that\nInto something you don't want to just let\nYou go from a natural perspective your fatty acids are important like a fish oils that's very very important vitamin e is a big one too if you're not take any medicine right now\nThan you might want to talk to your doctor's about those because raising a vitamin e levels and also your mega three fats are just incredible routine is another really good one for vessels\nThat you might want to take a peek at a as well but again I Would get someone to work on the structural aspect\nOf your health because the structure meaning the bones muscles nurse ... physicians really good osteopathic physicians deals are very good at this as well\nAnd that can be a real good component with what your struggle with what you're looking at OK and that can be very helpful especially in a situation where you're losing that balance and being able to figure out the route and and you get back ... to eight three Seventy seven

a new tier I medical I mean the icy AOL dot com\nYou need it may\nJust important I'm just I'm a big fan of that now number three key number three is to get blood testing done every six months you're over age thirty you definitely need to get blood testing done for\nA nutritional evaluation at least every six months the blood changes every Ninety two hundred and twenty days and because we know that we need some form of evaluation tool to be able to see exactly what's going on or a blood powers in the blood life is in the blood\nNow we're pretty soon we're gonna be talking about some DNA testing that's come down the pipeline for nutrition but for a good moderate standard and they can afford testing the blood testing is really really good and something to look into your doctor can do it many sometimes insurance will cover sometimes it won't\nBut you need to get with a company to that can do a nutritional valuation based on those numbers and that's important because you want to see what's going on your body and if your radical changing your lifestyle you want to know that the things that you're doing every single day are making a difference in those numbers if the numbers change means your body is changing it means you're getting healthier\nEvery single day so that is key number three did your blood tests done every six months not every year\nInto doctor says we'll see in a

office visit\nAll right key number four drink plenty of water we don't drink enough water every single day and that does not include sodas so sugary drinks and all that you're not counting AT T's I'm okay with cheese black tea green tea Kevin ... do you want to count that liquid as part of it that's cool\nBut your water and take every single day needs to be half your body weight minimum if you exercise or you're an athlete probably about twenty percent more on top of that\nRight\nSo you want to do if you're a hundred and fifty pounds you'd be Seventy five ounces of water every single day your body is made of water and so if we don't hydrated ourselves and get enough the body can't function\nAt its peak levels so it's critical to get enough of water\nEvery day [noise] make sure you get

healthy talk radio next [noise]\n[noise] your greatest wealth and kick it off and go with Terri Hi Terry\nWelcome to the show [noise] are you doing I'm living well what's up [noise]\nAnd I figure it out\nYou can tell me whatever you need to tell me about yourself go for\nThe ... oh yeah [laughter]\nI'm like oh I got a three way not white people aren't in my own right I've been out here lately I went down but Russia and it's like oh\nWhy oh why oh why oh why oh why not if they want a way to get\nIt on that little machine that hyper ... and here lately but I get real I have breathing problems but there's nothing wrong\nWith anything that I Know a right\nTo your question is you're worried about the high blood pressure is it something that you need to go look at medication is that what you're wanting to know what's\nGoing on and what what's going on what could be out of it out I Know I don't eat right I I Love it may well now you\nWant to ask me that question again so you're wondering what's wrong but you love the fried chicken mashed potatoes all the time\nAnd you know not not but I I Know it\nAll right well why don't we\nWhy don't you tell me this what did you have the day for breakfast lunch and dinner and let me be the judge of where your which diet\nOr right this moment to a\nFat guy but hey there you go around as far as the reading this book I eat a hamburger steak and baked potato and a salad bar at three o'clock ... o'clock in the area so you you didn't eat all day 'til three o'clock\n[noise] not like oh no\nThat's\nOkay that's that's fantastic especially when you're doing high blood pressure so that's a perfect diet\nThat you think yeah it's horrible let me tell you this here's the deal OK\nCan eat that way for a period of time and your life and you won't see much of an issue with it or your your early twenties\nAnd all that you can eat like that unless you got some some major issues and you you probably won't see much records from that you're getting your forties in their late thirties forties and fifties and start eating that when a regular basis you're going to say things like blood pressure diabetes cholesterol issues even cancer\nSo\nOne of the main things you gotta get focused on is learning and teaching yourself how to eat healthy what does that even mean\nAnd you being a truck driver what you know what is that going to look like for you to be able to prepare your food pack your food and\nAnd then also being able to eat well on the road so there's that's that's a very long conversation right now there's resources that you can get to to help you\nThere's a whole food list in my book empowering your health is our our get well university program that has a eight CDs and it and you do one CD per week and for you driving that'll be a great tool for you because you can really learn how to get healthy\nFrom a disease of the book gives you the basics the CDs give you the details and that really goes hand in hand that is a good piece too\nBut for the most part with blood pressure first thing you want to do is you want to go go to the doctor tell them about your blood pressure let them know that you're you're getting on a game plan meaning that you're getting ready to radically change your life you're getting ready to look into an exercise program which I Know after this conversation\nThat you will be [laughter] and because it's going to be a part of it you know and if that means driving a truck and a lot of the truckers I talk with they take breaks in the middle of the day and I'll stop for five hours in their trip\nOr go to a truck stop they'll get out walk all around the truck stop at a fast pace for\nFifteen twenty minutes get the blood flowing into metabolism moving and then they'll do it again at their at their deal at night they'll stop at night or when they're getting ready to crash out from the Knight if they're on long trips and they'll go and they'll walk again in the evening and get another round\nIn a for the day so there's different ways to do it where it doesn't really measure schedule up too much and you can stay on track with the timeframe that you're looking at\nFor your trips but exercise is a big key it's it's huge in this but the ... you need to let them know the reason I'm telling you that is because if you go on to your doctor your blood pressure started el ... they want to put you on say ten milligrams of ... whatever they're looking to do or what they decide to do\nAnd they think you need to get started they might not do that if they can trust that you're really going to get serious about your lifestyle in diet and change some things\nAnd they'd be willing to monitor you probably every eight to twelve weeks and see where your blood pressure is and tell you things like well if your blood pressure slowly begins to go up within the next eight to twelve weeks you need to come back and they were going to do something but if you come up with a game plan of\nYou know changing your different lifestyle choices then that can make a difference you see what I mean so it's got to be up to use a little bit you're at that when you get to the
