[noise]\nOn friday I guess it was the morning after she passed and I wasn't sure if I Would say something today or tomorrow\nBecause I'm not very good with those things and I start ball and um but I Will just say this um there is in every person something that we can take from their life um\nTheir greatest assets that I think all of us can be better from and I'm\nRuth berry who I referred to as grandma bury 'em my dad's mother had many many of those traits in fact I'm much like my father\nProbably the most St like human being I've ever met in my life I Know everybody's grandmother is special to them\nUh I Know everybody's grandmother has something that you remember fondly but actually I don't remember a grandma bury her famous dishes or or things like that what I remember most about her was a person of fierce independence\nAnd strength and dignity she was widowed um\nShe was widowed when my grandfather died in a car wreck or coming back from Louisiana and I think it was a lot harder back then there were fewer programs there were\nFewer things to lean upon so she went to work as a cafeteria workers in the western start school district where she probably started\nThere in her mid ... maybe even her late thirties [noise]\nIt's hard for a woman who's not been in the workforce to enter the workforce without any\nDegrees without any experience without a resume without any\nReferences I'm so she became a lunch lady\nCafeteria lady and she was everything that you would want in the cafeteria lady she Puerto heart and soul in that she took great pride in it [noise] um and she ended up getting a full retirement from there I Am and I bet she worked\nA bet she she worked thirty five years as a cafeteria worker and she started later the most but somewhere along the way she never remarried somewhere along the way she picked up in the evening job as well she went to work at hallmark\nShe worked there were two hallmarks but there's still Marshall\nYou don't see them anymore but she worked at the hallmark and orange and then she worked at the hallmark in a rut city and I will tell you that I don't think\nI'm certain that there was never a graduation birthday unit everybody in our for you knew that everybody else might forget to get you a card but to grandma Barry cards were very important and there was never an occasion when that was missed and even when my boys came along\nIt was just like clockwork inch shoot she was in her nineties by then\nIt's not easy to go get a card when you're in your nineties [noise]\nBut what I admire about her was her absolute strength here was a woman who had raised her children the youngest where I think probably finishing high school when my dad was second to the oldest\nUm there was a local gene then my dad Norman and then\nI don't know the order after that Sylvia\nSheila and Sandra so I'm\nIn any case she had raise these children she was a housewife that was um\nThat was a point of great pride to her and her husband dies she has to go to work and never asked a person for a soul lived very simply\nSaved provided for her own healthcare when she was older or something to be said for that there's something to be said for\nThe strengths of independence especially for a woman at a time like that when there were not a lot of economic opportunities\nBut her house was always the the gathering place for our entire family\nUm and I just\nYou know when I when you think about who you are as a person I don't know how much of who we are\nAs we're developing we choose to be and how much of who we are we are because we see things in other people that we want to replicate or is that becomes the norm\nThat becomes you know what you expect\nA woman is supposed to be that becomes what you expect the man is supposed to be that's what you expect a father or grandmother or whatever else [noise]\nBut in any case she had a good life in a long life\nShe lived to be Ninety eight in January she would have been Ninety nine I was really really hoping she lived to be a hundred\nUm but due to a number of health issues her quality of life was not what it had been up until just a few years ago um she had a wonderful quality of life and that was no longer the case and it is it's difficult I don't get to orange as often as I should but\nI Would get frequent reports on her health updates and they were not um they were not what ideally you would hope\nAnd I have a battery in like just the loop recorder and I have the base it on my bed at night\nAnd the other one night carry on this side of my lake every day\nOr so a lot going on I Would I Would do this [noise]\nSo when you get frustrated that are not frustrate but when you get into a place like that where it can be frustrating okay\nWhen you have so many things going on you know where to start here's where you start you start with the ability to know that you want to get well not maybe if it happens one day but that you're in you're in it for a fight that you're willing to do what it takes no matter how hard it might be okay\nThat you want to do everything you can to be able to push your body to that next level\nSo one of the key is you have to look at and this is what I was focusing on is to make sure that you you do everything you can and and this is what I mean by that if you're if you're going to eat right then create a plan and eat that way don't fear from it if you want it if you want to get well\nIf you don't they didn't want matter but the other thing too is your exercise can be important\nEven with with your situation you've got to find out your limitations that the doctor says how you can do this you can walk every day I don't want your doing heavy weights but you can walk every day I don't want your doing sprint but you could maybe walk her swim\nSo you find out what the doctors cool with based on what they have done to your body at this point where the bodies limitations are where the deficiencies are\nAll that kind of thing you figure out what those limitations are and then you build from there\nSo that's the ultimate key\nIs you build a game plan now when it comes down to these other issues I Would focus in on getting a good solid plant first and then go from with the other areas you start naming off the other conditions\nYou've got to get your primary lifestyle set up done first that has to happen before anything else once you get that done\nThen that will build your routine that can help you with your heart functioning better cholesterol levels being better energy levels being better hormone systems working better like an all starts with one area and you build from there okay that's the key\nNow also when you when you think about this you got to think about sleep patterns I'll tell you a big secret with the heart\nIs getting good sleep\nIs making sure you get into deep stage of sleep that's one of the major pieces that were really help you win more than
