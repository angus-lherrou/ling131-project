I was a captain of the team for the hours you're Hayden Fry was it really yeah\nI got um my mom don't roll your eyes but a few years ago\nThe uh um\nTouchdown club I got to to deliver the tribute to Hayden Fry is that right and let me tell you something that guy you're talking about a life will lift he was the first coach in what was it was just southwest Congress he ... he was the first coach himself was Congress to have a black player\nAnd it was a ...\nA a social worker with off because you're in you're in a great guy\nUm he was the first\nAnd I think it was at SMU so he had the first black player I picked up almost like in a major Texas College football yeah the first black player at the University of Iowa which he had coached and he had done so many things and it was kind of like bum village\nYou think of them in in whatever you know Jersey or uniform are kept that there were but you find out that these guys ... same way you don't realize ...\nHad a whole or a new portion to his career right you know some of these guys they coached at it so many different places with so many different legends and you don't know it it's incredible\nYeah I Know after he left a heck of a legacy\nHe did the Justinian touch\nYeah and I I noticed sons very well uh Zack in Randy so I Know guys very well and when I was the universe churches first by scholarship player ever the University of Texas was in my freshman class named Julius Whittier well he was a great football player UT and he just he died a couple of weeks ago\nIt it works well with me and and again with my schedule and in my day to day it just I like be a score bay vitamin C. it's more of a\nA absorb all will form of vitamin C. it adds minerals in there to absorb as well so I really liked this orbit vitamin C can get that of course at our website just go to in shape network dot com and all whole food based organic all that sort of thing just check it out in shape network dot com but I really like vitamin C. I add that into my\nOwn routine but it's a great way to get something on patients a great way to get what you need if you're missing it from food but\nAgain I'm a big fan of making sure that you eat your fruits and vegetables I mean I'm really old school like that because I Would just lean too much on the pill there's no silver bullet I mean I literally have people call me or emailed me and asked me and they say what I Want the silver bullet I Want to eat my doughnuts and I want the silver bullet\nI'm like it doesn't work like that\nIt just doesn't differ marshals might tell you it does but it doesn't really work like that so\nAgain it's about getting food in your body that you need and vitamin C is and isn't so much of what we\nCan eat but we just donate\nSo it's about ... whole good whole foods for its muscles back in your diet and you'll see a massive increase\nIn your immune system and how well your body does AAA to eight three seven to seven to that's AAA to eight three Seventy seven to give us a call go to the website good in shape network dot com we want us to get in shape physically mentally emotionally\nYour body where it needs to be get wife where it needs to be getting in shape something my coach used to always tell me when I played sports is time to get in shape the off season got to get on the in season so it was time to get in\nQuestion is are you in are you in shape you ready for your everyday or you're ready to face\nWhat's coming because you know we are given genetics but again it's only ten percent of it if you're eating healthy doing great with your health then the chances of health challenges come knocking on your door pretty slim it's got to the phones and go to Dana Hi Dana\nHow I wanted to ask a question about her whole in politics is any natural way to get rid of him other than having an operation and have them removed [noise]\nYeah it's it's it's it's tough call I mean the Colin Powell just one of the things you gotta look at is I mean when you go to your corner ... they're going to typically removed them if they if they feel like they can\nSo that's pretty typical I mean there's there's different theories and alternative medicine natural medicine for that but it's not it's not standard of care by any means okay so you can look at ... and how they can help dissolves just engrossed in the body when the body doesn't break proteins down very\nWell that can happen but one of those things where the GI docks you got it down so well in the research is so strong with removing the the ... or the or the pops and the digestive tract and in the colon rather a\n... that it's worth just getting it done and and and sometimes I mean if they're ... and they know they are they just leave and then depending on the location so it's gonna be up to your doctor to kind of advice you on that but it's not a wasted surgery by any means and usually they can get it done\nPretty easily so I've just been curse on that but your eating habits remember if you if you're concerned about prevention kick up your fiber it's it's proven now that's proven in the research about about thirty to thirty five grams a day of fiber is is a good goal I mean the average American probably get\nFifteen grams of fiber which is is awful I mean if you look at cancer\nAt the list of of what's hot in in the high on the cancer list it believe it or not lung cancer is the biggest one thirty three percent and then it drops down to ... to ... next in line got prostate and\nAnd the others but I mean it's it's a big deal so it comes down to our eating so what it's funny because it's not funny at all but it's interesting I guess that's a better word\nThat our environment is what plays the biggest role in the cancers that we deal with so lung cancer you got our air quality which were indoors most of the day and then if you work in the city\nWhere the air quality is not that great\nThen you're getting around that and then if you smoke you you had that on top of it but I mean really thirty three percent lung cancer and then you've got colon which is next\nAnd that has to do with what we eat every single day so you look at the different toxins that we're getting in our food supply water supply all that that makes a tremendous difference in what happens so\nIt just be encouraged I mean all you gotta do is put the right kind of food in it can make a big difference\nOn a regular basis all the way round but cancer is no joke\nYou want to do everything you can with Apollo ups on the prevention side it's just we our
