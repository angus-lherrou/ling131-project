welcome\nNew North American trade pact I'm from a food safety standpoint what's new on that front\nWhere you've got here is a not a a man massive change in the way that this is on but they modernize some of the language and and tried to standardize some of the practices across three different markets and as you can imagine this is\nA sensitive topic uh people not just\nHaving [noise] why they have confidence in their own country's food safety assessments but also\nYou don't want to be at most certainty that the practices in Mexico and ending casting off in the U.S and by and large to the the us has taken the view that that these things are a reliable\nAnd then the other countries it depends on the product and and there's a range of things but\nThe last time this language was a really updated was something there twenty three years ago and so\nThere's been a lot of advance of in that time as you can imagine the food industry here in the U.S and particularly as it was taken out of bigger or policing some of these things which is the you know its own debate but this is why one of the key things worked out here to\nDo with the food safety front\n... I I I think there was somebody in your stories of something a little lines that there seems to be momentum right now for the American farmer on the trade front is that this is that a widely held belief\nWell I think it depends who you ask and probably uh how they're either bank account to work in right now you know depending on what a proper or livestock they produce and how much they've been hit by lower prices but a\nA comment about momentum came from a place where you know the farmers on the farm sector this goes for the agricultural companies to they've been watching it but a year's worth the headlines and things have been going into a direction where there was more a question\nUh in terms of the U.S and its relationship with its major trading partner is you know Mexico Canada\nThe EU China and so on and uh so the reference the momentum there was a trade deal and updated thing that a President Trump signed last week with South Korea\nWhich has a significant market and then in Asia for us agricultural and food exports and are they now spends with Mexico came before that a few weeks time and now with Canada looking like they're going to\nShore up the NAFTA or of the NAFTA was and move forward or something and so that's\nThe reference to momentum is been after you know quite a few months here of uncertainty", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "02"}
