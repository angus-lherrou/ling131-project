victims not always willing to come forward the reasons are many years this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics of what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people go over the details again\nA and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system has taken over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so there's a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often but sometimes I there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong\nI went to that party I had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not\nAnd so there is a self blame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there's some evidence of physical harm why is that\nBecause then they face feels like they will be beliefs of the huge fear is that I Am going to put myself out there I'm going to relive my trauma and no one's going to do it publicly people now nobody shameful details it's you know facts as a private thing to begin with even when it's consensual and nice\nAnd people are going to know these horrible details in my life and no one's going to believe me right so these these physical injuries that somebody has or at least physical person they're they're visible press that um something happened to me\nLet's talk about um the victims who actually know the person which seems to be somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives employing a ... like that does that make it that much more complicated\nYes especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this person in the hall you see this person around the country club wherever you are and so um you're you're scared aid that they will get angry at you and there'll be some retaliation and um but you're also scared of being ostracized so\nUh you know will people again in this victim blaming society will people say that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's something called cognitive dissonance when something we can get our mind around some things that we for someone says hey this person you know\nUltimately what if we know that person to be a really good person and I can't get might just the bystander I Can't get my

they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Want to offer but\nI wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really\nDo you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and I know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office X. rated the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't\nYeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure it's okay but he did it yes so that he can steal stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this yeah law something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restrict or the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second we use of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the the trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination ...\nHand so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nI'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know how we ... store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point though\nYou'd you'd actually have families coming together to make a gift costume ...\nAnd what you find is that the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as Warren ... classic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing is turned into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nUm and this is when you started getting adults who are you doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the the sexy police officer or to drag\nYeah and of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a amassed trapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ... a good question you know I think that um you know when I mentioned I mean it's\nIt's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all the ... day and and you know we with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think is probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far or in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like ours with them stopped it's like a scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think he's really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any of the faith and creed hum ... who does like address how we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid with an eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors national for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or

why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report on a on a fault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people go over the

life is good right but could it be too good yes Stamford Conn economic business trends analyst he shakes his head at the amount of debt that we've accumulated he's based in Long Beach California ... what kind of economy are we looking at\nWhat we're looking at it a a a comment that's doing well I Can't argue with the numbers is doing well but what are the debt bubble car to me that all bubbles eventually burst you cannot keep going economy can't keep going by adding more debt faster than the economy is growing and that's exactly what we're doing and the quality of the debt now\nIs actually worse than it was at the peak in two thousand seven right before we had the financial crisis\nSo we've got a real problem now you got a debt induce financial bubble outlook you think this is going to go on forever course got no bubbles go on forever they are ... they all burst I Can't tell you when but no one could tell you where ... is\nThe debt it's a government and consumers are we just talking about bad can so hard that you know\nIt's it's both I'll give you an example um all that both from municipalities and corporations are the debt now over a little over fifty percent of the debt from is a power these that'd be like a couple of government states and uh incorporation corporate that\nLittle over fifty percent is rated junk or one notch above junk when to me that's all junk in two thousand seven about twenty seven percent of that that was raided junk or one notch above jock\nSo you know you take if you take your pick or we're worse off now than we weren't two thousand seven and those people get into bond funds better\nBe careful about the rating on those bonds because all those bonds are very low rate it they could be junk or a little bit above jock and there are a little bit above junk they're called investment grade but to me if you're a little bit above junk it's joke\nIs that how did we find these new depths what happened\nAfter we climbed these new debt what was the question again\nHow did we find them well how do how do we get back to the worst then we weren't oh seven\n... because of the fed lowers interest rates near zero for a long for a number of years so people went out and borrowing money like mad they issue a debt and they just had a dead end is financial bubble and the economy did grow in a work\nBut all all trends come to an end they don't go on forever and now the fed is reversing itself\nAnd guess what interest rates are going up the ten year treasury note went above three percent it still is about three percent if it starts climbing higher\nGet out of the people borrowed money at low interest rates lower rates going up that's that'll print the financial bubble especially if the year when the ten year treasury note goes about three and a quarter percent and it's that's going to four percent the game is over that's it the gate all financial gains come to an end\nAnd this one eventually come to an end to so this is matter of whether you're going to be caught in the middle\nSo start preparing for yourself now because this they will not last forever\nSanford Sanford John economic business trends analyst from California twenty two minutes now in front of the hour on this weekend\nAbout life insurance what did you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you call ... life for example Georgia's forty he was getting\nAbsolutely had to exactly what we did with one of our clients just a a last week where we initially set out to close a shirt location and\nAnd then it's like wait a minute he lives out in Murfreesboro let's just close in Murfreesboro Tenn early within thirty minutes one email boom done\nThere's certainly no problem we uh we we ... we move close loans and pretty much\nAbout anywhere but we let you know traffic gets busier around town and people getting busier it becomes harder and harder for people to get the closings now as we've talked before come July of two thousand and nice to have like drawing a notary so maybe you can just do it from home and your bathrobe I don't know but until then we look forward to seeing you at\nAt our offices they are yeah heck yeah so what's what is ... what am I not paying or what am I saying or what am I what am I saving money on here what are we\nMan let's let's set off a first defined what PM I as people here that P. M. I. M. I. more of an insurer might be it might be it's all the same thing and Freddie Mac defines ... area my as an insurance policy that protects the lender\nIf you use the homeowner and unable to pay your mortgage it's a monthly fee to throw it into your mortgage payment that is required for all conforming conventional loans and if they say that have less than twenty percent down payment\nThen once you have ... percent equity in your home you can see your M. I. P. or ... whatever you want to call it and remove the expense from your mortgage payment however if you have an essay Che mortgage\nIt is on there for life unless you purchase live alone by federal law yeah it's not your life yeah not our life or your life is all modern um some of the older more an effigy mortgages um [noise] had a five year cancellation them but everything that's new everything that's been originated in the last couple of years\nIs subject to the lifetime in my requirement until you paid alone off [noise]\nSo that is am I and\nI always tell people what closings I said it's if if you default on your note that's it and the lender\nComes in legally takes the house back from you for the collateral from you which is called the foreclosure process the lender will go to the insurance company up and they will cash in their insurance policy that says\nThis guy didn't pay please give me my money and so what happens is you no longer have a problem with the mortgage company no you have a problem with the mortgage insurance company who settled with the fact of trying to collect that data from you\nOr any deficiency between what the house sold at at a foreclosure and what you owe the bank\nBack yet this summer as what he just said he wanted to do that you're even going yeah ... you don't want any part of it [laughter]\nUm I mean it's to me and I tell clients of maybe talk to me on the phone talking about the mortgage I Will fly I'll tell you you don't want to pay more of a difference it is a waste of money it's a necessary evil that you have to deal with [laughter] so why are buying\nSomething for the protection of the lender because you you may not have the entire twenty percent down payment ... so the only person that benefits from mortgage insurance is the more insurance company that Linder yeah\nNow why am I now saying the cost of not paying mortgage insurance because that is a sharp contrast to what I normally say [laughter] and normally preach and here's the deal\nFor people do pay it because they don't have a twenty percent down payment and other than to stop people from getting a loan they still can get alone you know but they just may be subject to the private mortgage insurance I Want to say that\nNo that's exactly and that's exactly where I wanted to go with this because a lot of people are still the fun of but that's OK many people think why can't buy a house unless I have twenty percent\nWell no that's not correct because that's where the ... the mortgage insurance comes into into effect to help you put down as little as three percent five percent and in some cases we can do zero percent you know there's there's a lot of options so that's when paying PM I or mortgage insurance\nIs a good thing because think about it from this point of view\nIf and we talked about this throughout all of the today show\nWith the way properties are ... appreciating year over year over year you buy a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house today and use the appreciation of six percent through the next five years the house is now worth nearly three hundred thousand dollars\nAll right then you turn around and look at the mortgage insurance on it and over that same five year period [noise] you're gonna pay sixty six hundred dollars a mortgage insurance\nSo you just games fifty thousand dollars in equity through appreciation\nSubtract out the sixty six hundred bucks and mortgage insurance that helped you participate and being a homeowner and she'd taken you know taking control that uh appreciation instead of paying rent to somebody else so they're probably can appreciate instead of yours and you've just let it out forty three thousand dollars\nOkay we'll get much uh yeah I mean it's it's printing money for yourself and don't don't forget about the fact every month to make a payment\nYou're paying yourself because you're paying down the principal every single month whereas when you're renting you're given that entire check to your landlord to pay their mortgage and the pay their principal down you don't get any credit from your rent whereas you write your Thirteen hundred bucks or sixteen hundred or two thousand dollars a month [laughter]\nPart of that goes to paint on your principles we're moving the money from your left the you're right pocket to your left pocket essentially and you're forced savings so\nA couple of things come to mind you guys can get a little creative with our mortgage insurance works rye following it very creative with it so I mean meaning like sometimes you can pre pay it can be pre paid to where it's not built into the monthly Simon yep we can that's called\nSingle a mind where you have no monthly him my cost cannot even built into the payments\nIt's not built into the payment all increases your clothes and costs just a tad but yet when you run the numbers and let me tell you if you can read your bank statement every month you can see these numbers I'm going to be able to give me an single in my versus monthly am I and be like ... that makes a whole lot more sense to go single a mine\n... free paying to be done with it you can have the lender ... right yeah\nSo there's a lot of options other than just saying hey one box that's all you fit in here and here's your here's your mortgage insurance premium now mortgage insurance costs wise is is kind of a moving target a little bit in it and I mean depending on what are some of those factors that that affects what pricing cost on that\nCredit score your ... your amount that you put down your debt to income ratio and literally it's almost it's the exact same way that we price out\nA conventional loan it looks at all the same uh ... level adjustments and it prices ... led does exact same thing but what a mortgage insurance premium right you pay for so the higher your score below or the ... and as your score starts to drop dead and starts to become a game of where\nIt might be cheaper for you to go with an F. ha loan because the ... in my is one set premium across the board regardless what your credit score so\nThat's what we do in in in helping to advise you but this is also why I can tell you if you're out there just re shopping and you're looking for the lowest cheapest possible raped\nAnd you've got a you know good credit score\nYou're going the wrong direction because\nYou may put yourself into an effigy a mortgage because F ha rates are cheaper the conventional rates there historically a quarter to have a point cheaper everyday but yet if you're just focus on just that rate\nAnd not the actual monthly payment you are going to pay every month I can sit there and show your conventional loan that blows away your\nEssay Che payment even though the conventional retire\nA point in time where as I say mortgage and ... what you if you had an F ha loan and Morgan insurance you could get it removed from the loan they change that there was All right this there was a point in time so many some folks maybe thinking while I thought that that would come all at once I reached twenty percent so there was a point in time when that would happen\nBut when it's but once the recession going to happen and as I say about bankrupt I guess the way to explain that they felt that they had to continue the bump up its reserves and by doing that they are required to get the mortgage insurance for the duration of alone now if you wanted to get rid of that and yet it\nMany of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat but um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produced paper trail\nUm and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't do\nThat you point out there's really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of back up\nSo um yeah so so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can't be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other either you need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are looking at that paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalists also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got to be running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so
