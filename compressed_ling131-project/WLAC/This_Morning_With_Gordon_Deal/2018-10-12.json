listening to America's this morning\nThen if we can get along with ... thanks\nFor joining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is lurk has this to the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nFor point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places in New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I covered this all the time and I know that right to to be a paper than ah it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six per than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nI'm with that said though I think we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sentiment that it has been in the past that I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high\nAnd I think the second is because we saw a huge run up in prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the higher rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner had the rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway\nA full percentage point at least below where rates are now so there are no the the odd person out there maybe they had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a more or less a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nWe're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing\nAbove price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in front of the more expensive markets um but I went to somebody hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a\nNew York we're seeing or hearing more and more about price production so\nWhat does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought the biggest jump within and rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prices are still high but I Do think for buyers that just got\nExhausted I'm from a bidding war as and cash fire that my real friends say that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers who want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices down were to bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nFortunate the program is brought you buy Brooklyn

thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they've worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of gigs condom your workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payment cycles um you know everyday workers are now\nSaying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me [laughter] so without conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and that kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of\nThe national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that as a benefit for their workers some of these companies um are you know that that allow you to outsource both are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often\nSo we may see it sort of position that way and
