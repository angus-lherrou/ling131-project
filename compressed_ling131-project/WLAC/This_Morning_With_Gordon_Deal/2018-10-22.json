so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship so they were saying that that was happening they followed that with the ship fall for getting hit by torpedoes and having her

America's wars in the morning when\n\nWeather is walking into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorite to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of at no word that they can they not cycle and people didn't think would become competitive back in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than people expect that they would\nAnd we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge amount [laughter] so maybe at forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent districts you know that he comfortably carried by where there is more room for a Democrat [laughter] to pick up votes if people have become dissatisfied with the president and\nThat's a one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie How Arab butler [noise]\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or\nHas been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman butler and Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm the incumbent advanced as the the highest performing Democrat who it is a woman named ... she's a political science professor [laughter]\nSo it's an unusual way Steyer and that um it hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points [laughter] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great\nWell All right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYeah probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent\nAnd this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women are\nShow more of a preference for a democratic controlled house and are often more energized this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out but\nIf that is indeed the case it looks like a women are more place to turn out and that could help some of these came out challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the vote to not a huge\nThe blowout for him there\nGot it we're speaking with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tighten as mid term elections near our data about down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\n[noise] yes this is an interesting wait a second what all is definitely being outweighed by Carolyn a boy do who is also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been one of more like classic suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while\nOne of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that [noise] um but go could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\n[laughter] this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um [noise] there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and at to those you know they can see Republicans feel they have a better shot rather than an feeding a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crap and hardy [noise] uh and then the second that is either a public hands are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter]\nExcept those two things that are contributing to\nI thought I saw that in your story which basically said like the rate of teen pregnancies from like Nineteen Seventy or the seventies has been cut in half from then to today that about right yes\nYes that's true it's a way way down on and yeah that that get an education partly um plays a role and I'm abortions are actually falling as well so it's not just that\nUm you know there are more portions happening it's um that there's actually a decline in sexual activity on the rise and birth control so it's um you know think including methods like you know having inter eater and devices and things like that so it's you know there's also more methods of birth control that are available well\nSpeaking with marketwatch personal finance reporter Murray Hill ammonia she's written a piece of data more American women are having babies later and some are still conflicted about it as you mentioned a there was a question or a survey that looked at\nKind of the best way to get ahead and ... ... your professional life having babies earlier or later\nRight exactly and um there's you know obviously it's a very controversial topic and um you know you can't always control death and you know every woman's experience is very different but um yeah there have been sort of mixed results on um you know if people said you know quote unquote shed have children earlier or later in their career\nOn you know there was one survey that said thirty seven percent of women inside a woman who want to be a top executive should actually have children earlier\nAbout the same amount forty one percent said waiting it's better\nUm and so there's kind of see no two schools of thought I'm not either battery children earlier when you yourself earlier in your career and then um you know when they're a little bit older you can really you know clean and speak and and really extend your career or you know some people feel that waiting a little bit longer than having your baby when\nYou're a little more established it's better um but it also so much depends on\nYou know what you're competing maternity policy is and all those kinds of things so um you know it's obviously a

Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last person to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do it again it has not happened since Nineteen Ninety two [noise]\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite the manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been a kind of a difference in many respects to the president and this is another example he's saying things about the fatty blaming them for the market fell off he's saying that they've gotten crazy [noise]\nUm he said that they were his biggest threat to them and that's not something that we're really used to sing [noise] right\nRight so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[noise] that's what he said I'm a ... part of this has also laying the groundwork to blame the fad ah if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets\nAnd you know even though there's some speculation there about why he's doing this [laughter] if you look at ... the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people sit on the board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of dead presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA boat every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's doing is just to kind of a\nRunning public criticism of the central bank and you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the fed says presidents for criticism isn't going to change how they operate [noise] it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president's was probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else a as per usual when the president does something like this he started the discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n[noise] for exactly right people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is doing but President Trump is probably elevating that debate and saying look unemployment rate slow\n[noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as as a black disappears on the economy because you don't want to have inflation but what ... what President Trump is saying here as well worth the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates [laughter] we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nWe're speaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter has beat the scope presidents Sistine criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be catering to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what you want\nThat's right the question isn't very difficult right now the most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates\nSo the decisions they have to make right now on particularly difficult but that may not be the case a year from now what city you're from now you have the unemployment rate continuing to fall but inflation is maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do\nAnd so the question is on a close call where you don't have as much conviction\nAbout the policy pass through the president's criticisms\nBut again in your head at all I Know some people who say look this is creating a political risk they may have to take more seriously appointment you I'm doing a far as the other side which says look if the market's bigger than the question of such credibility\nAnd even worse and so it might actually from their backs a little bit but the so far as saying we're going to ignore that we're we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and people criticize it you know then we'll deal with that next", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Nashville", "day": "22"}
