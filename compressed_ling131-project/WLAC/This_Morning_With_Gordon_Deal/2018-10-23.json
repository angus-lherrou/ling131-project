then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part I've got to ask I Believe he's doing a show from there the man's school reform matory\nYep we sure did\nAnd every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you\nSure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times\nA following ... but anyway uh my father died\nAnd three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before they liked you woke up my father was there\nHe came in her bedroom sit down on a bed mom stood up you have your history and said honey everything's going to be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and I was going\nTo share that with a sweet mhm\nSo these sometimes these stories are just emotional as well aren't they Brendan\nYeah yeah yeah I like I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it in in my in the real and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye\nSaying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it it could have some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says there's sometimes paranormal experiences art uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life go to Joe in the Bronx side Joseph going he George how are you know Joe\nGood ah Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up are rich and and I have seen um [noise]\nYou know the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal under channel of communication going on between the go see a permission\nAnd the recipient of that goes to experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously is to subliminal um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience a half the my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having runners block on his song and I've really destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day\nOr at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall now um can you may be elaborate on what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or who he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away\nA ... a ... before he had the extra and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nAll right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question one quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the well we talked about earlier you know without the husband saying his wife and then the wife kind of says hey check fine of the workbench and he finds the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment um possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is is happening in other ways\nShe's saying get on with your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that hum unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog in the water injured and\nYou can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow I feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and kind of reading each other's emotions and then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere did we get the book to do studies sprinted a study that available at Barnes and noble

president during off year elections with a look at three build whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side jury set this up\nWell ... either for Democrats to win control the Senate and the Republicans have only\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's a lot of big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep those seats\nAnd turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there and find a couple of others that they can turn their way\nAnd when you look at it that a bit cohesion that they have to put together [laughter]\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether state will tell you whether they can pull this off or not and it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on a state that is going to increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd were she really did have a problem in how to handle the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there is a liberal base of progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin all want her to oppose it which she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds\nOn it'll be because she's Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the balance to be hugely important for the Democrats second one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat and other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights\nVery very uh a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden is again Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen is leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him as people think the rescue effort hasn't been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need to hold onto that when if they're going to have a chance they answered is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring Arizona as kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way uh in any election\nUh and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the\nDemocratic side in a year of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnchors the cinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if Democrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote\nTotal one of those probably going to have for years on them so that seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ...\nAn online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving\nDebatable topics like Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\n... that's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and\nI think in a certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a", "show_name": "This
