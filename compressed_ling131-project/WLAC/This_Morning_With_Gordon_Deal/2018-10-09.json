court but it also presents a considerable challenge for chief justice tasked with steering through national political turbulence that threatens to chip away at the courts legitimacy it's a story by Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall Brent what's up here\nJohn Roberts is the man in the middle of the Supreme Court both a literally and figuratively so you know he he leads to ... the face of the federal judiciary and now after Justice Kennedy retired the way the ideological\nBreakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so we are here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court could do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and\nYou know the whole process just is not to sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for the chief will be to to try to steer the court through these ... mean are pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another part of somebody you know\nHow do you steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him dear it\n[laughter] well I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not the sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court's role little bit there have been other times and on\nOn issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that to you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court\nAnd there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have a choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary ... meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear\nThe you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting for speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle chest Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now ... all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nFor most of them when they go through the confirmation process they have some visibility for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat\nAs Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable member of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did\nThe Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to the judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time any any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so\nYou know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kavanaugh\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate in the end to forge common ground with you know with a cross section of people in the court didn't than maybe slowly\nThat that sort of makes things a little better for him\nWhich Brent that's Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall
