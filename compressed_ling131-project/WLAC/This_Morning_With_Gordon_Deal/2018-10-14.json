someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said he had to tell his his small team that there really is just no police for political bakery network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who pays your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they respond I'd want to see how their employees feel\nBefore they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or want it to talk about politics and then

we heard on on all sides of this there were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nAh did not feel that are just I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic

[noise]\nTotal access to the world you're listening to America's first this weekend\nBig thing with the story of be fatal\nLimo crash that killed twenty people in upstate New York last weekend just seeing the headline breaks your heart but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr Judas or law\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly empathic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas are trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAccidents and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they\nGo to bed they become exhausted or anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize that you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's finance and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons in the brain where I'm at a path to that's why it's such a an interest in Cairo trust and an impact and thought that it mirror neurons that compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle your mirror neurons get activated but much more so and highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know is going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse had to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I'd suggest all night impact patients has to take notice fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught of stress and negative news it's just too much for anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature\nUm meditate exercise ... a friend and laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice it past traumas um\nTrigger it for instance you know if you lost your father\nAnd you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different now that could make a big difference to know that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current situation um and also do a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news\nNow be able to meditate go outside um learn now is a complete sentence with people because then passed don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no\nYou know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever you have the types of energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make all of this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be around\nEnergy vampires I write about her just drained your energy\nWe're speaking with Dr Judith ... she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific stretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed\nUm can the impasse who take on all\nA week and by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets and NYPD I'm snow globe you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws govern what can be sold are there any laws that say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands um [noise]\nWere first coming up ... and these are just the sidewalk new standards that are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands 'em a fan's veterans city property you could only sell news and\nUm it was even that it was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties the said he agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies that a great them to let themselves like pre packaged food and\nItems that cost less than five dollars and now they can fill just about anything\nKind of food and beverage wise as long as that's packaged and any kind of like ... a lot of it's under ten dollars they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because I think they want to keep the newscasts from competing with for front retailers for good reason um\nAnd then the city does have a law that if you're a newsstand you have to sell no and they actually said he told me they send out people to force that last but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or a lot a lot of space too I'm selling the newspapers the coastal margins are super low and they don't sound very much I'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and and so it and things that have a lot you know much higher margins\nAre sticking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stores I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the new stance or selling\nIt you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back a liar and a long time before like you know ... came and so I think even though\nUsually the the retailers all his fight it tooth and nail and then he just stands come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia in the city and a lot of action so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the newsstands officer to um [noise]\nService kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um rents out the sides and backs of the status for for um\nSelling advertising for the city wants to make sure that the newsstands can keep going it has an interest in making sure that they all start folding they want to keep us alive to keep that ad revenue coming in\nFor this weekend's

brought the smash success of a star is born the movie directed by Bradley Cooper\nA remake of the classic tale but in many ways\nThe film defied conventional wisdom in some cases going against that wisdom actively seem to help the film flourish in others to simply didn't hurt the way one might have expected steep psychic at the Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment says either way rival producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nWell I mean this is the case of you know a movie in a war in which you know in retrospect seems like about brain of a big hit of course Bradley Cooper directing it directly himself as well as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffalo business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd we'll probably a lot of success with the ... and he offers and and the road shows\nYeah on the line but you're saying about the film and and about the project is that ah there's really not a lot of ... with English would work I mean for one from the studios don't really make you got to the movies any more movies for grown ups movies that are in about\nFranchising superheroes I'm from the other was a movie that's been made three times before admittedly last time back in the seventies but with a lot of success before\nYou rule is you don't but we make a movie with fitting when Donald Dell a in the past because it's just going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version and again they bumped up a little too so the theory of oh sort of conventions liberate the side and um you know and it ... to ...\nYou know that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not really making a movie that's already done well in debt that high bar right do you think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's the thing that was the last or in the last few clips here years maybe more than a decade now that at all it was just got on the remake band when we're seeing about course on television as well is that you know and I feel this way all of us have a lot of people do you think that has come back but if if you bring them back to class\nOr if things don't look like when we feel like maybe a for the beach and been kind of a ... we're getting sort of a lesser versions of those earlier I can manage just does one had is that offer for one thing you know again it was back in the mid seventies so a lot of people even if they\nAre seeing a movie with Barbara Streisand on Christmas of course obviously in\nA you know it was a long time ago and I also think the world is changing the music world that are this document is very much about a sort of a Mario Cooper's characters is with our country rocker but when I was going to the modern a sort of pop superstar or on the way to becoming that\nThat's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances in the seventies show you know what it is to simply make it was a remake I think\nI had a lot to say about it and was informed to a great extent by what's happening right now\nWe're speaking with Stephen ... at the Washington Post ... the business of entertainment he's got a piece\nTitled the seven ways a star is born bucked Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway or we were talking off air I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of ... near when I saw the opening weekend box number of of uh like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to\nEntertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oh well let's put that number perspective because that's not really\nYou know they weren't after like a two hundred million dollar opening weekend\nThat's exactly right I you know I think the numbers are always funny when we get get gotta get inundated every weekend now well on Monday rather with these box office numbers one weekend right at the highest title and that's not really that was sort of\nA state of who should be like anything else or any other financial benchmark\nWe kind of have to make sure you know a very new to if you made you know a hundred grand in the stock market or if you're shares I worth that much but but we spend on your fifty thousand or to buy that that's probably not as if you made ten grand of course and I had always been a thousand that's a pretty good retirement and similar scenario I mean it's the mid ...\nA movie aimed at grown ups are not meant to be this kind of global assault on the box office the\nWow and this is ... and then you had already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience to just be clear or are spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as science hasn't told us that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over\nOr their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you mapped the use when you are when people are going to these travels these experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute in isolation that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered state\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of factors one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise matter of fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to remind me\nOf a mind mirror is just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that that that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up\nTo our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and the Web site by the way as astral info ... dot org\nAnd there are great resources on their of um [noise] I I I've found specifically ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in the Senate you want to go through to do that there are\nLots of great things were going to be talking about and a second with some of your survey results the um\nBased on your sixteen thousand one hundred and eighty five responses you ... a leading came out with the um common and reported phenomena associated with out of body experience is very interesting so the\nAverage of what people go through which is fantastic in on this is free on the site which is I I think great that you really help and give the information freely so people can practice especially if you have something going on in your life a problem or an illness\nYou can connect to your own answers can you connect with people that their loved ones that um can you help them with the answer\n[noise] well you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether each individual was open to whatever information you want to share but\nWe have the ability to contact\nOur loved ones face to face\nYeah amazing experience that is incredible and and we don't need a medium to do it that every medium we'll give you a second hand information filtered through their own mind

that the mirror neurons to compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle your mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nA week and by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets and NYPD I'm snow globe you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws govern what can be sold are there any laws that say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands um [noise]\nWere first coming up ... and these are just the sidewalk new standards that are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands 'em a fan's veterans city property you could only sell news and\nUm it was even that it was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties the said he agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies that a great them to let them sort of like pre packaged food and\nItems that costs less than five dollars and now the console just about anything\nKind of food and beverage wise as long as that's packaged and any kind of like ... and a lot of his under ten dollars they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because I think they want to keep them in his hands from competing with for front retailers for good reason [noise] um\nThen the city does have a law that if you're a newsstand you have to sell no and they actually said he told me they send out people to force that last but it's a very vague law just as they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or well a lot of space too I'm selling the newspapers because the margins are super low and they don't sound very much I'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and and so it and things that have a lot you know much higher margins\nAre speaking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stories I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the new stance or selling\nIt you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back ... a long time before like you know ... came and so I think even though\nUsually the the retailers olive fight tooth and nail and then in his fans come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia in the city and a lot of action so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the newsstands officer to um [noise]\nIt was kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um rents out the sides and backs of these status for for um\nSelling advertising for the city wants to make sure that the newsstands can keep going has an interest in making sure that they don't start folding they want to keep us alive to keep that ad revenue coming in\nFor this weekend's Jennifer ... with Wall Street journal columnist into debt operators by the way the stance or

D movies do I look in the piece of the greatest showing the musical although it quite well last year and we started out with eight million and and that's another factor here Gordon\nIt was almost feel the same way you could have a let's say a five sixty score\nA hundred percent financing no money in the bank a high debt to income ratio but you still got alone ... and now today if you're trying to go through that exact same process and even though your score might be a hundred points higher\nYou're sitting here going man I'd have to provide this much information\nWhen I bought my last house and\nWhen when I say that much information we're talking last year's tax returns to pay stubs recent pay stubs a W. twos if you have ... not war from the IRS too recent bank statements all pages shown okay if you're gonna put\nMoney down you can't seem to know if there's if it says page four or five and you don't spend five even though fads blank there I don't want to say ... ... ... and everybody that I didn't have nothing on it but the number five it doesn't matter they want to say that five of them like that does every does\nEverybody bank with your bank\nNow so I don't know that I don't know that that ... that happens every time they are like water that ...\nYeah I mean and once you get a fruit for alone you don't want to do anything they'll go out and buy stuff don't don't try to get money from other sources I'll buy furniture\nForever out right at it closed on\nYet I learned the hard way 'cause I'm a down payment down I ... and I had some regional funds that are just you know we get money from and and the mutual fund or take it along enough all through it so you know I think that about five grand to give me the closing of so called my mom was like hey you've only ran for a couple of days he was like yeah sure and I told her when I was doing\nAnd uh some part of the mortgage lender he's like yeah no no we can't do that I'm like why not [noise]\nI got to know where it's coming from his letter from your mother or something because like I was going to be from ... set a couple of days he pushed back closing for a week and I got my money and we did it but I'm like I didn't have any idea that would be an issue\nRight yeah it's we we have an obligation to fulfill the Lenny laws in the linen laws clearly state we have to\nProve where every penny is coming to you how where every penny is coming from that it's coming to closing and that's because of money laundering issues um yeah 'cause I can be mattress money how I mean and it may be legit money ... I mean you might be money that you're like\nIn case the banks closer there's a power outage I Can't get to an ATM I mean you may have whatever amount of money you've got at home or you may have it on a locked box as even though a lock box is that the bank\nThere's no accounting of it there's no record of it so where did it really come from\nDo they do we know that you didn't go take out some alone with some loan shark or something like that and now you've got this high payment yeah that's true I mean it it all comes back to we learned our lessons from the financial collapse and all that stuff\nIn the years prior and a lot of the rule changes we see or we have seen are to prevent that from happening again yeah you know it's it's like your credit score a lot of people do ask me questions why my credit score constantly going up and down first question how many credit cards Jeff\nHow much should we put on your credit cards versus before because your credit score will automatically adjust based on your balances at our increase it on your credit cards once you go over twenty percent twenty percent of your balance a ... year if you want you to bounce goes exceeds twenty percent of your credit limit\nIt starts to ... your credit score and that way you can't get yourself and too much trouble and go out to open up all this new debt\nAnd then before you know it and all of a sudden thirty forty five days later here's all these statements coming in and you're like holy crap I've got to pay out five hundred bucks more month right now but you didn't realize it before from right now\nSo the rules are tightening or had been tightened to protect you protect us as lenders and protect industry um another big one is\nNo job changes I mean people that change change jobs even if you're going from let's say you\nAre [noise] um [noise] whatever ... years some sort of professional and you're going from a W to job and you're saying you know what I'm gonna start my own company and now you're doing the exact same work you're truly making\nMore money but now you're self employed and you're not W tuned yourself which a lot of people do oh yeah sure in the world that the deal killer I mean it's it's dead on arrival you don't even get started\nIf you're gonna make the job change do it the day after closing absolutely [laughter]\nAre you guys another reason to call the lender here again I buy a house yeah oh my God\nJust drive me insane people yeah the idea I I went to lifting apartment I mean like a month ago went to the house walked through it at the numbers look great let's do it\nI'm like have you talked to the lender about where you're going about what you're buying about your pre approval you need to make sure I Will we did you know of months ago none and now let's do it again yeah I guess what he just change jobs now going to happen out on his on\nIt I mean as you know you need to I mean and I get the ... that people don't know these things because you wouldn't know that unless you're in our industry you probably did really wouldn't know that now but that's why you need to know all these things before he started jumping in instead of a ...\nAnd and the key thing about changing jobs especially going from a W two jobs to self employed is on your W to actually pay stubs\nYou could project out what your income is I mean we can go back and get an average wing average it out as many years we want or may must we want we can look at your overtime you'll get your bonus stuff and we can project out okay here's what your income is in a very comfortable simplistic calculation\nWhen you go self employed\nTechnically you only have a pay one pace of the year and that's your tax returns\nBecause on your tax returns you're showing all your income all your expenses and as a self employed individual you have the ability to write off a lot of your income to reduce your tax liability so you oh hardly anything or you get a tax refund back at the end of the year\nWhere the W. person they've got a ... foot all their numbers into the box into the equation and it's but it's a boom just what you get and self employed you can pay zero taxes zero dollars in taxes 'cause you show zero dollars in income\nSo what happens when you you uh change jobs like say two month for rent or buy a house that you have to there's there are certain amount of history you need before you're going to give 'em alone ...\nIf you're W do and you're going you know same same ministry you just took a better job ... or even a similar job in your pays the same as long as it's W. too it's no big deal and I want to pay a\nLittle I have to wait like six months or something no\nNo not unless there's something unique going on there are situations times where that might become a a a problem but I mean the big issues when you're going to be to to self employed because now you got no way of ... approve what your income is until you file your taxes identity here\nAnd I can't tell you how many times I've seen pianos profit last statements that show exactly how much is being distributed in every bucket and so forth but then you come back and you see that tax return for the following year or for that\nLater and you're like you know you know when we did this loan back you know last year for you and all this stuff was shown over here and you're showing making Fifteen twenty grand a month\nBut then your tax return shows you making five grand a month ...\nPlace for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time\nSo of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was a a PR group in a New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called the Bateman group and they have offices in New York and San Francisco and what the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I found interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker him they'd had had to set up for the past year\nThe flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers there to really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it you know about\nThat well we're speaking with you cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the workplace I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be worse than having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\n[noise] that's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said that he had to tell his his small team but there really is just no please for political bickering network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they respond I'd want to see how their employees feel\nBefore they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or want it to talk about politics and then we go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues it but I think but we we heard on on all sides of this that they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that a cat and I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across the guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out of work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal reporter ship cutter it's

success of a star is born the movie directed by Bradley Cooper a remake of the classic tale but in many ways\nThe film defied conventional wisdom in some cases going against that wisdom actively seemed to help the film flourish in others it's simply didn't hurt the way one might have expected steam psychic at the Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment says either way rival producers should be paying attention Steve how to use the it\nWas the case of you know a movie star war which shot you know in retrospect seemed like a no brainer big hit of course Bradley Cooper directing it directly himself as well as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffalo business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd probably a lot of success of the ... and the doctors and and the road shows\nYeah on the line but only about ... about the project is that uh there's really not a lot of reading with English would work I mean for one from ... to the movies in the war movies for grown ups movies that are in about\nFranchising superheroes um for another was a movie that's been made three times before admittedly last time back in the seventies but with a lot of success before\nYou lose your belt that we make a movie with getting will do well in the past because it was just going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version I again they bumped out a little too so the theory of sort of convention liberate the side and um you know and it ...\nYou know that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not really making a movie that's already done well in debt that high bar right you do you think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's another thing that was the last ... years maybe more than a decade now that at all it was just ... of course on television as well is that you know and I feel this way all of us have a lot of people do seem to think that would come back but if if you're bringing back to class\nOr if you don't look like ... like maybe a beach been kind of a ... sort of ... versions of those earlier boots I mainly just always one had is that offer for one thing you know again it was back in the mid seventies so a lot of people even if they\nAre seeing a movie will with Barbara Streisand been Christmas of course obviously in\nA you know it was a long time ago and it was the world is changing the music world that uh misspelling documents he's very much about a sort of a Mario Cooper's characters with our country rock are ready to go to the bottom of a sort of pop superstar or all the way to becoming that\nThat's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances in the seventies show you know just a simple remake it was a remake I think\nA lot to say about it and was informed through a great extent by what's happening right now\nWe're speaking with Stephen ... at the Washington Post covers the business of entertainment he's got a piece\nTitled the seven ways a star is born bucks Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway uh we were talking I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of ... near when I saw the voting weekend box number of of uh like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to\nEntertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oh well but what that number perspective 'cause that's not really\nYou know they weren't after like a two hundred million dollar opening weekend\nThat's exactly right I you know I think these numbers are always funny where we get we get kind of get inundated every weekend now we're on Monday rather were these box office number one the weekend but at the eyes total and that's not really but sort of\nA state of who should be like anything else or any other financial benchmark\nWe kind of have to make sure you know\nComparing it to if you made you know a hundred grand in the stock market uh if you share that with a much bigger than a hundred and fifty thousand or to buy them that's probably not so good whereas if you made ten grand of course and I'd always been a thousand that's a pretty good return similar scenario I mean there's a limited budget\nMovie aimed at grown ups are not meant to be this kind of global assault on the box office the a ... might be for you after so ah you know the fact that he made forty two point six million when you look at\nYou know how how ... movies do I look in the beach at the greatest showman which is a musical already quite well last year and we started out with eight million and and that's another factor here Gordon\nWe tend to have when we're moving industry calls leg related to say\nYou know you have a the Avengers or you have a big superhero movie I can kind of coming up pretty quickly started more than it opens in October\nThere were two months out were meant to months out from Christmas still could play every weekend do if he does anything approaching even a fraction of
