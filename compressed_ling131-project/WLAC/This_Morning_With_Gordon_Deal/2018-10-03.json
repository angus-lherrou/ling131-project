accountability\nStudies annual political spending policies that s it'd be five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers are either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tail what are we seeing here\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that a lot more freedom\nTo swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always paid lobbied I've always found a lot of money in Washington and in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is\nWhat this shows though is that something big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWell so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates in other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support a candidate such AS Party a democratic Republican uh governor's a tax cut that basically support a direct getting\nGovernors one party or the other or a similar groups for attorney general and state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little Richard of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money I'm going to wars area\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produced this report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at that you know they're tracking these companies year after year supported and fortunately companies\nHave been in the ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a cow and where and when they spend\n... and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and they also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example they used it published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their reports are much uh informative than they used to be a fewer companies now in part because of new companies joining they asked me five hundred index fewer companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah ah to display their political spending reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies\nStay in the index it turns out that larger companies and companies that have been in the index longer tend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies you referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was the mayor did they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a less for coming in me in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what the restrictions are on a on the political spending in talking to me they said their position hasn't changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns are candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like Fargo NDSU fours and twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language that Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or\nAnd they tell their trade associations not to use ... for a election activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nWas gonna say so is that does some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization that Center for political\nAn ability but then also uh some\nShow us or shoulder applicants have put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to uh you know I asked her older tape much told the company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances can be either she and how those votes go overtime\nOr just on their own initiative
