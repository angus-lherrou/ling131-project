where it's all about teaching you to keep on call Sam sticky hands out of your back pocket [noise]\nTalk radio Fifteen ten W LA see this is the tendency tax busters and we are granted retirement and tax advisory I'm your host and my name is Andrew good morning thank you for tuning in if you're returning welcome back we always appreciate our returning listeners and it's this is your first\nTime to the show we welcome you uh we've got a good show today we're gonna be talking about some good information for the tax world the retirement world and how they work together but uh I have a couple of people here with me today who's over there across the\nTable to morning ... in the morning cliff how're you doing peachy keen good so yeah we've got some good stuff to talk about today All right how you doing in their Jimmy I'm good I'm more awake and cliff is a threat yeah well I got a little bit was caffeine or me [laughter] there you go hang out of\nAll right Jim me well you make sure we sound good to dare I served in Iraq well hey before we jump in and start talking about the uh interesting information we want to bring a the Saturday morning\nI always like to talk a little bit about us and who we are where we come from so granted retirement in tax advisory as a retirement planning financial advisory firm here in the greater Nashville area we have offices and Dixon Bellevue Henderson deal in ... springs and we've been serving the greater Nashville area for the last twenty six years\nAnd our philosophy is that taxes and investments go hand in hand that if you don't work with somebody who knows both sides of the equation\nYou're going to be missing out and you're not going to be able to optimize what could be a possibly a better retirement or a better portfolio or a less expensive tax situation because it's\nNot always about how much you make it sound much keep right\nHow much I get to keep in my pocket at the end of the day is what's most important to me why people\nAlways it always amazes me being in this industry people always want to brag about return well how much of that returned to keep us right so how you know people talk about this one of us and what they made and oh it made so much great money well how much of that did you keep her home was did you hang on to the best of the two law\nThat's right we're going to talk about that a little bit later a lot of people don't know the the big downfall that are sitting out there and their IRAs and therefore all one case we're going to talk about that we're going to tell you how to take control of those situations so that you are in control and I'm not Uncle Sam\n... little teaser there or you probably don't have as much money into retirement account as you think that's right and nobody really does I Know we're going to get to that All right so ah\nAgain twenty five twenty six years here in the greater Nashville area are from is built up a couple of different experts so when we realized was is that the the traditional way of retirement planning or later life planning was that you would have a tax professional that helped you file your taxes hopefully helps you\nActively manage your taxes because tax preparation and tax management are very different thing two totally different thing and then they would all we also have a financial advisor or a portfolio manager that would help them with their retirement assets and then finally an estate planning attorney that would help them with wills trusts powers of attorney\nAnd what most people have in common is that they have three different entities that help them with these very important issues in their lives\nAnd who talks to each of those people and has to really all the information and then go back and get a clarification on this question or that quite who has to do that\nWell the client has to do all the work there you go [noise] so what we did is we tried to pull those three pieces together and put them under one roof so that our clients can come and ask questions and we can get answers the day of or know who to bring in to our next appointment so that we can answer those questions so\nIf you're looking for somebody to either give you a second opinion on your car per Foley oh if you're looking for somebody to help you look over your tax situation from previous years and make sure that you're not paying a dime more than you're supposed to end taxes or if you're looking for somebody who can help you structure\nYour state so that it transfers and the most advantageous wait for your family or the the charities that you appreciate give us a call six twenty five for for one twelve Seventy four\nAnd a let us know we'd be happy to meet you in any of our for office locations again it's Dixon Bellevue Henderson bill\nAnd a cool spring so uh we'd be happy to meet we never charge a dime for our time so if you come and you meet with us and we talk and we have some questions we can answer for you that would be great and if we worked together down the road that would be terrific um but you will not pay ascent to come and meet with us in fact we might make you a cup of coffee there you\nGo and that's important to say because the industry financial services industry has special and even some of the tax planning industry is just getting more and more gotten more and more to the point of you charge people for your time kind of like a lawyer would in the sense of you know you can sit down for an hour and it's going to cost as much\nAnd then you've got the kind of the old school kind that everybody's just built off how much commission can I make how much can I make doing this or doing that\nAnd and uh we want people to understand that we are willing to sit down and talk with you to look at your situation to give you a feedback I'm\nReally without charge new because what we don't want is that to be the barrier for ... for ... from you getting the answers that you have for the questions that you have yeah\nAnd I like the the we seminar recently were one of the ladies in the roof said yeah but how much is the second meeting we clarify it it's not that it's not that we're getting un break free meeting and there were going to start charging you we're gonna we're gonna make money if we work together\nWith you but if if you choose to we're not right for you or we kind of say you know we don't think you're a good match\nFor what we do we're just going to be honest about that because there's always somebody else to talk to\nYeah and the truth is is that we we want to surround ourselves with the kind of clientele that we know we can make happy and there's very very uh\nYou know a certain kind of person in certain kinds of goals that they're trying to create that we specialize in and those would be minimizing taxes creating tax free income for retirement tax free legacies or for your your ah beneficiaries fur and hair tense\nUm and then also portfolio management and income creation for retirement with a special tea and making sure that you're not paying more in taxes and you're supposed to and that's going to be very important whoever you work with out there if you're new to town 'cause I Know over a hundred people are moving here today\nSo if you're ... new to town and you're looking for a support system or a group of experts that can help you with these types of financial\nSituations feel free again give us a call six one five for for one twelve Seventy four\nYou can also find as clear retirement dot com if you like to use the Internet if you like\nTo use that Internet strategy and that is right so uh we're going to be back here and just a few minutes but uh when we come back so stay tuned because we are going to be talking about the downfall of your ... and your IRA something that a lot of people\nDon't think about I'm just sitting out there and waiting to take advantage of you if you don't take advantage of it first so we're gonna talk about that [noise] um and a couple of other things so please stay tuned we'll be right back this is talk radio Fifteen ten W LA see this is the Tennessee tax busters and we are granted retirement intact advisory [noise]\nTalk radio in the ... the this is the tendency tax busters and we are granted retirement and tax advisory welcome back to the show thanks for staying to through the commercial break we got some interesting information coming up for you but before we dive into it before we start talking about the downfall\nAnd your IRAs and your four oh one case that most people are not thinking about a clip also brought up an interesting point over the break is that there is also somebody out there keeping a very close eye on your IRAs and four one K. is that most people are not aware of and we're going to talk about that\nAnd we're also going to talk about solutions to have more control over your IRAs and for a one case then you may or may not be aware that you have now but um\nBoard and stuff [laughter] sounds like an boards that it is only important stuff on this Saturday morning but I guess some caffeine Jimmy ... feel better right or you do\nHe he will get a better job will per year lego like the coffee\nFor cliff and I were talking over the break we were talking about the types of people that we see on a daily basis and that it's interesting because a lot of times that the individuals who do come and meet with us or our tax professionals are our state planners\nI'm here at granted retirement and tax advisory they show up at an educational event uh-huh ah you know they typically fall into a couple of different category to you know we we do we see a lot of people still that\nUm have done exactly what they've learned to do growing up and they've put a little bit of their paycheck every single paycheck a little bit goes in there for all and K ah or there for three be depending on where they work and um they just let that money grow during their career and then they get closer to retirement and then all of a sudden it dawns on them\nOh wait a second now I've got to take this nest egg that I saved and I somehow have to make it last at least as long as I Do\nIs yours and you don't know how much of it is Michael Sam's and you won't know until it's time to start taking it out so cliff\nOf I asked you right now if you wanted an open an account with me but that I got to choose how much of it was mine year to year would you do that let me think about it and after the break I'll give you my answer a blank check that I just made me a blank jak we'll be right back at least they do and we've got more than a great information coming up it's the talk radio Fifteen ten W. L. A. the\nWe're the Tennessee tax busters brought to you by granted retirement and tax advisory\n[noise]\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower were spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family [noise]\nRadio Fifteen ... feet into the Tennessee tax busters and we are granted retirement and ... welcome back to the shows they things for a stay in tune\nBefore we left for the break we were talking about\nI raised ... and a big sneaky underhanded downfall and maybe not underhanded for us to be a question I suppose I made but I got to set that I got all that the ... for everybody just in case they are just joining us so we're\nTalking about IRAs and ... and how a IRA we've been widely told that stands for an individual retirement account but if you look up the publication five Ninety on the IRS website you will find that Uncle Sam calls it an individual retirement arrangement\nAnd the reason behind that is because your IRA your four one K. your tax deferred retirement accounts are joined account with Uncle Sam so\nEvery time Congress starts talking about taxes you need to look at your TV and say I have an arrangement with those guys right\nYou do and and the scary thing is the the uh\nThe downfall that we see is that who gets to change\nTheir ratios of how much money in that four one K. your IRA is yours and how much is the government's when the government death right and so when push comes to shove and the IRS and the and our government says you know what we can no longer pay our national debt bill\nWith the tax revenue that's being created we have to raise taxes what does that mean for your tax deferred accounts that means that Uncle Sam is going to come in and say All right\nMore of your account as mine now when you take this withdraw I'm going to keep more of it because I'm going to raise taxes or I'm going to do away with deductions or I'm going to get rid of exemptions and we're going to talk a little bit about that cliff came up with a a a really interesting concept that I Want to get to about a\nFew didn't ask me and my question now they don't worry don't worry we're going to just stay tuned we're going to talk about uh the government taking benefits away\nOr what they really do to kind of scared that issue because they don't they don't scoop in LA I'm taking a hundred thousand dollars a year IRA as right they don't do that well anyway cliff I Know you want to answer this question so I asked cliff before we left after the break if if we could open a joined account together and investment account together\nAnd if I could change the rules year to year\nOn how much of that account was mine and how much with his than if you would do that or not what the answer\nAs much as I respected Meyer and care about you thought about this deeply in the answer is no\nI'm Glad you put some thought into it I really tell you wait the opposite there you go well I've had a little caffeine now this morning and my brain is thinking clearly you know but that sounds ridiculous right that sounds ridiculous to somebody sat across the table for me and said hey let's open an account together but I get to change how much of that account as mine than yours your ear and nobody would do that\nBut that's what our ... and our IRAs and our tax deferred accounts are exactly right\nBut there's a way around it and there's a way to protect yourself from it\nAnd there's a way to put yourself in control instead of letting Uncle Sam have all the control but it will not happen on its own and you need to work with a a team like ours if not ours like are somebody who has the tax professionals the financial professionals and the legal profession\nOr this or yes there is a legacy issue definitely yes I Am\nAbsolutely all under one roof so that you know you're getting the best information from all the sources on the spot and that these individuals are working together for your benefit\nBecause how many times have we have people come in who say well I was told X Y and Z a non back to X Y and Z but I was in all this this is so about my retirement account and so I I took these actions and we're like\nThat hurt you yeah and there's no way that you can undo it yeah war there's a way that you know do it but it's gonna be hard yeah\nSo you don't want that to be your case so when you're making these big decisions make sure that you're getting a second opinion talk to multiple groups find out who you click with and who makes you feel at ease and who you think is going to bring the best information for your scenario to you and I've heard us\n... are you comfortable enough with your president plan are you comfortable enough with your president advisor to get a second opinion there and if you are in great let's talk and if you're not then that ...\nAbsolutely so when you're thinking about those I raised us for one k.'s and that taking tax time bomb that's just sitting out there\nAnd and how Uncle Sam may or may not be able to affect your future retirement if you want to if you want to get more information on that we're the people to talk to the number six one five for for one twelve Seventy four again we have offices in Dixon Bellevue Henderson bill and cold springs and we'd be happy to meet you had any of them I'm On this\nOn line and clear retirement dot com or being so there's a lot of ways to reach out to yeah absolutely you can even see Andrews handsome face and my bearded face on line there you have to grow that beard back out and it's kind of coming in a little bit\nBut yeah so one thing we haven't really talked about I Know you're kind of leading up something but I feel like this is this is an appropriate place to maybe bring up but I'll let you decide\nUm so when we talk about how they can change the rules on ...\nAnd that so that affects this idea that we had when we start got started getting into these programs of a well maybe we've got to make different plants instead of just letting them set for the next ten years Twenty years Thirty years right\nWhen all these things were put into place Social Security benefits were not taxable right\nAnd then in the early eighties they became taxable at a lower level than they are today and then in the early nineties the Clinton Administration up that even higher so eighty five percent of your Social Security income\nIs subject to taxes if you make more than a certain amount of money right that's right right and and the numbers that were decided on how much you can make I think they're like forty four for couples dirty for singles I'm not sure but somewhere right around there I'm not one of the tax guys but they are right around there so usually\nThose numbers kind of go up well you know I Am more expensive you know there's a ... cost of living and so we up those numbers how much you can you can make before you start getting taxed\nHave those numbers changed at all since the early nineties now no so the income that you were allowed to make in Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd not get taxed on your Social Security benefits to same dollar amounts same dollar amount today is that thirty three thousand thirty two thousand dollars is that still it does not have the same buying power nope no it's not worth the same I mean so when you're going to let you to fill a tank of gas or [laughter] you got a big court\nBut er but still I mean and you get to that number quicker because ... how much you're going to make is probably higher than it was a Nineteen Ninety two yeah or Ninety three or whatever and\nAnd so here's here's an interesting idea that they close kind of bringing up and leading us into um so what what's the issue if if Social Security gets tax a little bit why is that a problem that I made a X amount of dollars which is great for me so why does it matter my Social Security get tax a little bit\nYeah well go ahead you're telling me this though\nSo it's interesting there was a study done I'm comparing individuals who could keep their Social Security from being taxed by using active tax management which is something that we specialize and\nCompared to individuals who had no active tax management or tax planning and who just allowed themselves to get taxed at the rate that they would naturally get tax that if they didn't do anything\nIt helps 'cause we're thinking about the the witches and found that they're not just pressing a religion they're also you know\nThis is people their own shop there all along you know they all have some kind of stake in the economy of Salem\nWaiting for that [laughter] yeah so on and it's\nKind of like a little bit offensive but I'm On the other hand for brings people into your shop that's uh net win for them so it it's it's again rarely complicated to like a fascinating degree their whole economy there\nYeah it's a little bit like come in here get outta here come in here and what are you doing you know ... exactly that\nAfter they get the money anyway so then it did show you mentioned that that you know because of the dean Halloween town it it it has done it and because of the ... the sheet shift you're aspect of\nWitchcraft cause it was perceived back then that it's also a town where people spend a lot of time with you know we're will and goes and and I'm assuming some of the other universal monsters make an appearance in Salem\nYeah so that's another aspect so we talked about it being you know which city we talked about it being Halloween town\nThen I also part of that they're kind of kind of horror land right you go down the street of Salem you're going to see not just which is ... which costs and you're going to the Frankenstein monster and you're gonna see Harry Potter and Voldemort you're going to see you know the Addams family all these guys will be there either by forming your actual street performers or as visitors\nUm to the point that if you're a horror fan like horror movies than sailing you've got to kind of put that on your bucket list along with the no universal studios and some others in\nHollywood and other places you want to go to the um horror movie side so it's become a mecca for that as well so it has all these facets the kind of tired of them are dark I guess is the is the um common denominator but they're all different than their own way\nWe're talking with W Oscar season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts um and at the same time you left the pirates right 'cause there's a there's a connection for pride to tears in saying\nThose sales built on the maritime trade there were some of the first people in the ... well not the country at the time before leaving the country who sent who've mapped out the Asian roots of trade like the first ever millionaire was a failing because there were so good that trade overseas\nAnd of course that comes with pirates there's actually a pirate museum there and say on the line with the other stuff that you can kind of learn about you know they have similar stories to most of these coasts where all the kind of pirates head out here and there so they have a whole entire pirate chapter their history as well which again is another kind of weird layer the story of failing to have\nLike I said earlier like two dozen layers above\nJust being the site of a trial and back and fixing it to\nThe uh yeah and it it's not just a trial of course to right as soon as the series but still those trials it was so fascinating to\nTo talk about it earlier this year in in for people who have\nCaused inside her you know back and listen to the show it was ... I I think what was I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who are protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that is kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you were let go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right I Am ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their belief all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's Cristobal such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene there the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or to call a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which\nWill never go well I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now are starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down roads and becomes more even bigger popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a leg or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it actually around the only other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town and Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over on the people were like using the grave as you know picnic table\nAnd climbing on them and doing all kinds of\nBad stuff to an actual historical artifacts that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a part of you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start heading the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train and it takes some time so by midnight nobody around an aloe and\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ... hour\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] really bad that\nThey got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's in the real which happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list of\nThings that are integrated night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to Ross well in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween or sorry on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast am All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next on coast to coast am this is Ian\nOh all the accounts that reference happen shut down um but the\nThe the whole thing is though that when these account to shut down the new ones are made and new ones are made so what so there's definitely still what the researchers told us that those definitely count still being monitored that are that way then more recently a on various topics whether that was\nThe Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick that will also drew a lot of charged reactions or the U.S open final between ... and and I only have socket that also\nReally drew a lot of attention so it's clear that they see sports as a way into the conversation about American culture in a way to sort of discord\nSo they're obviously sowing discord of some kind of does that mean that the tweets are influential\nIt definitely varies I mean some of these\nCats didn't have many followers and probably didn't reach that many people on the other hand there were ... each is of a cat the cat grew to have\nA tens of thousands of followers and could have tens of

high right now that it allows us to stretch really far so that's part of the process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun we start to look at\nOur lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream and when we wonder and we think it I go by that took it why would I Do think that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance in a great way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however\nI Do you know during a walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nSure and so you think about turnout not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't ears and you have to go back to work that day what you want to do is say OK why can't I have\nX Y Z and you fill that blank can why can't I Dream about a bigger house is that something that's gonna blessed my family is that something that I'm going to have the ability to do more in my life with\nAnd so it's not about being able to put into that\nIt stretches and it hurts intention really different\nIs there's such a thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to or I don't know why\nShould I mean if we dream that did that then we don't follow it up with any yeah then I mean that creates a to go into things like anxiety or even to be depressed a little bit because we think we're never going to reach that so we solved again we self doubt we self sabotage\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was that and\nYou know it was interesting because that took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrive they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV they were stripped of their clothes and put in this stress base here\nAnd they were told that they were these criminals that had been bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking them through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and they ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this fog and this man is monster with a mask\nJust pops out of nowhere and starts rationing them around and rich the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear and is just nearing simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest than\nYeah so the majority of these protests are going to that end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was the ... about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking wow that they must be really shaken up and they are\nBut as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would give it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some rules of these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys\nWere kind of funny and he told me that his only rules were basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred than\nThat but you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having no touching rural and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some\nOf the participants they leave with bruises they leave with circus scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and\nYou know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being tortured but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves the story forward there are all about it\nThis

USA Today money reporter Twenty one minutes now in front of\nThe hour on this weekend [noise]\nAnd I can't believe that we're playing for for basketball with a barber shop with\nYou know most loans the average woman has kept forty two months correct that's it yeah so uh you can't even think about it in a five year term which actually surprises me that more people don't do it just for rights I Know they have a terrible name in our lives and the hits from the best things ... the I'm not saying that I'm just an surprise I don't see more of them any more\nMy little honey understand them and from back in the fall yeah that was kind of you know that was that the ...\nThe main object is one thing to put it back to you Chris okay\nWhy do you go pay for thirty year mortgage when you're not going to be in the house for Thirty years\nWhen you know you're thirty year rate is going to be higher than your adjustable rate and your adjustable we'll give you a ... year fixed rate a seven year a ten year just like a thirty year but it's at a lower rate so you're going to save money on an adjustable rate even though it's locked in for five years seven years ten years your payment will not go up\nAnd if you can save money over thirty year why wouldn't you\nWhile I'm a I'm a number Scotts all I Do I Know the numbers and make sense to me so most people I think\nBelieve that there are actually going to the mentality they're going to be in that house maybe for the rest of the most ... a lot of people do now they're buying houses when they commit the are committing for the longer they probably are terrified of the fact that hey I'm going to be here in his rights gonna just gonna go up but I'm never going to go to ... and then I'm going to be stuck\nBut the numbers just don't like most people are not going to be in that house for Thirty years ah they're either going to sell it they're going to move there gonna get relocated they are going to need to figure out how they're going to need a smaller house\nI think like the younger generations disease at the world or whatever and there's more they're they're more realistic about that a lot of and when you sell houses the younger people that like I'm not going to be here forever now I think that's more of the\nI don't I mean how do you have discussions with people about that kind of stuff yeah and and as of\nLate with the way the rates have been down into threes and fours\nThe the didn't make any sense no that was just to say that the the spread between a fixed rate versus an arm there just wasn't that big of a difference to make it to justify not going with the thirty year\nBut as rates are moving up you're going to start to see that spread between an arm and a thirty year fix become bigger and larger and it's going to become more attractive to wear All right you might be able to get an arm that's half a point that three quarters points lower\nThan what you ... and ... are on your arm adjustable rate mortgage do you give me that\nLong and I you know what else we're going to fail at rhyme every at least that at the same level marketing yes we talked about that just the other day yes we did because I'm about to lift south yes yeah but how many people actually do that I don't know but I think that's a great marketing till it is a great marketing to like you got out you know five and a half and this was a three point now you have you\nFirst of all you know anybody would actually know how to do that right now I don't know that and they you know in the VA market that actually happens\nAll the time in what we're very close to a very large military base in in in I don't do a lot of them but I Do know that happens a lot where PS two those loans because those veterans are constantly moving in and out and they literally just go find a house that's hardy active with alone and kind of take it over and go now the ...\nBut it is that the rates are good now the downfall is that people have to qualify whoever's buying it they have to qualify for the loans as raise do continue to climb I Do think we're going to see that [noise]\nUm I tell everybody ... I don't ever so we didn't move because I have a two and a half percent interest rate on my house that I got when the when the when the rates were super super low so I'm the guy contributing to the problem and in our economy other not selling houses\nBut I don't have an assumption feature on that but if I had a loan that had that who do you think would want to buy my house with a two and a half percent interest rate I mean it would be the more it would be workable deal so I Do think we're going to see that coming or is that something that if water stone did that and somebody says hey I Want assume I'm gonna buy Andrus house I'm going to assume her loan [noise]\nDo you ... do you do does the mortgage company facilitate that nowadays because back in the day would come through us but is that something that the mortgage company facilitates\nYou know honestly Andrew asked me this the other day and I said you know what\nI Know that there's some some clauses in the mortgage is but you know clients ever asked me about it yeah every ... or civil directed the government stuff is the conventional stuff nine and Ninety nine Ninety nine times out of a hundred year conventions are not going to be unless you have some sort of niche program that does happen assembly clause in it [noise]\nLike just like end and I talked about you still have to qualify and you you mentioned it as well you still have to qualify as just that\nYou know you've got to get a release of liability and if you don't know what that is what that means if Michael I bought your house and I assume you're alone and you didn't get a release a liability and I hope and I quit than you\nAre on the hook my friend or me and I don't know many I always tell people I'm like if you're actually going to ever consider doing this the first thing you need to figure out to do is can you get the release of liability death\nBecause if you can't get that it doesn't matter if there was there's no way I Would trust anybody to continue to make those payments would and then I have to be responsible\nFor it and that's going to come down more than likely going to come down in my opinion to each individual investor whoever's back in the loan and will they give it to you and then\nNow is that an investor or the service or standpoint or is that like a da or an F. A. J. who makes that decision\nBoth but I mean it's going to be normally your investors going to do it because I mean ultimately it's all going to follow through the Geneva ... coupon platform where all government loans are back but you've just got to get the ... if you don't have the release and it's like you said I'd love to know what the percentages are that those are handed out like as he she called and I was like ... you know who she called\nMe and I thought you said you shouldn't shot that you mentioned called somebody now I mean I Am in Fifteen Years and never had an affair had somebody on that we're gonna learn 'cause I'm going to try to when I Do I loved it I Would ever even edges of of of actually hand than those get out of jail free card on that stuff 'cause that would make a huge difference if you're marketing house\nTo say hey we can do it but I don't think that people are going to get the release to so\nYou know I'll make a note and all that all they want their apartment to see how many of our loans have been assumed the last\n... years period two years three years to see what they tell us\nYeah and it and then er into not released a liability to ya\nA mask I Would I Would definitely ask about that if he got me interested to see because I don't disagree that we're going to be seeing some of that if if rates continue to climb and as the government stops buying these bonds and they come back out into the into the open market\nI Do think the right they're going to ... we're going to see continual increases and some of the rights because the government is no longer back into bonds I'll get like they have done in the past where\nThe back and um they're just not buying buying them and the right there were correct sorry\nNow let me ask you this didn't feel a little drop this week last week\nIt's go home at your nightly news and watch the ticker at the bottom of the TV show at the bottom of the new show\nAnd it up and down every day every week same thing as I got as the bonds I mean the stock market does well bonds will increase thrilled and that pushes rates down when all the market did bad right now all of a sudden you've got people pulled him our money out of the stock market put into bonds\nThat how it is so it's it's really a funny thing because you almost have to hope for bad things happened in the world to really screw up with stock the stock market and get people to pull money out of stocks and put it into bonds but we're going to\nWay deep and that kind of stuff but I mean it's it's one of those things of bonds like a thirty year you get a thirty year more so it's going to take you Thirty years\nPossibly the make this money back so you have the returns not as good but it's but it's a solid fairly stable return that you're going to get back and just takes longer as opposed to the stock market where you could possibly trade quicker [noise]\nMaking them make us investment and make a return quicker and and make more money faster to do it but it's more risky or to do that which is why they kind of play off each other so much is is one of the longer term safer investment\nYeah so there clearly is operated by a small groups of people who made up fake identities the whole point is that they wanted these account look like they were\nReal Americans tweeting about these things and you can that was true also uh when they were trading up political issues and so these people would be you'd see a twenty four counts to the exact same thing at the exact\nSame time or within minutes of each other and they'd be very politically charged statement saying things\nLike how can the NFL disrespect fly we saw that the majority of the tweets that had a ... or ... what are the researchers called white trolls which means that they were a conservative and they were and those people were typically very much against the player protests\nAre on the other hand you saw some people who are said\nThings that could be seen as inflammatory from the other side and very much strongly in favor of the players\nWere speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Andrew beaten his piece is called how Russian trolls inflamed the NFL anthem controversy a this is still going on I presume has been no attempt to shut this down to be a violation of free speech perhaps but I don't know is there anything like that happening behind the scenes\nOh all the accounts that reference happen shut down um but the\nThe the whole thing is though that when these account to shut down the new ones are made and new ones that are made so what so there's definitely still what the researchers told us that there is definitely accounts there'll be monitored that are that way then more recently a on various topics whether that was\nThe Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick that will also drew a lot of charge reactions or the U.S open fire between Israel Williams and and I only have soccer that also\nReally drew a lot of attention so it's clear that they see sports as a way into the conversation about American culture in a way to sort of discord\nSo they're obviously sowing discord of some kind of does that mean that the tweets are influential\nIt definitely varies I mean some of these\nCats didn't have many followers and probably didn't reach that many people on the other hand there were ... of a cat he's a Catholic grew to have\nA tens of thousands of followers and could have tens of thousands of retreats so it\nSo it definitely varies across a broad range of structure I mean of course it also needs to be\nPut in the context that that there's probably this is just a portion of the giants the of tweets that are sent on the subject that obviously huge conversations for anybody but it's fascinating to see that these
