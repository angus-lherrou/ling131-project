numbers of the latest jobs report from the government the unemployment rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at bank rate dot com ... what's that number means\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nWe believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month in this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially full employment in our country and I've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so [noise] uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with more cameras senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report um\nDoes the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kind of waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nUh well for one that's an average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as for informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I said as we speak in Washington DC and you sit in a good place as well\nWith it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so\nI'm to the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer but it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh\nThe but you know the question really ends up being to some degree\nYou know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend another words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nBut I think for most of us I think the the most important answer to that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impacts of the tax cuts begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably twenty twenty as a date to watch and that happens to coincide ironically or perhaps not what the next presidential election\nNice Mark Mark Emmert senior industry analyst at bank rate dot com\nForce of the program as

party's antidote to President Trump but Mr O'Rourke remains dogged questions that he can turn out the legions of young and Hispanic voters any Democrat will win or rather will need to win\nAn election in Texas He has refused to employ a pollster for air negative TV ads\nThe latest Wall Street journal NBC News poll rated young people and Hispanics as the Democrats least interested in voting in next month's midterm elections here's Wall Street journal national political reporter Reid Epstein read what's going on\nA year and a half or so now better worker ... previously a sort of low profile congressman from El Paso is running for the Senate in Texas like and had Cruz a and he is something of a comment on there\nHe is drawing crowds for a political events a larger than anybody has ever seen in the state in Austin at a concert with Willie Nelson the true fifty thousand people a which is probably the biggest political rallies since President Obama's to make campaign\nBut the question for Mr O'Rourke in for Texas Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nAre as we know from twenty sixteen and past election tend not to show up uh in numbers proportionate to their share of the population early mid term elections were in turn out a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so\nAh the ... campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama ... and that may or similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters or non college educated voters and twenty sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence hurting our data to show that that's going to be the case\nAnd it was the interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters are not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than we are in fact one of the country I think in twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of touch with Spanish for the Republican compared to twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are surely gerrymandered too many Democrats as possible and then and they just haven't seen competitive races\nAre not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for ... ah you know and so that the general elections have been a cake walk shall one party or the up and\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add onto that there really hasn't been a competitive statewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a\nPolitical machinery to get folks out to vote or the ... campaign has had to build that on the fly over the course last year and a half\nA and whether there'll be able to do it uh in time for November six of the big question\nFrom we're speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters to not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nWell just no I mean if you ask a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's come and ask for their God and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the counties that\nEven that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C his campaigning and uh in February when I was down there he was visiting counties a inch having more people show up to his to see him then voted in the twenty sixteen election in those counties\nAre and so he thinks that he's able to draw\nA people out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason for them to court because Texas has been so Republican uh one of the things he says on the campaign trail is that he doesn't believe that Texas has a red state but it's a non voting state or you can just get Democrats to show up\nAh then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is by his house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so there's not while he is certainly been a very compelling on the um the campaign trail has drawn enormous
