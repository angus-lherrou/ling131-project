like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt\nThe two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um they were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two or three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake and like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact [noise] and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto\nThe road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their\nTheir sounds it was in those sim woods where I heard\nThis ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound and I'd encourage you to find out\nWhat coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George ... used to play it I think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame woods\nIt's a unique recording never heard of it before I'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big foot might be dimensional\nMike extraterrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods more I think about it there's our him Ninety nine point nine percent sure those remarks humans\nAnd hindsight I'm

experience and it wasn't until he played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette a national forest or love you know between um mount bachelor and a three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watching the stars and hanging out and then they'll likely music stuff that's just kind of hang out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around her\nHours up there and we went down on a looking at stars who binoculars and I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kinda like hey what are you doing up here you know and and I've\nGot a second guessing but oil it's really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche can personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me and I jumped in my car so bad and got out of there and you know I never really\nPiece it together when it was you know I'm like oh you do a lot of reading wasn't one of the coast to coast and theorists down it was like oh my God that is what it is it
