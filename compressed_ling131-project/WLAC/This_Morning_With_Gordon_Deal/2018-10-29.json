S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise]\nUm you know that this is a an order of magnitude that they can't handle when the uh you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious that\nThinking about this is that they're just a dropping this and some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening in I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts in show [noise] you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a starter suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing um but you know the good news is any package that to put on a plane\nIs screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's ... times to the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far\nThey've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming you get a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is it seemed like an impossibility at this point\nI Do think that that technology is improving and they are capable of doing you know a spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now the you know consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their protocol here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far or sent to the the mail to the post postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult [noise]\nAnd especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with I'm In you know there's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why openly um you know the last in the last line of defense or those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities to stop these also the private and private companies are I think you'll really taking a close eye on these types of packages\nGiven the ah I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber [noise]\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a Ted Kaczynski [noise] you know it took Eighteen years to track down where he was of course in those packages were of course spread out over a much longer period of time in the one we're talking about here but I Do think that you know it's getting easier for us to track\nIs that in that way it is you're always going to have hair that at some things can come back that you're going to get out and I'm very vigilant

around the country I'm the chief from being the Republican incumbents and the district there is retiring [noise] um and so you've got a battle between a long time Republican in the state law or almost became a governor a few years ago\nAnd a brand new political candidate first time a candidate who is a pediatrician from the area and it's a we're seeing a play on districts across the country where there the suburban\nWomen voters who are ... that risk of losing and but the thing about this district in particular outside of Seattle is\nIs a GOP gonna lose those voters at a faster clip than um
