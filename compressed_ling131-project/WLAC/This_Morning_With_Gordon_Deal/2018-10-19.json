certainly know that he's not running again I'm keeping an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to ... sort of just you know basically like a day on\nMultiple districts and\nJust go kind of on his final spent that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help is like to see if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nGeez I so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members then as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his side\nYeah this is really interesting as well I've spent the last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and from a been a thorn in his head either that or tricked conservative fire raid\nMembers of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually signed legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough\nRepublicans named two hundred and Eighteen votes in order to pass anything and they can\nWait out on their own um\nBut they need dying from the frame ... because there's about three dozen that they have power when they sort of voting bloc and they've done that and they've threatened to do that\nAnd so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is it was sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus is not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the

is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely groundbreaking\nHouse we're able to push it is a giant opioids package that was signed into law under President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on these tiny tiny little bells all grouped together a lot of vulnerable Republicans\nHad their names on those bells and painting and all of that but the message basically being you're better off Republican leadership and Democrats\n... they are going further and further can\nOr how will he use President Trump if at all\nI imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going to need to really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our
