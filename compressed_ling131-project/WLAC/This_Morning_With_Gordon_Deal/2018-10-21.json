spending some of this\nHow cool would this have been back in the day of four day school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer could shrink\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country so now hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we um I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district in your early spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they start at noticed and other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or say wow you know what it really does help for the kids get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher actions as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add\nHours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and hours and you know at some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at\nWhen they started when they are when they were all five days if they were already exceeded the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our says you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to\nTo scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I've found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits

and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for it and how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on with it with all the acreage do the trick is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up on us Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV [noise] yes\nAnd and he does a little up front research brings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for this ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is in his exciting it is it it's not going to be the first a breakthrough convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited\nIt because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it that it does or doesn't I I just it it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and every was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and\nSo all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the than it is and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top one will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know and yours is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the

much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nSo we see this alone race along with religion or increasingly starting to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more\nSo you know that sort of suggest that you know even if you say that your political identity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important tea increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer for upshot at the New York times and she's written a piece titled American say their politics do to find them but it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell so do you have lots of different identities at any given moment you know you have a radio show you are a man\nA you know you know from a particular part of the country are you affiliated with your home town\nAnd whichever one of those is important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identities over other identities so for example\nA you know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's more important and then worrying about the the federal deficit\nBut political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in what you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences might shift as well I think it's a little bit sort of surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well

back in the day of four day school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to announce hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we and I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the states so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical a situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant in rural districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to fade and money and when you're in a rural district in early spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation\nBecause everybody's really spread out and I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know there are noticing fewer teacher absence is\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add\nHours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum\nUh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeding the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow that each state decide its own hours and days and I know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\nYes and and exactly and that um ... ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the air for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at our says you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's non profits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nThey basically looked at you know the price of\nMarijuana in different cities across the U.S and Canada and compared it and what they found is that a candidate says about thirty percent cheaper\nAnd Canada than it is in the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because campus was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses a for many years now\nAnd so there's a wider range of dispensaries there's a wider range of producers in Canada and there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that um that wider range of production [noise] ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply you know whereas here in the U.S ah you know except for the states where it's\nLegal or illegal at the federal level and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAre so at the medical marijuana has been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know\nThey have a very large legal candidates industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so you know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and [noise]\nAnd you know if you if you watch the videos and stuff coming in from candidate folks are you know kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with ... capacity personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's the cost breakdown is it done it done by adults I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per eighth up and down on that but the measurement they use [noise] whereas here\nIn the U. S. it's about forty dollars for an eighth of now so you know for a full out you know multiply that out to be about like three hundred and twenty dollars a year and the U.S I'm various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly\nWhere it was most expensive was in San Francisco\nMedical marijuana is legal in California but nevertheless you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up by dispensaries they're still having to you know set up a whole you know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and for that make things harder and drives up the costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say we're all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it'd be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level on yet they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices in other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada worth areas is very robust cannabis industry already in place\nWhich Jacob marketwatch personal finance reporter Jacob ... thirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\nAnd\n\n\n\n\n... and the ad council Raasch Hannity or ... Hannity\nOn Fox News all here\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three and ... than double the ... the ... the headlines\nYou're listening to America's first knew this weekend\nDealing with Jennifer ... coming up this half hour some new thinking about retirement also for Halloween ... scary fickle toddler when it comes to costumes\nAnd in sports the NFL team offering the best return on your

highest court in the land if that happens you effectively destroy the constitution and by doing so the country check on the list Rob Enderle a principal and founder of the ... group\nHas a look at how artificial intelligence could help the process since it has a goal of fixing problems Rob explain\nWell thought that's what got me worked up I think a lot of people watched that got confirmation process some kind of realized the cost us to shop was severely broken\nI'm I'm a guy with the power in a high as it is it's trained correctly is that it's unbiased\nOr it could do a limited investigation of any claim against the candidate age\nBased on publicly available and private information and do so in Buffalo securing confidential fashion so neither that complain and lord of the candidate was put at risk and so much of the drama\nWe saw on television which\nDamaged both participants significantly\nI could've been done ahead of time and then the decision could be reached a with regard to whether or not the candidate or they complain\nThat was Bible about doing so much damage so we pretty much get the same outcome um but but the damage to both parties would be and did that ended the appearance of the court\nWould have been or what have been those tensions reduced and and that's what it is really for it it it helps you get to the meat of a problem provide you with the dice on how to resolve the problem and does show was out this massive amount of drama always seemed to be enduring on pretty much every major decision\nRight so how could it potentially handled accusations from the Nineteen eighties\n[noise] well I I I think that that that what it would do is do we go again and it certainly would take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nA of a decision so in other words if if there was a it looks like this particular case we had to complain that said that there was an assault attempted rape\nBut no rape kit no location no time no all the things that would fill out a case even on the next day had had happened the day before that would allow prosecutor to bring the ... the case for\nWas named exist and and so I Would likely come back very quickly and say okay we we need these elements otherwise there's no point in frustrating because there's no there's nothing there's no substance here and so it would allow they went dead et cetera\nTo find time got the show no way back in July it would say okay this doesn't meet the threshold you're going to need these five things you're going to need to go out and get these five things will or this has to pursue their horses we saw none of those things\nHad been achieved by the time it finally went on to television and so you're either meet the threshold or it doesn't do a threshold limit does it would've detail what you needed to do to get there and then if you didn't want to do it then that's your decision you can certainly still go forward and tried to disrupt these people's lives but\nIf you want to be successful it will allow you to prioritize your resources\nTo see if you could find these other elements in and and make the case rather than just get everybody angry\n... speaking with tech analyst Rob Enderle a principal and founder of the ... group he's written a piece about how artificial intelligence could help clean up something like the Senate confirmation process for a Supreme Court justice um I guess too though\nThere could be accusations of biased in how the AI was programmed right or how data was input\nAlways always the case that is one of the reasons why I went to IBM and the peace because I get my early on as opt up with the theories of procedures\nAnd practices that allow you to create an eye on that I'm biased and and realize a bias day I as a medic on a whole bunch of fun because we're increasingly going to be depending on how to drive our cars or make financial decisions for us make medical decisions for us and so if you if you if you don't eliminate the bias at the end\nSadly you're going to get in procedures that are you don't need or worse could make you sick or you have cars that drive off bridges and uh and more does is going to happen to you about a robot that led to go and same\nSex rub check and all is Robyn early principal and founder of the ... group reminder by the way we can connect on social\nWhat we're what we're used to seeing at that point in time and and I think there's reports we're getting ready to cover kind of support that\n[noise] yeah there's there's names like ... ... um she does dizzy report and then there's a ...\nA senior economist on here there's first Americans chief economist on here a\nFinancial analyst and journalist or people that are talking about this US News and world reports I mean there's tons and tons and tons of information about people going out there on record him basically saying that\nIf there's going to be a a recession that coming up that it's not going to be caused by house related activity in the house the sector will be one of the leading sources that come out of the recession [noise]\nSo I mean there's a lot of positive information about it um they go on to make another statement well much remains unknown about the precise path that the U.S economy in the years ahead another housing market crisis is unlikely to be the central um corporate\nAnd nation allowed turned out turned down or or downturn in productivity so\nReal estate is definitely getting earmarked as the strong source in the whole nine yards we're not going to see any kind of a downturn and if we do I mean okay so we're slightly off marks of what we're what we are projected to do but it's not going to be a negative growth situation or anything like that [noise]\nNo I don't and you know all the indicators that we show all indicate the fact\nYou know housing would be one of the last time we covered the statistic I Wish we had with is what the true indicators were going to be for a\nUh for the cause of economic uh you know down turn to that point diamond housing was listed on the number seven of the reasons at that point in time that it would go down so that doesn't mean people aren't gonna you know ... ... jobs will end up turning over or or whatever but I don't think it's gonna be nothing like we've seen in the past\nTo do that and especially in the middle Tennessee region where\nAre you know we're so diverse we never really feel the high high we never really know all the low those um that some of these areas have and you know we stay pretty consistent print daddy for a long period of time in in you know because our economy's diverse uh\nTaxes are fairly low yeah and no income tax in our state um if you ask people from around the world are housing is actually relatively affordable you talked about that earlier in the show it's been a expensive to us a native of people but um I consider myself a native now but\nMaybe there's a lot of I've been here Twenty years so I consider myself a native at that point yeah so so yeah so most of the economists feel like there's some sort of correction I like to work corruption recession along\nI'm with you there and [noise] you know one one thing I Want to end the show with is a positive upbeat because I mean we we keep on talking about the recession but I think it's very important\nTo talk about it to balance out any negative news that you're here and be at the news and give me that the facts and give you guys the positive aspects of it so\nWe're not all doom and gloom by any means but at the same time keeping it real with you but the one in today's show you got something else you\nWent out just gonna say that's what the news does they try to put headlines out there that are grabbing your attention and you know and it just like saying that the storms are coming you know people are rushing the kroger's or try to buy all the bread areas\nAnd and stuff like that and then the these little pop up showers come through and there's no don't learn more and our snowstorm or anything like that you know like man that was a waste of time and I just feel like there's so much negativity typically\nIn the news for all kinds of reasons yeah and I just always happens to be one that happened to be plugging folks as is and and like I go back to us that you keep\nThinking that you feel sick or whatever you kind of talking to someone getting sick and\nIt's just like they want something bad to happen\nAnd you know there's so many good things going on with our economy right now especially in the middle Tennessee region at that point Tom jobs continue to come here people continue to move here every day of houses you know people are buying houses all the time people are selling houses all the time and\nYou know you just gotta stay and stay focused on the fact that that things here I think just because you hear something domain is true now\nNow where the jobs reports are still excellent\nYes and it's it's just you got sick with a grain of salt but\nPositive note in this show I always loved these articles that we post on our blog and the reason why we did on July seventeenth was for real reasons why we buy homes for Jimmy yet surf fire way\nGive me one of them what do you think one of them are um long term to save money bingo and the number is uh which one was it a a\nNumber I must say that AS number [noise] no actually that's number one I'm Sorry I was looking way down and it was like where is that owning your own offers used ability just starting to raise your family so I Would group that into you know given you to save the money because you're going to\nHave a fixed payment you know what your mortgage that'd be whereas you rent it today [noise] what's your landlord gonna raise you ran up to when you're when Arlene ... every year you're going to get some sort of increase\nWith a house\nProvided taxes you know your property tax don't change much insurance don't change much it's still a relatives you know small increase if they do but the bigger thing about our house every time you make that mortgage payment you're paying yourself because you're also paying principal\nAnd you're building your own equity you're building your own wild and your own wealth exactly wealth building exactly for savings is like I like to call it [noise] um [noise] number two unless there is no place like home\nOwning your own home office you the ability to not only have safety and security but it also the comfortable place that allows you to relax after long crazy day at work\nYou know yeah you can kind of get that when a house I mean with an apartment if you're renting but how long have you really gonna be there before you have to move again or before they raise the rent up too much to where you can't afford to live there anymore so\nThere's also things you can do with the house you can't do with an apartment like you can do a fire pit in the back yard and the hot tub\nOr this number four yeah you're allowed to enter already up in the line you ... over renovations updates in style\nYou know going back to the no place like home people call me all the time that are just in panic we're looking for help or referrals were the people the house have sold that they're renting yeah in the new buyer wants them out now\nNow get in there like we have nowhere to go we can't afford anything else do we have any rights and ultimately if in young surprisingly people's leases as has expired or they're just like a month to month leases\nAnd you have no you have a thirty day right at that point in time so if somebody really likes where you live in and you think it's really cool that you don't have a lease in place and you know you could go at any time just understand that the\nFlip side of that is that you could go anytime yes or you're right could go up at any time the house could sell them people that have you have no rights\nTo say anything other than that people can give you a thirty they noticed to move out or resign at least ... under their terms\nAnd then there goes that being able to come home after work and relax after long day's work\nNow you're coming home that you're at work with the anxiety through the roof figured trying to figure out where are you gonna move to in two three four weeks\n[noise] I've I've got somebody that had the attendant that when this is a whole nother deal but the people call them in the fall of the least because they wouldn't show the house was up for sale and they refused they weren't a cooperative with showing on the house because I didn't want to move into the landlord didn't found them in violation of beliefs and it started the eviction process\nSo what what other changes I guess from the the last time survey versus the this time survey\nOne thing that hasn't really changed and and it's been accelerating of at the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature your religion whether you are religious or non religious heal race they have come\nInto alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm In uh Nineteen nineties that ah\nI'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics but now it is increasingly the case in non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people I'm much more likely to be Republicans\nI'm you know we're seeing a much clearer sort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented whites and non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nSo we see the pillow race along with religion or increasingly starting to get an education to that and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more\nSo you know that sort of suggest that you know even if you say that your political identity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important team increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nSo to speak with Emily badger writer for upshot at the New York times and she's written a piece and settled Americans either politics do to find them but it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell so you have lots of different identities at any given them an you know you have a radio show you are and then\nUh you know you know from a particular part of the country is silly it with your home town and whichever one of those is important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know\nPeople policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identities over other identities so for example\nA you know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's more important and then worrying about the the federal deficit\nBut political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats\nTo sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their views shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in you're thinking about but\nAh that that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion than we reach\n...
