area and it's expected to hit sometime I think later today so now up to a category for hurricane Michael we got another hurricane Michael Michael ... the c._e._o. and editor in chief\nOf the Tennessee star here a big news yesterday I I guess it was a shock in some ways right that the Nikki Haley has stepped down as the ambassador to the un for the United states was I think that's somewhat of a surprise or at least at this time I think\nYou know we talk about how rapidly the news changes here in every day you\nGet to you can't take a day off I mean you literally during the Trump you know sort of administration and the yeah it could happen two or three big stories every day right\nYeah and it's a little bit unsettling how rapidly it happens hum button that's where we are right now you know she's I remember you know growing up I mean there would be big news stories but you'd like have you know one a month I seem to have like one an hour it kind of wears you out\nYeah ... that's not enough Donald Trump tweet something than you are right that used to be like a week\nWent through a day twenty four hours now they're like twenty four minutes I'm so Nikki Haley what an interesting story this is you know ... what do you make of this um so it's a sudden announcement it's the day after the ceremonial confirmation\nOf Brett Kavanaugh she a ... was a popular but somewhat controversial governor\nOf South Carolina she wasn't never Trump or for a while in two thousand sixteen\nUh I think her appointment as UN ambassador was a bit of a surprise her performance as you him ambassador representing the interests of the United states has been a well regarded she's gotten good marks for that and yet\nI'm there are there are still lingering questions about our loyalty to President Trump she had been rumored maybe to be you know the the the the source of the the anonymous op ed criticizing the president that went to New York times she had to issue a denial of that that you know ran in the Washington Post\nA it's an unusual decision though for her to the sides are now the official line as well you know she was governor for ... years um she's been doing this for two years she's tired she wants to break maybe\nI also saw did you see this insider business set apparently there's some potential ethical problem coming up a a report ... with her about a free plane trips that sort of thing\nNo I didn't see that um I like you I'm anxiously awaiting someone to be ideas leak information to Dallas exactly\nYou know what the timing was about him and why she stepped down everything you've said\nA right there is is kind of part of the uh you know the speculation uh that's been going on here I actually had another take now maybe there is something there that we you know just having heard about yet but I was thinking that she might be because she is sort of the rising female star in the Republican Party for\nA possible presidential run at some point um or be a VP candidate suddenly like that that may be a just because there's this concern\nThat the Republicans might not do well in the midterm elections and maybe the timing there you you get out a little bit early or at least and make your announcement that you're leaving so you don't do it after you know say they\nAre let's just say things don't turn out well and and they lose a one of the houses of Congress in something like that so I'm thinking maybe there's some connection there but then you know I have nothing to base it on other than just the the speculation is going on\nThe other thing that was interesting about this dog is the way they made this announcement typically what you'll do is you know there'll be a statement released by the personal resigning and then the president will say something you know\nModerately nice about the person even if they want to you know if they fire them so it certainly President Trump is not fired her this is something that she has decided to do\nAnd the way that they did the announcement was very press savvy\nThey they instead of just exchanging statements ... she was in the in the oval office with the president and he sent out a tweet ... before hey my good friend I have a big\nTo get out there and run I mean would that uh I don't know it would be as as crazy as when the President Trump yesterday mentioned that his daughter Monica my ... un

ten W. I. Lacey the Tennessee Starr Report early edition with Doug ... and Michael Patrick Leahy\nAlright thank you welcome back five fifty one or time here on the Tennessee Starr reported the early edition Hillary Clinton said we got to get the Dems control of Congress so we can bring stability back to politics\nAnd we just happened to catch Hillary hid microphones ... singing\nI tried to saying how big Durban\nWhy Elizabeth Warren on a story book or a gay Spartacus you got to raise the village\nOf all people Hillary Clinton's\nWanted the telling us we need some stability back in politics right ...\nThe best response to that yeah so I was President Trump [laughter]\nThey played that clip for him and she says he said you know now you know why she lost [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nI Know the basically the deplorable ... yes comment again the unworthy Trump supporters you know we don't have to be civil to them\nUntil we control the power or in the legislative branch can you imagine yeah sort of like a federally lave [laughter] on the ice will they be to us\nOh yes uh well they'll just tell us what to do raise our taxes [noise] um I don't know but some kind of restriction on this list you know go back to 'em all the regulations right I mean that that's that's the ability or Michael then you know that that's ... that's what we need\nMan you know if I Hope she keeps talking and talking and talking don't you think the\nDemocrats wish you would stop talking I mean seriously I mean a okay she uh you know she lost the election\nUh she didn't I mean she tried twice right there's some thought that she still after you're thinking maybe that people will come to her again I mean it's uh\nI'm I'm with you I think the more she talks to the better it is because there's not a maybe Elizabeth Warren good rival her at some point being maybe the most likeable Democrat out there what do you think she's definitely got to be at the top I mean who else is more likeable then Hillary\nWell you know here in the thing is even people who vote for her don't really like her no not at all that that's it now I mean after\nThe I mean I I don't remember anyone saying anything really like oh I Love you know Hillary Clinton got anything ah because she ... she was like to believe in when Bill Clinton was president right people I mean how many polls rabid Bill Clinton people like them but they didn't care much for the first lady [noise]\nDo you think Bill Clinton really lecture [laughter]\nPlus a look at look at the record [laughter] I Would say like would that be the word I Would use a [laughter] tolerate perhaps maybe oh yeah yeah he provides an example of tolerance\nTo be able to get anything done there is a ticking clock the day you walk in and if you want to get anything done policy wise you've got to get it done during that brief period that brief window that you're there and and so there's a lot of it but now this isn't to say that there's not a lot of commitment by law the federal employees were there the careerist\nBut there is a different level of commitment by the political because there there with a specific job a specific policy agenda and a brief time to do it so so it isn't an intense job and I think working for this particular president is is even more intense in terms of the emotional and\nAnd time demands that are put upon you and your staff first of all they haven't filled most of the slots around various cabinet officials I don't know about the un particularly\nBut I Know that it's state and other places there are still dozens and dozens of senior staff positions that either the Trump Administration hasn't promptly filled or the Democrats haven't haven't confirmed in the confirming process and if you haven't confirmed the boss they haven't filled the slots below them so you've got these agencies two years in\nOperating with a it was kind of ghost staff in many cases they're just it's not a full staff and it makes it even harder on those that are there that are working to to have to pick up the slack for all the people who are who weren't at their desk because they haven't been hired yet they haven't been put in positions so\nI I don't think there's any question that Nikki Haley is leaving because she wants to take a break and frankly\nStarting with the one of my buddies who worked in the White House last night I said look she's she's going to make three or four million dollars next year I mean her speaking fees will be a hundred grand each the day she leaves I mean she can give fifty speeches [laughter]\nAnd make five million dollars that the speech a week\nShe can do a book and a book tour next year and get an advance of of three to four million dollars she has a family she has kids say at some point they're going to think about having to send them to college so you start putting college funds together and she's got a political career ahead of her\nBut there are these brief again kind of windows where somebody like a Nikki Haley can go out to make a ton of money not ill legitimately I mean I I don't think because she would go on to the political arena again pretty quickly you're going to you're going on a lot of boards corporate boards and those sort of things because just the\nThe process of extra catering firm that stuff if you get another political appointment becomes difficult but in terms of going and giving political speeches I I think are not political just paid speeches again I guarantee you they can book fifty hundred grand speeches for her to speak to corporations speak to group streets Oregon organizations\nAnd again fifty speeches hundred grand\nMy my quick University of Tennessee methods that's about five million dollars\nWell putting aside for the moment the potential intrigued there whether or not she is still secretly it never Trump or a to her credit she did a really does she been well regarded terms of her tenure there at the United nations as ambassador most people have said she's been the best United Nations investor since Jeane Kirkpatrick\nThat's a pretty high standard my at\nThe same type of a ... ... people looked at her when she was perspective but she's she's a good looking woman she's got a got that soft rhino approach meant ...\nShe she brought it to some speeches she gave you know taking taking those little little countries that like to kick sand in our face it the United nation while we pay all the bills [laughter] I mean she she gave some speeches that that were akin to what my mom used to bring me down address me down if I had acted out and and I don't think anybody thought she wasn't tough enough for the\n... nobody really wanted to to take her on because she was very effective in that regard my guess is I I Would that she said publicly that she will campaign for President Trump and twenty twenty my guess is that she's going to do exactly as you say go out and make a lot of money\nCampaign for Trump in twenty twenty standing outside and I'll tell you what she has her eye out\nYou know what it is secretary of state ... state I think pumped pay when two years ago as

are going to do a road\nTrip to gather at there they're going to start doing a series of evenings with the Clintons and and they're charging like six hundred and Ninety nine dollars does that sound like a little bit of a discount or things like you know if you go to Walmart and and all the prices are seven Ninety nine they don't want to make it a because it might be too much for somebody to\nTo to pay so it's it's six hundred and Ninety six dollars and now the United states seven hundred dollar six hundred Ninety nine bucks\nTo go spend an evening with the Clintons I don't even think the Clintons want to spend an evening Clinton's no and I just have this visual of the stage set up he'll get to be in these lounge chairs with bullet proof glass between them just I think security is

Aberdeen was Hillary's chief of staff and and bad carrier and cover up girl so I mean again just they're getting the band back together\nI Do think though that that we should also add a St James Comey

know a lot of the\nNation is producing this year they do concert tours and they're the ones that have that have put this together because they think a lot of people will pay money to go\nSpend an evening with the Clintons as this one where after the first couple of them people you know the word seeps out it's kind of what they say it's going to get covered they can say well the media's not invited it's not going to matter somebody's going to be there and they're going to take notes or were recorded in some way and then they're going to say this is what they said\nAnd people are going to go well that's all they're going to say I'm not that interested it's how the book publishers get get people to write some stuff that may not be true so they can put out the snippets to sell the book and make all they've got their ... their laying out the dirty dark secrets of the Trump Administration the Obama administration whatever\nAnd and that's how they sell books I think that's what ... they're going to do here they are going to leak out a few things that that they may say\nWell I I think this is just to the next step in Hillary's rehabilitation program so that she can once again run for president in ... I think we\nCan we get ban and on the line I think the counter I think the counter events in the same town the same nights featuring I'm Paula Jones and money to Broderick and\n\nMaybe a blue dress did we get a long list on loan from the Smithsonian Smith is at the Smithsonian actually we can get it on loan it takes to press on to her I mean that I think I think we could make just about as much with the counter to her as they're going to make on their evening with the Clintons and ours will be a lot more fun and will will serve alcohol\nAnd stuff I think you'd have to have alcohol to get through and he just to make through that entire ... maybe even heavy drugs I mean we're talking like Matt Cain or a cocktail of of it all\nBecause they will be just you know fingernails on chalk board\nThe I'd have I'd have to be comatose I think to get through an evening of cars you know she's going to do that cackle who who who of course is going to deny that he ever had sex with that

to end\nAnd now back to the Tennessee report with the bill and Mike Lee [noise]\nYou know you've had the first lady traveling around Africa this past\nThis week and then you talk about a fashion Easter I mean she she somebody that could you know where a garbage bag and and look and look beautiful but but she's been out there ... you know wearing classic you know the khaki pants and the white\nShirt like she's a star from one of those Nineteen Ninety ...\nMovies and she got criticized millennia Trump got criticized yesterday for wearing a helmet when she's in Africa Europe is helmet she was criticized because it is the ultimate symbol of colonialism\nAnd you know keeps the son out of your eyes millennials that that don't know anything about colonial America have no clue what colonialism actually means\nWhile they're out there pounding on the doors of the Supreme Court anyway she has she has represented as well but hasn't gotten the attention\nAs she goes to um children's hospitals and tours the the impoverished and listens to people and gets a firsthand view of the dire situation in most\nOf Africa and and yet the media is kind of looked the other way now granted there been other things that covered by the cabinet process you've not had the Nikki Haley resignation so so there'd been other things that have occupied the news but but there's this news media blackout about millennia Trump\nThat has been consistent from the beginning how many times did we see\nMichelle Obama on the cover of every freaking magazine\nYou know made up and and a photo shop to the extent that she was almost unrecognizable and yet you've got this the first lady who is a model who is classically beautiful in every way and and brilliant speaks about you know fifty languages if there are that many uh she's\nShe's not on the covers all the time you go through the grocery store you're not seeing her on the covers of all the all the magazines but man Michelle Obama sure was again it is another example of what we're seeing with Google and these others the media is all in for either ignoring the trumps are trashing the trumps versus promoting the Obamas promoting the Clintons the way that they've handled\nOther pieces of this now I bring up Africa that only because\nMillennia Trump was there and and that maybe we didn't get a lot of pictures because the media also doesn't want to play up\nThe I'm a third world status okay maybe even fourth world status of most of Africa I mean we're talking not only dire poverty and disease and and and beyond helplessness\nWith with millions of dollars wouldn't with resources of mining and and other resources available that they have not been able to convert into prosperous progressive modern countries and maybe the media ignores it not only because millennia Trump there's they don't want to confirm\nWhat it was that a president some Trump said about\nBlack hole countries around the world and that we don't want to turn America into into that sort of third world culture and and\nUm financial and economic basis I think and it's been this way let's these other places you know he was criticized and say well why don't you talk about white countries ... named the white countries you know is it's Sweden is at Switzerland you know named the countries\nWhere you have that kind of dire economic situation maybe Bosnia her school vena maybe you've got a few examples around the world\nBut they're not clamoring to come as refugees to the United states at this point in time you've got people that are that or economic refugees coming to get on the backs of the American taxpayers\nAnd that's what President Trump was talking about and in many of these places they're coming from our are places where terrorism is a part of the country is a part of the government and you cannot vet people when there's no vetting process in their home country so [noise]\nSo maybe the media's ignoring it because they don't want to highlight what Africa actually is in in most of the countries in in that continent\nWell that's true and also the other interesting part about this if you look at the uh the number one country for refugees coming to the United states the past several years to spin the Democratic Republic of Congo [noise] so obviously for trouble there but you know some people I'm a I\nThink that that Africa would be a great place to be\nHere you've got ... you know he was the the former University of Tennessee football star\nDidn't get nearly the carries and the touches that he should have your coach puts Jones over there that that had this premier running back and Everytime he did get a touchy he showed even in college that he had game well he goes to the pros and he has been an absolute phenomenal superstar for the New Orleans great player\nAnd yet this week after the saints beat\nThe Washington Redskins can we still say Redskins on the well they beat him sound like they they beat them sound like a it was probably racist because you know they were they were beating the Redskins if if they had a different name they wouldn't have beaten and but but because they had that name they beat them down and and and of course it was the saints\nAnd it sounds like a little bit of a religious undertone there and and I'm not sure you can use that name in the NFL in any event you have Alvin ... come era wearing a hat after their when in a Jersey a cabinet and not a a capital Jersey Kaepernick Jersey after the game\nYou know making the point that he's a at least they closet neither if he's not willing to do it right there on the field before the game and wearing a red hat a Trump looking hats\nThe the red hat with the white letters like make America great\nAgain and what does that have say\nMake Africa home again make Africa\nHome again now if you're going to have all that right well yeah the African football league the AFL I I don't think it pays nearly as much I don't think the TV rights or as as a result sounding as you do with the NFL I I don't think the uh the travel experiences and the stadiums would be nearly as nice but if you haven't come era wants to go to Africa and make Africa home again\nDon't at the door hitch in the bud on the way out to sea nobody's keeping your ear you're not being restrained you don't have to stay here you can give up your NFL contract tomorrow Alvin uh and and and had to Africa\nContracts that are just like we\nDo down here in Lebanon area forty forty lessen their south Harlem and it looks like we've got a check on that in your late ... and they're here we had a crush more\nFor you can ... or phone suddenly in town but it ... from on our ...\nA focus\nGoal to me that's always been too narrow way to limit it I've had a wire bra face all life\nListened to the air is ... wants to be the most listeners has ever will be\nThe defined as we said that he\nHow long will it take you to get from Mallory lane to Madison Time saver traffic follows Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen cent W ...\nAnd now back to the tendency to report with the jail and Mike lady [noise]\nIraq back in this is the Tennessee star reports the bill Michael Patrick Leahy with us today as always into you can join us on the phone lines of seven three seven nine five to two that's seven three seven W LA see a man I got to tell you I I\n... this whole support animals stuff Michael's kind of driving me nuts when you've got people that you know they would have the support dogs and they start wanted to bring them on airplanes and and and I I understand when you've got\nYou you may have site issues you may have hearing issues and you need you need a dog a guide dog to help their I don't have any problem with that at all that's that is a great thing\nBut then you had people started developing this I Need an emotional support animal I mean if you're so freaked out and so out of control that you need an emotional support peacock or pig or shutting pony to accompany you everywhere you you've got problems that aren't going to be cured traveling to wherever you're traveling to\nWell it frontier airlines flight was delayed on the way from Orlando to Florida yesterday um but I ended up from Orlando, Florida is a Cleveland due to an emotional support\nAnimal and and the airline saying no no we don't do emotional support animals\nThat are rodents woman or\nBoarded the flight in Orlando saying her squirrel ... was an emotional support animal\nThe airlines are the passenger noted in a reservation that she was bringing an emotional support animal but did not indicated that the animal was a squirrel French airlines has rodents including squirrels\nAre not allowed on it's like the woman was advised of the issue and actually get off the plane she refused and finally police were called and everybody had to the plane to deal with the woman and her emotional support squirrels\nSee I I could see Alvin and the chipmunks as being emotional support animals but you know squirrels\nNo yeah that or [noise] or or the pigs or the Shetland ponies is like you know I ... the plane seats are close enough in tight enough now that I don't need somebody with a pet pig trying to squeeze under the seat next to you on the plane and\nYou know again it is just that\nWe've gone absolutely crazy in this country and were were embracing crazy letting crazy run amok without saying I'm Sorry no at least God Bless frontier airlines for saying no we're going to draw the line at an emotional support\nBut I think it starts you know in high school and college don't think if like safe puppy petting zones in college as al I read that somewhere\nYeah it's the snowflake generation the everybody gets a trophies I mean I sound like my dad got off by large [laughter] back in my day we didn't have emotional support rodents but but there were things that worked a lot better back when we had some sense of rational behavior in this country\n... lack in mind that you know I walked a mile to school in thirty degree below temperatures uphill both ways both ways ... with us choose you know I went back and I and I actually looked and it's it was like half a mile and it wasn't really thirty below it was you know thirty above but down to the story changes\nFirst grade elementary school Montgomery, Alabama del Rey to elementary school my my I was in the air force so we went to ten schools before I got out of high school but we spent first through third grade at the ready to elementary school in Montgomery, Alabama that was about six blocks away and you walk to school and it was about half a mile\nAnd you had to walk past you know the kind of a ... at home that was like a scary house it looked like a haunted house and so you kind of rush that\nThat a short segment but I I Can't imagine that today you would let your kids distraught off you know at seven thirty in the morning to walk you know down busy streets and you know walk a half mile the school and and we didn't think anything of it but I mean would you let your seven year old child leave the house and just go on a company\nWants to do it but again I same thing with me I I Would walk you know when I was\nFor kindergarten first grade second grade for about a half mile to school and you know all the kids would what was it was safe there was no concern of you know some crazy person pulling up in a van and throwing in and kidnapping you are but\nUh oh I Would never do it would have never done that with with our kids never never never never never\nAs crazy town out there now and again it's it's it's a different\nCulture that we're in I mean maybe I'm maybe we can't go back to a level of where you would even think about doing it but yeah we in the summer when you leave at the beginning of the day\nAnd come back when when the when it turn dark if the streetlights came on you had to come home you'd eat at somebody's house for lunch sometimes that drones have drugs in one of your friends you didn't have cell phones you just rode your bike to somebody's house and say are you here yeah exactly exactly would gather and then you would bring more together and and you just play outside all day\nAnd it was easier to develop a sense of friendship and community that way you actually look people in the eyes you can talk to people and you get to always go play sports and so you had a connection with people would would now with ... with a dangerous element of our society kids can't do that\nAnd so they become more isolated I think and they it they depend more on their parents they don't depend on each other they're unable to relate to each other so all in all it it's a change not necessarily for the best\nAnd conflict resolution was you get into a scrap you'd have a little wrestling you might slap each other around a little bit and then the next day it'd be best friends again but it actually it was you found out how to deal with conflict resolution you also found out how how to deal with taking care of folks that they needed help I mean there were there were the kids that were always last picked\nBut but you also had a culture that were developed in in these in these neighborhoods where you'd you'd you'd better pick that kid because his older brother will kick your biography\nThe very first minute Brett Kavanaugh was nominated radical\nWere on a mission to resist obstruct LA demolish and destroy they want to destroy that man [noise]\nBecause they wanted to do with that\nWe understand him out can you do that [noise]\nAgain he he knows his audience is and he's not just plain to the people that are gathered in these big arenas\nHe's he's playing to the TV audience is not boxes in covering I'm beginning to end because the the rallies are pretty much the same they are now saying what what kind of way or will cut back to the president if but if he says anything that's newsworthy in these same pretty much the same stuff here's another clip from what what do you have to say the crowd last night again they were they were eating out of his hands\nThey want to destroy everything that's all that good at resisting campaign is resist [noise]\nHours to create [noise]\nGreat point great point ours is to create one of the Democrats born I think over the next few weeks\nYou're going to hear more and more Republicans on the campaign trail in these house races in the Senate races talking about great they hate Trump they hate America their their frenzied and crazy\nWhat are they for what are they gonna do here's what we've done we've repair the economy after after eight years of Brock Obama in a way that nobody thought was possible we've changed the dynamic in the international arena

L. A. C.\nDo you think the Republicans keep the house keep the Senate and the midterm elections we're going to find out and just to be short weeks but we'll take your prognostications\nThis morning as well also what do you think you would go to the Hillary and bill intimate evening if somebody gave you a free ticket now the tickets are seven hundred bucks I mean the Clintons are needing cash so they're they're trying to figure out how to to grub some money now that the Clinton Foundation can offer up\nInside or a sort of government opportunities\nFor those that are willing to buy access so they they can't really play that game any more so now they're new game is they're going to go out and talk to people\nIn charge seven hundred bucks a person with these um with these intimate evenings\nIf any of the south and people that you know we talk and seven hundred seven hundred and fifty thousand bucks a night that's\nNot a bad play they they do well you know fifty of those that's that's real money that's real money even even though the Clintons will pour through it and they've got this massive team\nThat they have to support him you know Chelsea is\nIs a incapable of doing anything that would actually be productive in in earn any money other than than can again playing the Clinton game where she's now on a board of of yet another company that's paying are like Fifteen to twenty million dollars because\nHer business savvy and expertise is really worth ... any anyway so the Clintons are are back out there trying to earn some money and then yesterday Nikki Haley shocked everybody I think the most shocking thing is that it was kept a secret you didn't even tell her staff\nUntil yesterday morning there were no leaks there was no\nIndication that this was coming and yet Nikki Haley announces that she will be stepping down as a our ambassador to the to the un are not sure what she's going to do next I think she's being completely honest when she says look I I've been been busting it for the last fourteen years or so both as a legislator in six years as governor and the last two years\nIn this a high profile high intensity job\nAnd Nikki Haley somebody to go out and and it I don't know fifty thousand a hundred thousand dollars a pop go give some speeches herself and over the next couple of years generate a lot of money that will allow her to pursue an additional political career moving ahead in and we'll see how that plays out now who replaces\nHer that that was the parlor game that started before they even had the the announcement of exactly why she was leaving and and what she was going to do next and up in one of those who has\nHas moved into a key position as a kid visor to Donald Trump formerly held the position held by Nikki Haley was praising her just about a year ago when she was that when she was appointed John Bolton\n\nWell I think he's doing a great job I think she's a very effective a spokesperson for the United states [noise] ah I told her a couple of months ago I was up in New York I was really envious\nOf her because she seemed to function without the supervision from the state department is I Wish I Wish I could have said the same but uh it's uh it's obviously something that the gets a lot of attention around the world I think she's stayed close to President Trump and reflects his views [noise]\nAnd uh and you know some of these areas like around like North Korea and how it plays out in the un has an effect on us so you have to take it seriously whether the whether you like it or not it's a part of the real world we operate out\nYou know some of the meeting yesterday we're talking about the fact that that might ... that the secretary of state is her boss that's not true the UN ambassador\nHas direct access direct report to the president nine states it's a cabinet level position she is not having to report the patio now the state department tries to exercise authority over the United nations ambassador as as John Bolton pointed out\nAnd as the president noted yesterday she has um moved this position up she's made it a more powerful position a more glamorous position and I think it it is now a position that more people will want as a political position in in part because of what Nikki Haley did and how she did it\nYes she made it a very high profile did a very good job by a by all accounts now I think that that my personal recommendation if the president were to call me which by the way he's not going to do but if he were to call them or you can\nCall us on air somebody draw seven nine five to let us know when\nI Would recommend that John Bolton former communications director when he was UN ambassador ah Richard Grinnell who is a very effective spokesperson he's he he was involved in some controversy back in two thousand twelve because he's gay\nUh and was for a time Mitt Romney's a advisor some of the social conservatives got upset about some things he'd set on that and and he
