Thursday morning October nineteenth edition\nOf the Tennessee Starr Report the early edition here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten a W well ISI phone number to call any time during the program today is seven three seven W. L. A. C. eight hundred six eight eights W. L. A. C.\nAre going to be with you this morning and uh we will continue our discussion ears were only Nineteen days away from the mid term elections\nAnd that will get some perspective on that uh during the program the uh media following a story this morning Don McGahn the White House counsel has resigned I this was kind of expected or that\nHe was leaving at some point this fall and um anyway the apparently he has a either made the announcement or he has left but the the media sort of focusing on that show this morning um [noise] there's also um let's see ah the story where the or\nA president has a you know once again made a few comments dealing with the election and um he thinks there's not going to be a blue wave or he thinks Republicans are going to do well\nUh in the mid term elections or we'll just have to see how it turns out and uh he was also disputing and one of his interviews yesterday headlined that the a P\nAd on that interview they did with him about uh whether he would blame Republicans if you know things didn't turn out well he uh or with whether he would take the blame I guess would be the proper way to put that uh Michael Patrick Leahy is here the c._e._o. and editor in chief of the Tennessee star and we've got some more information about\nThe whole Elizabeth Warren thing I tell you what you know Michael the er er I there hasn't been a really a subject for this kind of a comedic fodder social media in a while we needed this right I mean we we\nComic relief yes\nWe needed this and are you ... you mentioned the story yesterday and you actually a a habit at Breitbart the dot com and uh I'm sure a link to it at the tendency star but the the the fact that you know you start digging into your background you started doing these DNA tests it doesn't necessarily turned out the way maybe university would write\nNurtured us and you know and Elizabeth Warren has created her own DNA disaster and just sort of kind of create this you know she claimed Thirty years ago that she was a Native American and uh that was she put that on a resume back and\nWhen she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania law school it helped get hurt in an interview at Harvard law school which are needed to more diversity in its faculty\nAnd uh she was hired at Harvard in part based upon that [noise]\nNow Thirty years later she has yet to produce a single piece of historical documentary evidence to support that\nAnd in addition so finally she has come up with what she purports to be\nGenetic evidence now are there are all sorts of problems with this genetic evidence or going from a chain of custody by the the\nReport or would not be accepted by a court of law because there's no chain of custody in other words her DNA sample was sent to a DNA lab [noise] um\nAnd that lab sent a report to of just raw data to a professor at Stanford University\nThat professor has no idea\nIf the DNA ... a data that he's looking at is Elizabeth Warren's because there's no chain of custody to confirmed that but put that aside from\nGiving us the benefit of the doubt that report says she has anywhere from one tenth of one percent to one point six percent Native American ancestry asterisk\nThe way they define Native American is not a Native American from a tribe in the United states they divided broadly as as a someone who could have been from South America\n[laughter] so you know they are you going to lose everything and you do but I'm an amateur genealogist and I I wrote a story at Breitbart ... six years ago where I documented that or she is a direct descended or her great great great grandfather Jonathan Crawford\nUh lived in Bledsoe county Tennessee and as most ah Tennessee in ... in that era most male fantasy as he was a member of the Tennessee militia\nAnd we have the muster robot shows in the Eighteen thirties uh he was a a a private in the tendency militia outfit that rounded up the Cherokees okay we we've got that proven yet I was like ooh ooh ah so what what it means is\nShe had she is three percent descended from\nA tendency to an ancestor who rounded up the Cherokees and the maybe the maybe what if it was dry essay descended from some Metsu American so you know it's just a embarrassing for her and it's just the gift that keeps on giving [noise]\nYeah I mean the the ah the jokes are everywhere everyone's got one uh you know what I think we mentioned as yesterday but somebody posted on Facebook or on my page that uh they're they're great grandparents had been found that it was a picture of Kevin Costner in is a girl oh yeah that would be a ... lawyer\nHey speaking of that we have a real a dissent\nUsed code trust that code Trump trying not to the beauty of Madison read\nWe gave them and I always think of somebody complaining them either\n... to fix it does complaints department and most of the time it's not the case there just venting is over but I think I have a responsibility to fly from what the hell of asking for\nRush Limbaugh and that's why I don't whine and complain because I\nThink I'm asking for something so\nWho I have to completely the other day on TALK radio Fifteen ten\nW well ac Dave Ramsey weekday afternoon from five to light on talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen cent W. I. Lacey Tennessee star reports\nFor early edition with Doug Kelly and Michael Patrick Leahy [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHey and welcome\nBack by Seventeen this morning Tennessee Starr reported the early edition of the Washington Post has a headline here I haven't read the story yet this morning but it says Elizabeth Warren does not think this DNA test a revealing she was one one thousand twenty four if the Native American is a mistake\nAnd uh I you know it's I think everyone else does I think there is not you know I I think it's Ninety nine out of a hundred percent believe that it wasn't a mistake for her to go down this road but um apparently in a story with the Washington Post ah she's telling them it's not a mistake you she kind of gets ready and prepared\nA very possible twenty twenty presidential run at least with a lot of people think is going to happen you know I'm Michael there's an interesting story the hill that Congress morning has about the Claire McCaskill in Missouri and I know you follow\nThe elections not just in Tennessee but elsewhere but the same thing with the project maritime as James O'Keefe organization where they did an undercover video showing basically just average talking about how she says one thing publicly trying to appeal to a more wide range of voters but then a that basically not telling the truth about really some of her\nOr more a big string sort of a liberal policies\nAnd a very similar to what a project varied ties did here in Tennessee with the British in\nA campaign and she's calling for attorney general to investigate it have a special prosecutor to look into a or investigator to look into project Barrett dies those kind of interesting he's a he's got the undercover videos going everywhere it appears huh\nYou know who the attorney general of ah I'm In Missouri is Josh Hawley her Republican opponent so this is a political effort on her part [laughter]\nTrying to deflect yeah you know uh apparently project very toss James O'Keefe does he's undercover videos of went into a number of Democratic Senate campaigns particularly in red states\nAnd as we suspected he found that you know the staffers are in those campaigns are far left liberals and they they admit\nOr more times than not about the you know what James who keeps people find when they do these are the videos I think the other thing is uh you know how does he get these people in in there to get these video sometimes it's a it is pretty\nAmazing very odd element you know there is an element of undercover deception right they oh sure yeah they yeah they they of course if you do this from a liberal if sixty minutes does it it's like award winning surprise warning time get the words I look at it\nAs sort of journalism you know what I mean if you're you have to if you're going to do something to find out what people are saying buying closed doors especially in a in a campaign there has to be some sort of deception to get there I\nMean I certainly would agree with that but again it's it's about the what's on the radio right or or what are they saying but but when we get back to the idea of the symptom that's you know part of the culture here\nWhere people would think it's okay to lie now it's okay to you know just as long as we get our guy elected we wouldn't be here if you know our candidate really believe these things he's saying out there in the public but we know he's not\nBecause I'm you know when he or she gets elected than uh you know then they'll they're real self will that will come about here that's um that really shows isn't it that the liberal Democrats do not have a generally specially in some states anyway the the argument or the or the policy that the people actually go for if you're real honest about it\nThat we'll be right you know and as an example of and it's not just in terms of you know outright lying\nIt's not just the liberal Democrats who are doing that it's most most of the mainstream media back to the Elizabeth Warren as an example of that you you know the Boston Globe has become essentially a press arm of her campaign office and a\nKid and he's not around any long do they mean I had to move on to somebody else\nSo you know they have misreported this at knowingly misreported this for years\nBack in two thousand twelve there was this phony claim that uh you know her ... great great great grandmother ... might have been Native American and there was no there was a misinterpretation of a family newsletter know historical documentary id bunk fat at Breitbart back in two thousand twelve well guess what that\nThat claim was resurrected\nBy the Boston Globe in an article yesterday and they know is not true there is no Eighteen Ninety four they basically was they claim that an Eighteen Ninety four document\nA purported to show that are great great great grandmother was Native American I got a copy of that document or a marriage license of of of uh one of her sons back there and I'll go home and it had nothing to say about Native American ancestry for the great great great grandmother\nOr the Boston Globe knows that and yet they've actually misrepresented as likely next the [noise]\nHis he's leading facility solutions provider companies trusted by Vanderbilt film I and you ... when you projects are built to learn more at least company dot com were called six one five five six seven one thousand [noise]\nGet ready for retirement [laughter] every time I had my retirement my past I had already had protections for like a Saturday morning a\nMember

welcome Baggett is\nThe very very early edition one of my buddies go this is the deal warm up show\nUh five thirty three duck tale it's my ... ... if you'd like the only guy talk radio has an opening act I mean it's amazing\nAnd I think we do we do a decent job preparing the audience for the humor the energy and a\n... but you know it it\nWas the ... you know we need to beauty sleep made an extra hour well the ... but so he says can you just can you do this first hour for me and like your show while the other\nThing about that here's the good news or it's much better to be the warm up act for Steve Gail then the follow up act I don't want to follow Steve ... ever\nYeah it's all been said right away it's like even ... even Russia has a problem coming up with anything new around that I was going on which is actually really hate to be the guy across the street that's actually been\nReally [laughter] so what's interesting about this is ... ... you know we've been back on the air or for the for weeks now it's been a there are so many people here in middle Tennessee who remember Steve leadership\nIn stopping the a Republican governors plan to put a state income tax here in Tennessee you back in two thousand you know the best one of the killer bees state representative at the time may beavers a state senator Marsha Blackburn\nA as state representative at the time Diane Black and of course Steve but Gail [laughter]\nYou're really trying hard on that whether they're good that's good\nHorn honking uh that ... literally stop the state the tendency general assembly in their tracks from putting a state income tax into the state of Tennessee and then you know last in two thousand sixteen uh now we have a constitutional amendment to the state constitution that prohibits ever ever\nHaving a state income tax and frankly as you know dog that lack of a state income tax is one of the big drivers uh and uh the economic growth of Tennessee\nYeah no doubt about it I I Would have imagined middle Tennessee is probably the\nIs the fastest growing area right now it's um it's really one of them and I'm sure you I mean\nIt's hard to beat a you know when you don't have a a a ... for a competition when you don't have an income tax write I mean only Tennessee Florida\nOr Texas or you know really you know a habit no state income tax so every state touching Tennessee has what I Do want to mention that uh the ... the Starr Report level election night coverage November six seven to ten o'clock you guys will be the cool springs Mariette to black burn election or\nA headquarters in ... what were the result is they come in and Steve will be ah providing coverage along with yourself and I think is the will be also doing channel to ride I mean yeah\nI actually ... I'll be there and and a talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W. L. A. C. we'll be broadcasting live a on Tuesday on election night\nFrom seven pm to ten pm I'll be there come by and say hello and uh at this will be at the cool springs marry often in Franklin where there are so I'll just say hello bring food what do you bring food I mean yeah and ... ... and\nYeah repeats or whatever it may be because it could you know it it actually I may not be as long and I did some in the uh the national news media is hoping for a ride I mean as he might have given up on the tendency race I was watching some of the like CNN and MSNBC I call it reconnaissance\nAnd they were um they seem to think Marsha Blackburn got this one now they they were hopeful but I I detected they they think maybe not the not so fast now huh\nYeah I I think generally speaking uh that the conventional wisdom\nIs that the polls showing Marsha Blackburn in the lead are true and there's probably a question as what the man is but there's a lot of energy on the UP so we have a story of the ah Tennessee star\nAbout a get out the vote a rally that was held yesterday in Williamson county Marsha Blackburn on to the GOP Senate candidate and believe me the GOP gubernatorial candidate and by the way on election night\nIf you're interested and you want to come by the tendency star will also be covering the a a headquarters election night a headquarters activity a belief campaign which will be held at the factory in Franklin our own Chris Butler will be there were actually going to have a\nTwo photographers covering it for the star I'm a one at the leak campaign and the other uh at just ...\nBecause break lights suck time saver traffic coming up on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten\n... see the Tennessee Starr Report early edition with Doug ... and Michael Patrick Leahy\nOne is Kevin ... and the other is caravan\nAnd the combination of anger over how the left smear engaged in character assassination lied used bullying tactics with judge Kavanaugh is going to be one part of this and the degree to wash the left is eager\nTo have three thousand people in a caravan cross the American border break American law recognizing that if that happens next caravan will even bigger and the caravan after that will be even bigger\nAren't new game last night on Fox News channel the hand of the program and\nUh he says cabin on caravan is what's going to lead the Republicans do when the midterm elections are coming up in Nineteen days interesting thought the certainly the the caravan of a it's a pretty large actually are coming from I think Honduras adored the border there's going to be some kind of showdown perhaps\nAbout this or that is going to generate a lot of a media coverage and uh and gives President Trump really the opportunity to point out uh the difference there between his agenda\nAnd that those are the Democrats when it comes to illegal immigration and then of course we know about what happened with a capital a\nNomination or you think Michael that this especially the cabinet or a nomination and the disaster really that the game out of all of that really has energized people right I mean I I I Can't think of anything\nIn recent memory where people to me ah you know would come up in uh what are you saying about this uh on the air I mean is uh\nArguing you know a a furious about all of this and it was amazing the motion really that came out of this from people that normally that I run into that\nNormally don't care about politics all that much yeah absolutely\nI think and I don't think the polls posters are properly capturing all the energy or that you see among conservatives and Republicans ... they had that captured that so so called blue wave effect\nFor some time among the energies judge Democrats and they're the Democrats basically just they hate Donald Trump from\nNow it'll be on that really\nGot 'em going right I mean that was that that's the that was the energy and back then you've got Democrats like Biden saying please don't impeach him maybe [laughter] have you get anything because uh I guess they're viewing and I think you would backfire if the if the dams one to the house and started impeachment hearings\nThey would backfire kind of like maybe even the way the Republicans are you ran into the bill Clinton impeachment back in the nineties right I mean\nPeople kind of looked at it in a different fashion there so\nUm and in this case they would probably view it even more outrageous and then\nA ... and it seems to me that uh he's the you know is right about that it's it don't don't do it don't do it but uh that's what really got 'em going\nYeah I think so and now you know Newt Gingrich a is a very astute political observer and he also knows how to a corner phrase\nSegment thousands I think it's three thousand that's up to four thousand and you're thankful you know crossing Honduras and heading across Mexico to invade our country\nAnd and what are the Democrats talking about what's reopen the cabinet are pro let's impeach Brett Kavanaugh who's the Supreme Court justice [noise]\nWe've got serious problems facing this country and the Democrats want to continue to play the let's impeach let's attack let's go back after Brett Kavanaugh because of all the lies that were told to spare him they want to do another smear campaign if the Democrats take control of the U.S Senate if they take control of the U.S house [noise]\nAnd and yet a new Fox news poll says you know women by an Eighteen percent margin or or favoring Democrats are they not watching are they not paying attention well\nYou know the Fox news pull a ... is suspect\nUh because they they were way off on other elections they typically have been over sampling Democrats for some time as you probably know I I Am very suspicious of those particular numbers and you know Fox News I I'm Sorry to say\nWith the change of the leadership from the uh the founder Rupert Murdoch\nWho's now in his eighties to the sun Laughlin Murdoch who is in his forties and kind of a liberal [noise]\nAh the Fox news of today is not the from the news perspective is not the Fox news of a Roger ales\nWell I decided I'm I'm a drive in this morning I was I was listening to you guys and I was thinking about what we can do to help the ... 'cause you've got all uses you know big or five thousand people that are that are wanting to enter our country because we have more stuff than they do\nYou know their their their reason for coming as they're poor and and we have stuff\nAnd their countries haven't followed the blueprint of America where freedom and opportunity\nAnd the rule of law law create opportunities I mean when it's when it's all bribery and corruption that that couldn't towards economic success to where most people stay locked into wherever they start they can't move up the ladder\nThat's what separates America from the rest of the world you look at in Mexico many this is not to demean Mexico or to be mean to Mexicans or to the Mexican government but let's just look at geography\nThere's really no difference in just across the border and in our direction and in their direction\nYou have the same basic natural resources you have the same climate you have the same deserts you have the same mountains you have the same water there's not any geographic this difference between Arizona and New Mexico and Texas\nAnd northern Mexico not an dimes worth of difference\nThat people are hard working I mean the Mexicans that come here are are hard working hard work for the most part faith based people they have they have the work ethic so there are so different to the people there's no difference in the geography what is the difference why as Mexico impoverished\nAnd New Mexico Arizona Southern California these other areas relatively prosperous\nLess prosperous because all the poor people that come in and climb on the back to the American taxpayers and and could toward our economy down but\nBut much more prosperous than Mexico they've got massive oil resources that's one of the things that that drives their economy and yet\nThey have not become a world power while we watch the economic resources that are generated in Saudi Arabia that make them a major world player simply because they've got an oil under the sand so does Mexico\nSo what's the difference it's the lack of rule of law it's the lack of embrace a real capitalism is the lack of embrace of freedom and it and it pours on down as you go through Central America into South America you look at socialism and Venezuela why as Venezuela\nAs the president might say an asshole country when they have abundance of natural resources they have huge oil resources\n... why is Venezuela such an absolute catastrophe because of how they have allowed their government to govern them this country\nWent through a revolution to throw off that kind of dictatorial we're going to tell you how to live government two hundred plus years ago\nAnd and you've got some of these countries that want the easy pass they they want the HOV lane to success we

website is fly asked president dot com and to go to our tendency star Facebook page you can also\nSee the pictures that we were talking just before the break about about the kind of polling and what we're seeing nationally\nThere is it's not a red wave but you're seeing\nNumbers move in Republican directions in the battleground house districts around the country you're seeing them move in the Senate races that we talked a little bit about in the last segment as well but in the house races you're seeing roll call in these other groups that kind of rate where the races are moving\nIn in the last week you've seen a lot of races move from likely them in to toss up from toss up into into likely Republican or lean Republican there about ten races in the house that have moved in Republican direction that that makes it appear that\nThat either party is likely to maybe have a ten seat margin up or down after the election I still tend to think Michael that that the Democrats because of history because of the number of seats that were vacated by Republicans running for other offices or or running because like all the Jimmy Duncan that have been there forever\nYou have open seats in a lot of districts that that lean blue\nOr that Donald Trump carried by two or three points and I think I think those will tend to as as people kind of retreat to their teams to their corners you're going to see a lot of those open seats move into the Democratic column in the cycle now I think\nThat if you have Nancy Pelosi what the gavel and in America gets a good dose of Maxine Waters and Sheila Jackson Lee and and the we're going to investigate\nBrett Kavanaugh that we're now hearing from Diane Feinstein in the Senate if they take control the Senate and and you've got to the Democrats are wanting to impeach Trump do all this stuff\nOh I think if they take control with a five or ten vote margin in the house they will pay at the next at the next election and twenty Twenty one Donald Trump's on the ballot we may see a forty seat shift you're talking about a wave and and all these Democrats had made narrowly window that the first time you face voters after you win is your toughest race\nAnd and they're going to not want to carry the baggage of Maxine in ... and the rest in fact some of these people as they're running or saying they're not going to back closely they're lying of course I like Bill Braniff is saying he's not going to back Schumer but they're going to have to cast that vote and she is going to have the gamble that they have a majority and they're going to pay a price for that particularly when they said they weren't going to support\nI agree with that analysis if they were to take the house by in right now\nMost prognosticators suggest it they'll have like a six vote margin a I disagree with that but that's what most prognosticators are saying and that is speaker of that house Nancy Pelosi and chairman of but which committee will ah ah Maxine Waters be chairman of the house Judiciary Committee or something like that she\nMay be House Judiciary am I ... I mean she again there was a senior already base deal and you've already got the Congressional Black caucus demanding that that the black house members started being more forceful and urging more violence\nThey follow very nicely loners and so what's going to happen is I think you're absolutely right you're going to see the circus that was on display during the Senate Judiciary committee with Cory Spartacus Booker and a\n... I Want to be president Harris and denying Dick Blumenthal that circus\nThe way I'm going to do a new may mean today I ...
