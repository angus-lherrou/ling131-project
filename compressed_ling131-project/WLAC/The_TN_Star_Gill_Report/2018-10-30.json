I'm not sure maybe speaking at a term but I think there are even some Democrats you might go along with this at least I Know it's been discussed openly in the past\nAbout a as a way of really dealing with some of this illegal immigration you know I I think there would be some maybe some bipartisan support on\nThis yeah and I think you remember how uh how much president former President Obama used executive orders to basically you know a assert\nKind of status regulatory control that the Congress wouldn't do and many people at the time said well that's terrific for him and for the Democrats until a Republican becomes president nobody anticipated Donald Trump would become president they thought it would be Hillary Clinton just\nAdding on to those executive orders as soon as President Trump became president he reversed virtually every one of those executive orders thank goodness\nYeah and that but that is the uh you know if you live by the executive order then or somebody else gets in there with a different opinion you're going to die by them and so it uh it'd be nice if Congress could take this up maybe after the midterm elections that's not going to be possible anyway but uh\nIt'd be nice if we could uh you know have some sort of a law and the book rather than that exist\nFlash free once again the recruiter dot com slash free ... recruiter\nThe smartest way to hire based on trust by the rating of hiring sites with everyone has a radio\nTalk radio and I have probably three Fifteen tend to see what you wherever you go on our radio power fights that her insurance dot com\nAnd when it comes to facilities maintenance and management link company is the trusted expert you get the best with Lee company hardly evil dedicated partners and creative solutions makes a call ... company six one five five six seven one thousand [noise]\nRaasch Hannity on Fox News talk radio tiny eight point three and Fifteen to end\nLocal the Tennessee Starr Report early edition with Doug ... and Michael Patrick Leahy\nThis packet at one of the things that whole we have a ... presidential run on a ... a crowd of radicalization oh has radicalized salmonella more political than I had I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste is that says\nAll right that's a discussion on CNN yesterday Jake Tapper zip program and was GQ column is Julia I hop\nSaying that President Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS every day and that was part of the discussion about the shooting at Pittsburgh\nOr the other day and how a President Trump is to blame or dealing with the shooting and reading the environment that has caused some of the events of recent days Michael ... that never there was no pushback by a by the host their Jake Tapper\nOr the President Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS\nUnbelievable I mean this is the kind of creation as you're dealing with it CNN by the way whose ratings are plummeting I Wonder why\n[laughter] well I mean although I I guess it's provocative in the sense that uh you know you're going to hear that anywhere else right I mean it but you're right you're unable does he said well that's true\nThat's true you know that's interesting the president doesn't call at MSNBC as much as he does CNN that kind of wondered about that because you had your MSNBC is sort of CNN to the next power\nRight I mean that's a very good point in having a theory on that\n... the theory is a it's a it's an easy to confuse M. S. N. B. C. with NBC I mean it's it's a fact part of NBC\nAnd uh it is easier to um uh respond to CNN because CNN is so over the top at every level I mean he got Don Lemon Anderson Cooper I'm Brian ... a these are just ... Jim Acosta\nThey are so blatantly attack dogs and um then also at the at the very head you have Jeff Zucker who's not an on air talent but he\nClearly is going about his plan of antagonizing and opposing President Trump at every level so I was ... identify\nAs somebody you know there was involved in the media obviously and it's always a come or you know the conversation is going on I don't know why you have any GQ that gentleman's quarterly columnist\nOn your panel to discuss something like the the shooting in Pittsburgh and and the job of Donald Trump is doing I'm not really sure why you would be you know why she will you know another\nReporter said gee you are just so on top of pilots well that's what\nThat's what I mean so I I'm not sure exactly unless you have to make a you know outrageous comment but if you are someone in the media whether you have a liberal bent or not he would seems to me you still want to have credibility and I think what what the problem is is that at times it's so over the top\nOr as you point out the ratings are down I think it's really in part because the credibility is down and uh and and the only thing that someone in the media has whether it's the talk show host journalists punted on television the only thing we really have is our credibility\nWhen CNN's there's a lot and have it right so why would you why would you ... you you sacrifice that just because you don't like Donald Trump\nActually why okay they had a very different view of what their role is [noise] they they don't think their role is to be objective reporters of the news you see this permeate or you know this Doug you've seen this permeating schools have quote journalism out their Columbia University\nAre the worst University of Missouri school of journalism a and and they just create a a a generation of reporters who who think it's their objective to make the world better and they make the world better\nBy reporting anything bad\nAbout conservatives that that's their whole modus operandi\nKind of like Don limitation on CNN I don't have the exact quote but at the media died kind of got a story on it about the looming you know having a conversation\nMy

violence based off of our ZIP Code but the all violence as equal\nAll right here we go again five fifty is our time is that they're a little kid yeah from the okay\nWell that is David dog so if it was a high school graduated from high school in Parkland, Florida was involved in the a tragic shootings there and I'm the guy just won't shut up\nAnd he he knows nothing about the constitution or the second amendment Everytime you turn around eight he's they're pitching gun control\nYeah I mean I think he had an analogy the other day and southern I saw where uh you know he was trying to say that the argument was it that we want to guns for every person not the\nNot just one of the the uh the I think the whole thing is is how the media just bonds over him right I mean what we've got a young person who wants to be involved in politics\n... is a moron\nRight [laughter] I I Know that's unusual or but here's the thing that are either [laughter] well I mean\nLike you said though uninformed certainly is a you know ah hind the buffet of the day I guess right I mean it's a ... of course gun control is is and he's probably got this from what uh maybe as family maybe television or whatever it gun control is perhaps the\nOne of the most uh uh debated issues or without facts are that they'd come about from some people here are the most\nTo kill us ask this of course came up because of the a murder of the uh eleven\nPeople in a Pittsburgh on Saturday at a Jewish synagogue and the argument made by the left and this uninformed young man\nUp is that uh well where you take away all the guns and there will be no no murders all of this nature\nThe the common sense approach is a no let's make sure we have armed guards at every church in synagogue and when a nut case shows up who wants to kill people or the armed guards shoot back\nYeah of course the the forget that the person that's going to commit the crimes probably go shoot them first ah but\nYeah just that's just a maybe a overstated right I mean ... that's their argument is that uh we need armed guards but I guess my question is why do you need armed guards it or we take away weapons from every one or use it as being that may be a criminal may actually get a gun\nAnd I was saying because of course you're going to abide by the law a bright exact right these are these these would be all legally acquired guns or that would be used now I think in that case I are in the Pittsburgh synagogue\nA I think these were legally acquired guns but um if guns were made illegal or law abiding citizens would not have guns but criminals obviously would\n[noise] and that has been the really the whole argument idle yesterday we were talking about the can you legally carry you know in a in a church synagogue kind of thing and and I was trying to find out if there was a definitive answer\nSome states she can dumps they've okay I can hear in tennis ... because we have good common sense right you're going to buy just as an

another\nRadical right wing in our a member and you never see it in our a member engaged in these kinds of a gun crimes are and and the left I guess wants us to predict the future they want us to mind read and determined to what we should've saw guns to somebody who who later uses them\nIllegally because the the the real protection we have for our society has to read people's minds and determine what they're gonna do years after they purchase of goods\nRight there in the constitution\nThe mind reading I think it's the Fourth Amendment time\nYeah oh yeah it's the thirty fit the men [laughter] you know that one that hasn't been passed yet\nYeah one of one of those where they wanna they wanna come grab the gods and I was thinking I was listening to what you and dug talking earlier this morning that the same ... the ones who want to deny us our Second Amendment rights that um the thing that's going to be the way to secure our communities make us safer\nUh we we have you know gun bans in place illegally unconstitutional gun bans in places like well Chicago Washington DC working out really well there\nChicago had forty five shootings over the weekend five fatalities just over the but\nWe have to have a gun ban how are they are shooting so\nIt's amazing there there are those who happen to be called criminals in our society I don't think that's that's one of those words we can't use on can't use it little can we use that now they can still use criminals are there are criminals\nWho break the law are you kidding me yeah it's like when you put up one of those gun free zones Johns in front of your mall your church or what does that really mean it means come here and shoot people because nobody's going to shoot back unless of course they're not obeying the uh the the law by bringing their weapon in to protect themselves and their\nFamilies because they realized we aren't I've long believed that if we really want to start dealing with the with these these companies these businesses the post the no guns allowed science\nJust pass a law that says that's fine but you are then undertaking the obligation to protect everybody in that facility\nAnd not just in the facility but walking to and from your facility if I'm if I'm robbed at gunpoint if I'm shot by a by some offender outside on the street as I'm walking towards your restaurant because I had to leave my gun in my car\nYou you ought to be liable you ought to have a responsibility to not only protect me inside your facility absolutely but also\nComing in and out of your facility because I'm being put at risk by not being able to unless you got to have like in the Old West recon like check your gun you know like you a check on totally at the at the restaurant the bobbitt you just you checked your gun you checked your coach so so that coming to and from the restaurant you're safe but then you have to check it in there\nBut I think if we would make a law that says if if you are shot killed injured\nIn a restaurant in a in a facility at a movie theater anywhere else where we have quote banned guns that's fine but but then the owner is liable for any damages the come because they fail to have an armed guard they're protecting anybody the other thing that struck me as I was listening to you guys talking as as I was driving in is um if we banned guns\nThat that will stop gun crime the same way that banning drugs is completely stop drug you that really has has completely eliminated and nobody uses drugs we don't have any illegal drug problems in this country because what we banned drugs and and wouldn't it be nice if we just like band\nShooting people murdering people with guns then I tell you this land already if we just banned you're shooting murdering people that there are laws against it yeah but you know it works just as well as\nAs a as banning guns has in in these varieties of of places anyway the gang members don't wait in the end they're gonna try to stir this up

Carolyn peppers and said this person I Want you to issue an arrest warrant against this person for resisting arrest disorderly conduct\nThis is a race get treated differently in the in the court system with African American judges and and judicial commissioners than a white person will be treated in this particular\nIt's really a question of you know does the district attorney or a believer in the application of the real law this message\nPaid for by mark green for Congress eighty lowers their share their frustration about how much tax they pay\nLet me reverse that for you and put the emphasis on saving taxes this check out our founder of the hidden wealth solution and I've been helping clients for over two decades to get their retirement on track and avoid the tax traps\nDaily I see clients paying taxes needlessly instead of maximizing their financial future learn how to save unnecessary tax in optimize your retirement visit retirement protected dot com retirement protect the dot com\n[noise] Raasch Hannity on Fox News talk radio tiny eight forty three and Fifteen to end\nNow back to the Tennessee Starr Report steam Gail and Michael Patrick Leahy how 'bout that\nHappened\nI think you know the fact that at one of the things that whole wherever they launched his presidential run on a ... radicalization or oh I think it has radicalized so many more people than I have all the way he talks the wasteful waste\nIs that says it it's a way the way\nThat whole ah allows for ... for ... I Know I'm not ... the way that he has had high like little ... not congressional football and creating whole cloth kinda has signed a pack of ... but then you know\nAnd I think the pushback\nThat you're about that yeah you got a CNN claiming that the Trump is more radical than ISIS and they wonder why nobody gives them any credibility they they wonder why people chant CNN sucks maybe it's because well because sucks that can be part of it uh yeah the uh\nUh the the left a continuing to just blather on and claim that a President Trump is has radicalized more people than ISIS really at that\nIt doesn't seem even remotely accurate and yet very little pushback from the left\nWing media now there is a CNN a commentator has now apologized Julia Ioffe has apologized after claiming that are dropping radicalized more people than ISIS this was on the lead with Jake Tapper and uh she's now she's now a backing off a little bit a little bit\nUh in in her in her outrageous comments but again that's that's the thing these the left is just you know run amok\nIn terms of of running their mouths like a a a kid with a really bad case of diarrhea by the way that these stories do tend to to come together in a way that this is strange there is something bizarre going on Michael because\nYou've got stories that seemed to be a two opposite ends or different ends of the spectrum and then they intersect in ways that you can't you can't imagine and just make you scratch your head and go I didn't see that coming first of all you've got the\nThe radical mob that are disrupted the Marsha Blackburn rally on Sunday and you've got this Justin Jones' character\nWho has has had a history of this kind of bizarre demented ... and it's got away with and gotten away with it and and apparently will do so unless the district attorney and the and the and the general sessions judges in Nashville Davidson county step up and say we're not going to have a racial disparity in the way we handle\nSimilar cases if you resist arrest in a violent way with a police officer you're going to be charged with resisting arrest even\nEven if you're black\nAnd the judicial commissioner is black even under those circumstances we're going to enforce the law without regard to race color creed ethnicity or political affiliation we're going to enforce the law is what national they should\nDo the other element that you have going on here is failure of the judiciary here in Nashville to support the police\nWell then again the general sessions judges appoint the judicial commissioner the ones that you have a night court they they appoint them they can remove them and the general sessions judges need to step up and review this case to determine whether or not again there is an isolated incidents\nOf this African American judicial commissioner showing favoritism towards African American defendants brought before\nHer or whether this is a pattern which again would justify the U.S attorney stepping in and pursuing civil rights violations against Davidson county and the judicial system in Davidson county I mean this is the tip of the iceberg and if you're going to Tennessee star dot com\nSince he started dot com you'll find that not only is this an example of the judicial system in Nashville\nNot respecting our police officers but also perhaps a bigger situation of a civil rights violation of a disparity of treatment by the courts in Nashville based upon whether you're white or black we hear so much about black lives matter do white defendants matter\nIn Davidson county or not seven three seven nine five to two seven three seven W. L. A. C. can anybody imagine again go to Tennessee star dot com look at these pictures can you imagine if you're a white defendant\nFighting with a police officer white black Asian or Hispanic police officer in the same way Justin Jones did\nAnd not being charged with resisting arrest or is this do we all have a get out of jail free card the none issued by David county that I could go in front of police officer in the same way and I know I can drop in Davidson county court and that I'm going to get a get out of free jails out card\nHere's what I like listening to do when they go to Tennessee starting to come and read the story they just look at these pictures of Justin's Jones resisting arrest and then it's just an assaulting other people at the ... yes yes just just just replace Justin Jones with I don't know Steve deal\nAnd say was Steve gal in those pictures ... woods Steve gale have been charged with resisting arrest\nAnd if and if this defendant\nIs not guilty or even a subject to being charged with disorderly conduct\nThan they need to throw out every disorderly conduct case that has been brought before Davidson county judges in the last year and going forward if this isn't disorderly conduct they shouldn't prosecute any body ever for disorderly conduct in as\nAs they ... you see ... you can see it there and play pictures also this video support says well\nEvery defense lawyer in the international law to be pulling this story and going into court and then to appellate courts if necessary to get the real judges to figure out whether or not any any defended can be prosecuted for resisting arrest or disorderly conduct in Nashville based upon the precedent that this is setting if\nThey don't like having like sander than I think\nIt it clearly sets a standard where where where this behavior is acceptable if you're the right race and it's the same race as a judicial\nAre wondering if there are lots they're running a lot of hope\nFor wherever you are or how ... not a gift of life dot\nOrg and get a free from here at home or find a donor drive in your area for the you can ... ... with a family member of that term but it can get from one hour around\nHow long will it take you to get from four forty and Murfreesboro time saver and traffic immediately after Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than doubling you well I think\nNow more the tennis star reform and Michael answering laid\nWeb where you can see the stories we're talking about including the or the refusal of the judicial system in Davidson county to prosecute the\nOr the young man who disrupted violently disrupted the Marsha Blackburn rally or even though the police officer asked for warrants to be issued for a just a disorderly conduct for resisting arrest and you can see the pictures it's it's not even a close case I mean\nShouldn't shouldn't be a tough one to win that one if a if you're a prosecutor or if it would be prosecuted because there has to be like an indictment or an arrest warrant issued first and then I'm a criminal ... past that you can treat either as a criminal act or just issue a citation kind of like if I Walk across your lawn without your permission\nSo how does this work how does a judicial commissioner instruct a police officer not to file a church\nBut they're refusing to the issue the arrest warrant I mean that the police officer brings and says I Need a warrant for this arrest and the judicial commissioner says nah\nHe looks so nice to me I I just can't believe that since he looks like me that I I Can't believe he would that would have committed a crime and therefore he gets a get out of jail free pass\nWell is it he looks like me or he thinks like me\nProbably a combination yeah yeah yeah and and again if he was a conservative African American he probably wouldn't have gotten the same treatment again but I think it's the double whammy that he's a liberal activist African American going before a liberal activist judicial commissioner who also happens to be African American and Davidson county that apparently is how\nJustices dispense where they big blue thumb being put on the scales\nAnd so what what does that portend for the potential to civilian oversight board of place\nI think you're going to see exactly the problems that people like James small with the president the F ... are bringing out that amendment one will exacerbate the problem will amplify the problem of of police not being treated with respect and David some guy you're going to see blue flight\nAs they might say that you're going to see police officers even not wanting to be part of the national police department they're not not going to want to stay with the national police department because you're going to have activist like this Dustin Jones guy sitting and second guessing police officers a kid that shows no respect for the police because when he was instructed to leave a facility where he should not be\nA after he's been disruptive he refuses police instruction\nAnd then resist arrest assaults not only the officer but uh but people in in proximity is he was kicking and flailing as as one of the other women did as well who was also just charged with a um Thai tastes like ... for criminal ... rather than actually being\nCharged there is there are more increase his recent example of members of the Nashville judiciary disrespecting the national police department than this\nAgain I don't I don't pay that much attention to to what the courts in Nashville doing because you've seen Nashville move further and further left how are you going to recruit businesses to come in and locate in Nashville Davidson county when they know the rule of law may or may not be treated fairly towards them as a company as a corporation has Nashville\nWill move further and further to the left you're going to see the hollowing out the anti business higher taxes as\nA result that you've seen in Detroit that you've seen in Chicago that you've seen in inner city Washington DC that you've seen in Oakland that you've seen in all these all these communities around the country where you put this same flight path in place it's kinda like if you're if you're flying an airplane and and your engines go out\nYou're gonna crash it's just a matter of where and Nashville's got a crash it's just a matter of when because the flight path has already been clearly determined and and this is just another example is just a as they might say another breaking the wall of where Nashville is heading thanks to the liberal activists leadership that dismisses the rule of law\nThat dismisses respect for police officers for enforcing the law the same way that that in embracing a sanctuary city embracing the fact that what you are\nIn terms of being Hispanic or or or a third world country I'm a immigrant that that matters more than the rule of law that if you come into our country illegally\nThat because you're an ethnicity that we want to try to try to get more votes from it the polls that were going to put that ethnicity ahead of the rule of law at is what is separated America\nFrom other countries it's what has made America dare I say great\nBecause the rule of law is what separates us from these third world countries were bribery where corruption where well it's who you know not what you've done it's it's what you are not what you've done that dictates how you get treated under the judicial system and what we've seen in these other countries where\nWhere the rule of law doesn't matter there's a collapse of authority there's a collapse of of the uh the structure\nThat America has that is why people are trying to come here despite the left telling us how awful how bad we are how race we are you've got these people streaming towards our border\nBecause they believe things are better here than where they're coming from because\nNate Silver one of those are predictors one those
