we're not so good and at some point it it ended up not to be quite as entertaining\nDonald Trump is always entertaining\nYou're right yeah the mixture of individuals they are a lot of them a previously and not even been involved in politics and a ... and such but I think well Trump of course comes from the background of a you know being in the media for all these many years reality television doing TV interviews or\nIt being in the public spotlight in New York City so he's got sort of that um you know their background and he's kind of refined that let ability and and uh like I said even for people who\nHave not been big fans of Donald Trump there's a there's a compelling element about him or when he's on stage now there was a um [noise] I Wish I had I didn't didn't print that out but there was a story on friday um [noise] about how the president has instructed his dad\nHave to get him a more available a and B the interviews other than the Fox news channel and also the uh\nUh of these rallies but yeah we now the mid term elections at that he needs to be more more out there um and and so we're seeing that right I mean the the with the Leslie stall it'd be last night it's been somewhat unusual for the president to go somewhere other than Fox and he's been stepping\nUp the commitment comparing throughout our local neighborhood we care for our home armed ...

I don't know hasn't told me that I Want her relationship with him it could be that he is I think it's sort of a Democrat if he wanted another [laughter]\nLike General Mattis has a good guy\nWho we get along very well may leave I mean at some point everybody everybody\nLeaves anyway the president last night on sixty minutes Leslie saw interview or just one of the uh the many questions of she was asking him last night the general Mattis what maybe his future there's a lot of thought and talk or Michael about I once the midterm elections is over there maybe some of the big changes in the cabinet\nAnd everything and I guess we'll see right I mean it's a ... do you think it's gonna be based on the outcome maybe some of these um you know mid term elections if the Republicans do well it'll be one way and maybe if they don't do well to be another way what do you think\nYou know I think that whole questioning about a defense secretary Mattis is is sort of a much ado about nothing um I I think that the CBS or sixty minutes folks I Know this will shock you\n[laughter] we're trying to lay a trap for President Trump and trying to um make him look like and\nUh he doesn't know what he's doing I think that that was that the marriage issue is um I I I I don't see him as likely to leave up but I Would agree with you on this I think a President Trump has a strategy he's he's a very tactical guy\nIn other words he's not going to do anything between now and the midterms except\nGet out of out he's going to do these rallies everywhere it every competitive congressional district he's going to do rally if he can and you know there's twenty two more days he's going to be in a he's probably going to do two or three these day he did he get to all who knows\nUh but I Do think ah regardless of the outcome\nThere will be changes on the day after the midterm elections um if the Republicans hold the house\nUm they're predicting that the Democrats will win the house but guess what they also predicted a on the day before the election of a president in two thousand sixteen [laughter] but yeah I mean I'd rather\nPick it I'd rather be get a bill games it's easier you know I mean it\nYeah well they both they predict politics a landslide electoral college victory for Hillary Clinton [noise]\nYeah I mean that's what I'm saying I mean it's it's and I told you just ... you know jokingly that I thought if people always ask me what do you think's going to happen well first of all I never know because that's just the way things turned out to the mind of various voters plus we play voting really led\nA at the uh the ballot box a lot of people do they they don't follow things like you and I do they don't pay as close attention a lot of people after the working and paying taxes they get\nYou know kids playing sports and they're not quite as engaged all the time and so sometimes they they don't know and and it causes a you know some surprises I Would ask this question though is it better if the Republicans hold the Senate or is it better to hold the house of representatives I guess I Would have always\nYou know a hill to the opinion it's better to hold the house then the Senate um but I don't know what do you think I mean that that it does turn out the way Charlie Cook and ... are saying\nWell I mean the if you just look at the numbers um everything that the map\nFavors Republicans in the Senate they currently you hold the majority of their by fifty one forty nine I think it is actually in this particular instance it is far better for the Republicans do hold the Senate ah than the house if you had to pick and the reason is\nA Supreme Court nominations\nOr who knows if another Supreme Court justice will retire [noise]\nUh but if they do a ... you'll see another constitutional loose constitutional originalists nominated and confirmed by President Trump ... by the Senate and this will be a dramatic significant change\nAh and the composition of the Supreme Court and move the Supreme Court toward Jay consistently originalist viewpoint which I think is you know tremendous down\nThe house matters because all you know taxation a and revenue a bills most originate in the house but let's face it I mean if the Democrats are were to win the house it's going to be just nonstop investigation investigation it's gonna be Spartacus on steroids\nRight and that's why I was thinking of the house would be you know it'd be better to have a house which is sort of the you know the the element of Congress of the people but I Do uh I certainly take

Michael aimed or\nYou know there you go I mean the the Democrats from outside or ah you know I'm trying to help rather simple this thing off\n[noise] it's an interesting story because as you know the sad that three campaign workers were captured on video saying\nUh you know a a Phil Bredesen was really not telling the truth when he said that he would have voted for the Kavanaugh confirmations a spokesperson for the Democratic party celebrating their mark brown who's got a history of a lot of vulgar comments\nCame out and said oh no those just were you know unpaid I'm\nA interns and turned out a Fox Seventeen\nDead at at at investigation of this following up on some of our porch Harriet was a great reporter I had this to say friday night\nFox anything investigation we did ask mark brown person for the Democratic party turns out he wasn't exactly telling the truth he dealt with in that video her entire volunteer\nHave documents have something that they are actually have a staff of the party day I brought that to my ...\nChanging his story dog and and here is is how we change the story\nIn this email ... Democratic Party spokesman mark brown referred to those in the video as intolerant and said they volunteer knocking on doors and making calls but Fox Seventy news investigation reveals that's not true according to the federal election commission those talking in the video are paid staffers for the state party\nChair young intern\nAnna\nMaria Hi back in ...\nOh yeah yeah and and and again I thought we were attempting to mislead anyone [laughter]\n\nWe wanted to trying to mislead anyone uh we just uh we're talking among ourselves Michael we were just saying that well you know a governor brothers and says one thing openly and he said something else privately I mean we were just talking among ourselves we were\nTrying to mislead anyone and then you know well you know those free those trees a paid staffers by the tendency Democratic Party\nThey uh uh I wasn't talking about the people who were actually talking on the video are we talking about the people in the background they were probably the Internet's good grief\n[laughter] so but as soon as this\nIs that is that really the the argument though I mean is that really the the the way you put it out to the public that well these people they yeah I mean they really weren't members of our campaign just because they were talking about uh you know whether this was done to deceive about the Kavanaugh\nA physician and that kind of thing that uh that doesn't really matter right I mean these are low level Stafford types\nWell really matter we did some digging on this and we found that there are sixty one reticent this or lead story at the tendency star dot com or this morning\nThere are sixty one reticent campaign workers who have been hired after Chuck Schumer's control group the ah the group's any controls what are the groups he controls the Democratic senatorial campaign committee\nUnfairly Mr President I'm here I'm going to you very rarely you're sure sure your Leslie sure yeah [laughter] that's funny hey that's the only regret I got out of the really big about him I regret if you're not really mean barely [laughter]\nYou know I think part of part of the Trump appeal is is just so entertaining oh no doubt\nI remember telling people right when he first started I said look the guys the entertaining you know the Mexico what is it I'm going to build the ball in Mexico going to pay for it now juggler every time I heard that okay you can get into the reality of who's going to be wide and whether we'll build a wallet and everything but the point is it was a winning\nA sort of argument because a lot of people like yeah we need to do something about people coming here illegally but there's something compelling about listening to this and then um I think it was one of the debates\nMichael when somebody said something made was Jeb Bush or whatever who was sort of moderating you know the position and and he said the or maybe they quoted to the Mexican president or something I don't remember exactly the details but I remember his answer was like okay we're going to build a ten feet higher ah you know I did it was going to be [laughter]\nWell you know then I said look there is entertaining a value to him that and this is a and we cannot underestimate you know a ... that the entertainment the uh uh the fact that he was so well known by people you know the I I don't want to call just totally celebrities sort of aspect but there is some of that\nWell he's entertaining oh he's very hard working and actually ah we're going to be interviewing 'em in six at the six Fifteen a segment we're going to be interviewing a another fellow who is very entertaining and very hard working in fact one of President Trump's favorite interviewers Brian kill me\nThe zeal and Michael\nAnd\nGood boarding everybody a terrific Monday it's a little went out here in Nashville so be careful driving as you come along Michael Patrick Leahy with Steve deal here this morning and we're going to start off with a more entertainment

free\nJail sentence thirty five years not\nAgain\nAnd he is on American\nSoil [noise]\nSteve I'm the Donald Trump in Richmond, Kentucky uh last night [laughter] or Saturday Night a was added again and of course he had a big victory to announce a pastor Brunson released a I guess he's just winning\nYou're just winning constantly when you get pastor Brunson released a you've got continued progress in South Korea\nJust day after day as as he was joking I think in Richmond, Kentucky targeted all of his rallies kind of look the same but as he was joking enrichment duct tape and say look governor Bevin is going to come to me Mitch McConnell is going to come to me they were going to beg me to stop the winning and I'm going to say no guys know we're gonna keep winning\nVote Democrat is if you're tired of wedding\n[laughter] they love that don't you I Do it it is that you you were talking in the last in the last\nHour that that that entertainment capability that he has the ability to to communicate I think\nIs is a different styles communicating obviously but I think she may be a better communicator in terms of knowing how to reach voters didn't even Ronald Reagan again it as a dramatically different style Ronald Reagan was known as the great communicator\nBut instinctively Donald Trump knows how to coin a phrase I mean look at what he did with ... hats mainly Iran too great again hat on with with make America great again red hat\nOr your for a little while just shovels his own hair and the make America great hatch or one of the iconic political symbols of American history\nWell you know you talked about are reaching out and making Republicans confident or as Ronald Reagan did\nHe kind of pitch that again last night about how great Republicans were or Saturday

on all the France I mean you look at the polls illegal immigration is still at the top of the ticket the Democrats are making their move against guns they're starting to come out of their shell and talk about what they what they will really do if they get power and and while they're trying to avoid accountability for their candidates are saying\nThey're mainly saying what they will stop not what they will do they mean they're trying to push\nTo gain control the Senate to gain control the house and yet all their talk is how much they hate Trump how much violence they won in our streets how they how they want to push an civility and how they want to impeach bread jumping up and up each President Trump I don't think those are winning issues you\nKnow and you see the the utter chaos going on in Portland, Oregon as one example of a a really the unattractive elements of the mob of the Democrats and you know politically you know we've got twenty two days until the mid term I I don't think
