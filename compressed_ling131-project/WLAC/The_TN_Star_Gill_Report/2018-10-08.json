is Monday morning it's an official federal holiday [noise] although the left doesn't want you to know how long does day you remember that\nGuy Christopher Columbus the guy that supposedly discovered the new world right into is now I guess fallen out of favor I mean it's amazing all these historical figures write him\nA they kind of gone by the wayside with people wanting to take statues of Christopher Columbus down cities I think they think they're more cities in America named after Columbus than any other single\nI think even more than George Washington has things named after him the city of Columbus ohio\nHas decided not to Donner Christopher Columbus are going to have business as usual do they good I'm Glad to see government operating we don't need any more holidays right\nAnd so um what is it all about white Europeans coming to pillage and raped the new world that's a kind of ah the way it ah the way is now sort of described to us and here we are with the city is named after Christopher Columbus now used to at least they would stand up [noise] you know for Columbus Day activities Italian Americans\nConsider Columbus as a hero but uh not anymore right and I was asking the question earlier I think Michael was juggling about it but it seems to me Columbus is the ultimate\nAh illegal immigrants right you're landed here uninvited why does the left and I like him [noise]\nHe came here to better life isn't that what we hear all the time of why are in this whole issue about immigration that we should get a look the other way [noise] but ah [noise]\nAh it's another reputation down the tubes here I Wonder how many more historical figures were taking Confederate symbols down you know around the country and all of that it's just amazing or what's going on and the culture war that's been happening for a while in this country and and how a\nSort of these traditional a historical figures or maybe it was kind of like the capital of the situation right we just a minute we just we just mere people today are really don't have any sort of intellectual discussion about any of these things right I mean there's you know good and bad about American history I don't have a problem a kind of looking at these things have you\nNot at all not at all I I Wonder if they're going to name um Columbus or indigenous people yes indigenous ... people Ohio [laughter]\nWhere do you think well that did not if you really hated right change the name you know they're trying to say today they issued a statement\nYesterday they're going to honor veterans and I'm all for that obviously I'm In a major I went to the Braves game last night which is why you know it's a a this is very very early for me this morning and uh the uh you know they had a guy there he was like for all harbor and then he was a D\nDay he was at the battle of the bulge my gosh she's still based you know it looked pretty good he had to be near a hundred years old and so there I mean and they honored him at the ball game last night and that's great and such and I'm all for that but you're right change the name of your city of you really think that Christopher Columbus was it really this bad guy right\n[noise] did you um did you watch\nOn Saturday dug the conduct of the protesters in the Senate gallery\nWell I'm sure they were well behaved they ah they minded they're matters [laughter]\nWell let's let's slit his test out and see how they behaved\nQuestion all posts cloture time has expired [noise] the question is on the nomination\n\nIs there a sufficient second [noise]\nSergeant at arm's whoever you ... ever thought about serving as well they weren't that very well or they have now what was interesting Doug I thought after that is after the vote did you see what they did with a cent West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin who\nVoted yes did you get it landed with we went in and shook his hand right into the highly let's see how they shook his hand okay\n[noise]\n\nNothing like a little democracy at work right I mean you know here's the thing about all this and of course they've been despicable I mean uh you know they've they've not been the following Mitch McConnell when he went to the airport obviously Jeff Flake or going up and down elevators and I have a right to protest but when you really sort of start to becoming\nI guess is a it's almost like civil disobedience but it's taken to the level right I mean you're now interfering you know with the process here and um yeah I mean it's\nA it's probably only beginning right I mean Joe mansion they'll probably follow him around\nAnd then uh you know we still got just what a few weeks before the midterm elections here I was going to ask you because we don't run out of time with the you know my a segment on the show but uh I was going to get your thoughts on do you think this is going to affect the election obscene several sort of stories and editorials but it's usually by sort of the\nThe left wing mainstream media that uh they thought it was going to matter but I don't I'm I'm Wondering do you think of this does energize maybe Republican voters I was asked that several times this weekend [noise]\nWell I I Know what I think let me what do you think I'll tell you but I Want\nTo hear your idea at first you mean do I think it's it's going to make a difference yeah yeah I think it's good because I really think that\nAh the Republican base was so sort of dormant going into this midterm uh election or that the um [noise] that you know that they're like well\nYou know it's a yeah things are going pretty good in this and that and we're hearing a much from them but I think this Kavanaugh nomination in the way that the things went down to fact so many people watch it yeah I think it might actually energize the the conservative element here I think the lab was already energize myself\nI I actually I completely agree with your dog I I think that the the Democrats have so overplayed their hands\nThat they're now is a reaction from Republicans who look at this and say and conservatives who say well what about the rule of law now the Democrats are so\nThe only info probably for the American Heart Association face the basket\nProblem around him ... pretty common market a little\nAfter ... ... ...\n... when my mom went wrong when I'm middle around ... farm

critics right away it was\nThe stores pay Fifteen dollars an hour 'cause they they want McDonalds and\nIt'd be you know hey where we're at we're at full employment now and so uh you know that that last go down from three point seven percent a three point six percent that must be George Soros paying all these protesters don't you think that you well I'm\nKinda glad the Democrats the liberals are actually working now um we were happy to hear that have been wondering about that for a long time now so ah\nBut yeah I got him die huh yeah he's the only thing that there's only one thing a liberal can do for a job these days be a community organizer that's what they're trained\nWell in their president sort of a you know live the way on that right I never knew what that was until Obama got to be president ... based genuinely organizer I mean that's the way there was a block party down at the end of the well\nWe saw community organizers on full display in the Senate gallery [laughter] in the Senate gallery a pro life was like this ...\nYeah I thought it was somebody the titans were playing the way they were they react you know I mean seriously though are people really are are they going to get tired of this\nI think so I think I really really that ... is America\nReally that bad right that are that are going to have people screaming at you right I mean the everywhere you go just because we have some disagreements about some political things right I mean it it it is it really that's what we're getting to know\n[noise] well you know ... ... if you watch it is very interesting where we're going to come back in the six o'clock\nHour when a steep hill joined just we're gonna talk about how Donald Trump is handled is in a typical you know you have that rally in Topeka, Kansas a victory lap Saturday nothing\nTrump I mean he was in full form but he pointed at one point said he made was you know the the the two hundred is so protesters outside the Supreme Court\nA while the vote was going on wouldn't even fill the front row of that auditorium where he had more than ten thousand people show up and like there were ten thousand people waiting outside\nYou know and we I think you and I were Jenny about this earlier a ... a few days ago that President Trump did go out into board is nominate\nAnd one of the things that I thought Obama although I didn't want the judge Garland getting burned by any means and and was glad that that he didn't make it to the uh the Supreme Court I thought it was odd\nThat the President Obama really never went out and campaign for his guy right I mean he simply just sort of okay well the Republicans are going to hold this up so nothing's gonna happen exactly ... ... yeah I think we have to really give a you know Trump credit for the fact that\nYou know the ... there was going on with this nomination it in such that uh the Trump went out and really campaigned and made maybe they they may have turned the tide right maybe that's why Susan Collins maybe ah ah but you know a ... voted the way she did perhaps I don't know me and made a difference in all of this\nWell I think you're exactly right Trump as a fighter and what's happened the unexpected things that have happened the change in the paradigm\nGoing on in the political world now is you see because the leftist so out of control and unfair and their attacks on Kavanaugh we now have a leader in Donald Trump who is strongly supportive of his guys\nAnd who has United the populist Tea Party side of the Republican Party with the establishment side and that really acting as\nBut Lindsay is going to help you in these red to blue states where there are Democrats running for reelection and were somebody like Lindsey Graham can say look I've worked with this person has a friend in the past but no more because they've lost their way the Democratic party has lost its way\nAnd and cheers and we're going to talk about this a lot today\nTrump voters are not Republicans now a lot of Republicans voted for Trump but Trump voters those people that turned out that haven't been voting in recent years they're not Republicans and as we've talked about here Michael for ... for the last several weeks as I've been talking about for months\nIf you don't turn out the Trump voters Republicans will lose the midterms\nAnd those folks turnout when Donald Trump's on the ballot they've they've turned out when she's on the ballot not when Republicans are running this has made this election a Trump election this is motivated the Trump voters who do not show up in the polls just like they didn't uh two thousand sixteen because they're not typical voters they're not regular voters so I think\nI think this is going to have a bigger bumped it's not even showing up in the polls at\nThis point Well Donald Trump was out in Kansas Saturday Night taking a victory lap and he was making a pitch to those Trump voters I think we have\nAre he won't fall Trump code he was pointing out that you know look at these crazy people why put them in charge\nDon't match is doing arson is and you don't\nTo an angry left wing ma and that's what\n... they're getting riled up and

L. A. C. seven three seven nine\nFive to to recover the live from my music row and I I Know Michael thanks as well Maine pointing out that stuff Taylor Swift voice is is is one of the worst on music Roman she she cannot Jerry attuned she cannot sing and Kee ah without the\nThe technological advances in the audio tuning that is available that can make ... literally can make anybody sound like a singer she's not somebody who can go to a\nA in the round performance at the blue bird and just seeing with their voice and and again you're not going to see the phone line finding out what people are music row who have who have handled the concerts potatoes but now there's a bunch of other she's not the only one\nThere are plenty of other big stars in country music and she's now more pop music more catering to the lesbian gay transgender crowd in New York and in California but there are plenty of them they can't carry a tune but a bunch of them are are not sticking their head up trying to claim that now they're they're political expert\nLet let's give her some credit though let's give it the credit ... she has been an awful lot of money she's a ... huge success she's beautiful she's a great performer\nAbsolutely but she's not a singer well she also you know she owns a two million dollar condo here in Nashville eight twenty million dollar condo in Tribeca\nNeighborhood in New York City you know where Robert De Niro ... yeah yeah she's up their liberty row she moved there in two thousand fourteen\nApparently she moved back but she still owns\nThat twenty million dollar condos she voted New York when she was up there that's a good question\nI Wonder where she where do you think she pays taxes\nYou see I'm I'm believing that she probably always claimed to Tennessee as her residence even when she was living in New York and possibly voting in New York because\nThanks to Marsha Blackburn [laughter]\nAnd and a few others the killer bees Marsha Blackburn Diane Black may beavers Steve but Gil because of the killer bees we don't have a state income tax and Tennessee they have\nNot only a state income tax in New York on top of their exorbitant sales taxes they also have local taxes ... just piled them up and on you I guarantee you if we got the tax returns of Taylor Swift\nShe would have saved millions of dollars thanks to Marsha Blackburn and instead she smears Marsha Blackburn in her endorsement\nOf Tennessee Senate Democrats Phil Bredesen or ... and in the course of her ... read against Marcia she claims that that she's against Marshall because Marshall voted to deny women equal pay in the workplace I hate to break it that Taylor Swift but you know we've had laws on the books for a long time probably since before she was born\nFor equal pay\nFor equal work in the same job now what you get is just you know women get paid Seventy eight cents per per dollar for men are the reason you see that disparity is not that a woman and a man doing the same job in a workplace are being paid a disparate amount a different about\nIf if you are a woman and that is happening to you call your lawyer today that will be an easy win\nIf you're in the same job description same job title doing the same job as a man and you're being paid less than a man\nAnd you've been there the same amount of time there's no additional seniority you're you're in the same classification doing the same job and you're being paid less because he's a man and you're a woman call your lawyer today that's like the easiest when out there\nBut what they talk about is that

also pointed out during the rally the the two hundred or so\nUh I guess protesters that were screaming and pitching uh his event or\nIn the gallery at the at the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh wouldn't fill up the first two rows of one of those rallies and as he points out you know tens of thousands of people are turning out to these Trump rallies is\nIs the Republican base motivated and will that motivation and enthusiasm has been created in the cabinet battle state in play\nNow through November are getting early voting starts is already started in some places around the country it starts in Tennessee in about a week\nWill that will that enthusiasm Gerry Ford and as we've pointed out will be\nTrump voters who are not necessarily Republican voters be motivated that

battleground states and he's going to be accompanied soon by Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham saying he's going to break protocol and go actually campaign against his fellow senators Democratic senators who voted against Kavanaugh in these key\nStates that Donald Trump carried by double digits\nAnd and that there are moving in the Republican direction I mean you've seen some recent polls Claire McCaskill in Missouri running for reelection in a state that Donald Trump carried by double digits she's dropped to about an eight point deficit in her race for reelection Jon Tester in Montana\nOr a few points down their Heidi Heitkamp dropping to more than ten points down in her race for reelection in North Dakota as again Republicans are moving in the right direction in these battleground states and then CBS poll has a new poll out this is Marsha Blackburn leading by eight\nJust for the fun of it ... just for the fun of it you know in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren is up for reelection ... I'd love to see Lindsey Graham go into Massachusetts and Donald Trump actually at this rally in Kansas last night uh really blasted Elizabeth Warren did\nThey yeah they pretend to be an focal haunt us ... also got some attention oh\nThis Boca [noise]\nIndian blood in me that Pocahontas and I\nYou you you can't make up his uh his entertainment capabilities up by the way\nThe polls I don't think ... is the Donald Trump voters move into getting enthused when we saw on two thousand sixteen as you had these Trump voters that aren't necessarily Republicans that aren't being polled that haven't been politically active\nTurning out and voting for Donald Trump you also saw Democrats blue collar Democrats in places like Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania voting for the Republican nominee in part because Hillary Clinton didn't go there although\nIf they had taken a closer look at Hillary maybe they wouldn't have voted for it she showed up\nBut the bottom line is the Trump voters are not people who are on the role to be cold\nAnd and you see an under polling of Trump voters say things happening and some of these other countries down in Brazil a far right congressman former army captain\nBoth NATO was running for president do the polls and the predictions in the political experts were saying oh he was going to was going to fall well short of the fifty percent needed in Brazil to win the Brazilian presidential election\nShe nearly got the fifty percent to avoid a run off the second place finisher is about thirty points behind him you have a Trump light candidate in Brazil\nWho may be winning their you've seen it in Italy you're seeing it in in Europe\nThe Trump like we're not gonna take it anymore we're not going to tolerate the illegal immigration anymore those those voters are playing a role in every election around the world and I think again we're going to see those Trump voters turn out with more enthusiasm than we had just a few short weeks ago\nI think you're right the question Steve and all I think you're right Steve and I think the question is this a will there's also translate into the house races you know if you look at it right now the the pundits say that the Democrats are going to take back what do you think\nI think the maps bad for the Republicans took traditionally historically when you've got a twenty three twenty four seat margin you you're gonna lose thirty thirty five seats which would give Nancy Pelosi the gamble would give the Democrats a eight to ten point margin in the house out of four hundred and thirty five members of Congress\nI still think that's where it head I don't think they get a blue wave I don't think they get a massive run I Do think they ended up taking the house but I I think the activities the antics that the ... that we've seen from the far left or their their protest or turning off voters\nBut a lot of the seats are up for grabs because Republican", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The TN Star Gill Report", "city": "Nashville", "day": "08"}
