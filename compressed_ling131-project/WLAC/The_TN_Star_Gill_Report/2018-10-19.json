only Eighteen\nOr days away kind of similar to what the view and I were thinking uh yesterday or might lose we discuss all of us that we think or it'll be closed but we think the the Republicans will hold on a even though the prediction I guess with what they always call it the conventional wisdom which I don't know what that is who's conventional anyway\nBut the uh the idea that the Dems will when the the house um but uh you know he he thinks that can be again in the Senate which I didn't think was somewhat a maybe a surprise but it it's certainly possible evening when you look at some of the races out there\nWho knew Rush Limbaugh was listening to us on the tennis early edition yesterday\nHe wants to be right [laughter] Russia's right\nAh [laughter] that's true though I mean uh but I mean we're just the ... what are we basing it I you know you had a really good conversation with Steve yesterday about\nUh the Fox news poll that came out yesterday morning we didn't talk about it you know when I was an angel Paul yeah okay I thought it was the ... but the ah Vanderbilt okay that you wish me I'm Sorry yeah but you were talking about how Democrats were so over sampled in this\n... yeah basically if you ever listen to the news and you hear a Vanderbilt poll reports just think I have a Democrat over sample poll reports [laughter]\nThat's all you need to know you need to know a ... a\nBig said well actually just about every poll out there you know it's a you know it's kind of we believe in them then we don't believe them in a you know I guess if it turns out the way we wanted to maybe we're happy with them but I think it is interesting and everybody's got a gas or about the mid term elections here but um you know it's like Newt Gingrich said on a\nOn one of the

started Michael Patrick Leahy with you this morning alive and local here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten WINZ the program started by each morning last ... the bill will be joining the show right after six o'clock\nOr to stand by or for that are less um [noise] let's continue our discussion now about the\nReally the the mid term elections Eighteen days away and a Senator Lindsey Graham I I'm shocked that I it's unreal out of my mouth that Lindsey Graham is actually saying things I agree with but he seems to be leading the charge he certainly did and the Kavanaugh\nNomination I I'm just wondering if my world was upside down\nIt is down and it's still there yeah your city in Tennessee near you let\nLet's listen to see what's going on with Lindsey Graham here\nThat's what I Want every democratic candidate for the Senate to be asked Tamara\nAgree with Diane Feinstein if Democrats take control of the Senate or you for reopening the Kavanaugh investigation or you are far more humiliation degrading treatment of this fine man are you far containing this debacle\nThey agree with Diane Feinstein if you get in charge of the Senate Democrats you're going to go after Kavanaugh again I think every voter and all these Trump states that have Democratic senators needs to ask that question are you with Diane or not\nYou know I posted a number of chosen a station in South Carolina and the Lindsay was always sort of wishy washy\nA Republican to a lot of listeners and everything I'm trying to figure out what's going on that John McCain let him out of his kennel a before his passing what ... what is happening here this is he's exactly right a hundred percent correct and what's going on or if you vote a Democrat in the upcoming election here\nAbsolutely and of course that question that he posed is a question that the Tennessee stars posed to fill breast and we asked them the same question [laughter] ah\nI guess what Phil responded to us [noise]\nI'm just I Can't wait what what did the bill rather than have\nThis they must listen to what he had to say what Phil Bredesen said when he asked him a when we asked him do you agree with Senator Dianne Feinstein the idea of reopening an investigation of judge Kavanaugh\n\nYes that is when you heard of his job rather than you ever feel ... who said\nHe was would vote to confirm Kavanaugh if you were in the Senate but of course is staffers said on video now he's lying about that what\nWould they rather do do you think they'd rather investigate cabinet or try to I guess impeach him in some way and get him off the court over there ready to just uh have hearings and impeach Donald Trump which one would be their fate\nHennessy where he won the answer that question Doug is\nBoth [laughter]\nWell I mean there's only so much time right or\nThe owners here yeah well you make a very good point Doug there's only so much time and all the house of representatives will be doing the only thing that will be doing\nYeah that's true and you know one of my one of my friends who is wanting this out the dummy over and over again he's like you know we gotta get the boat that we got\nThis has got to happen because uh the Democrats are going to do nothing but investigated for the next two years well that that is correct I think Joe Biden and some of the others are saying don't even ... they they they they would rather have a wounded Donald Trump ... running for reelection then they would really uh you know energizing\nA trumps borders and in a way to withdraw a kind of like what happened with the cabinet situation there's there was this overall coalition of the sort of the Republican coalition I guess you could call it\nThat uh you know they've got some different opinions about uh the way things are going but they were in total agreement when it came to what was happening to cabinet show same thing would happen to Trump I think if they go after this impeachment stuff especially the mother report is pretty a week\nOn anything about the president whatsoever then there would be nothing for them to really impeach him about\nAbsolutely well you know Nancy Pelosi had a few comments on that so uh well let's see what Nancy Pelosi had to say\nThat ... so we're going to put our fingers on the chalk board but go ahead [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nOne of the\nNatural [laughter]\nSo there you go down the ... is this this\nIs not an agenda though right I mean it's like okay we're going to lead illegals do whatever they want we're going to a really impeach are we going to investigate every Republican we can and Donald Trump's cabinet but that's an agenda\n[noise] well it's the uh we're going to do nothing but attack Donald Trump's agenda and of course you know Nancy Pelosi\nOh my goodness where do we begin first she really losing it I think mentally you know she referred to the ... amendment several times and in that little ... it's not an amendment it's a it's a special counsel investigation\nAnd the other part about that I thought was very interesting she she said essentially so we're going to go after the truth what's the translation of that dog I think what the translation is let's just set speculate that after the midterms when this report coming out let's say it's not it's not terrible for the president\nI'm sure you would have wanted to be proven wrong but the first thing you'd have this past that\nMatter I think you can ... ... it's only in time but it can get someone else around here\nThat are you looking for a way to get back to your community Hi\nI'm Stephanie and I'm like my license or actor for safe haven came I ... we're the only time I felt there and now and I think that's how my family as an entire you know I've\nOnly tears are the backbone of our organization over twenty six hundred volunteers donated their time to help fix even amazing eighty four percent success rate if he went back to the kind of volunteer\n... says that safe haven dot org today\nBecause break lights suck all time favorite traffic coming up on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than double the ... the head of the Starr Report\nEarly edition with Doug Kelly and Michael Patrick Leahy [noise]\nHere ... years ago President Trump was here and he made some way this last year you write like Paul Ryan he's a boy scout and that's fine but lumbering\nScary you want to buy things again right [laughter] he wanted an Indian woman [noise] I don't want to warn failed her DNA has it\nIs a former U.S ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley speaking last night at the Al Smith dinner capitalizing on a really sort of the [laughter]\nThe ... story of beer that is a little bit more in in her Native American heritage or lack of it\nUm as we continue here welcome back tendency star before the early edition or Steve yellow joined the program right after the news at six o'clock I'm Doug jealous along with the c._e._o. and editor in chief of the Tennessee star Michael Patrick Leahy\nHere as we continue the discussion or Michael you know the um [noise] uh everyone the sort of a kind of is is getting in on the ah Elizabeth Warren joking a thing right I mean she the punch line of all time right now\nOr I think she is and and but for her to the the horrible things about it for her is ... this is all her own doing\nRight right did it to herself shot herself fail but why didn't narrow it how do you fail a DNA test that's pretty good actually uh\nAnd then uh I Can't remember the former congressman buddy he's one of those are now in Fox News channel is sort of a Jason Chaffetz right did you see the uh the photo he tweeted yesterday was he okay he's when he's at Disneyland\nAnd he says I'm here he's got he's next to wouldn't India and he says I'm here with Elizabeth Warren at Disneyland [laughter] he's so mean [laughter] that was terrible actually All right the Supreme Court justice\nJohn Roberts is wanting everyone what to play nice is that right yup civility needs civility in this country that's what we may let's listen to see what Justice Roberts has to say\nThose of us on the court know\nThat the best way to do our job is to work together\nIn a college away\nI'm not talking about mirror civility\nAlthough that helps\nI Am in ... talking about a shared commitment to a genuine exchange of ideas and views through each step of the decision process\nWe need to know each step\nThat we are in this together\nWhat do you make of that I mean it's like when we we ever had that I mean the Republicans tried to play nice but then the Democrats slams down on the uh you know a on the carpet right\nIt's rare for the chief justice to make such a statement in public and my guess is he's trying to do two things he's trying to basically publicly tell the Democrats just stop pushing the idea of de legitimize the Supreme Court has summer one\nNumber two I think that's also a message to Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd uh Atlanta Kagan and a Justice Sotomayor or to try and work with uh what is now the conservative majority in the court that includes a newly a confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh\nInteresting so the I mean so he's anticipating perhaps some animosity behind\nAren't you speculate you know I have a John Roberts story personal John Roberts story I don't think I've ever told you this stuff\nBut um I met John Roberts once and this was back in a long time is up forty five years ago it was in the fall of Nineteen Seventy three picture this\nI'm a ... you know young Eighteen year old kid from upstate New York a destined to just just got into Harvard and I think you know gonna gonna change the world\nSo I arrive in and I stay in the in in first\nTurnout will be huge or that people will just vote early and and have a bigger turn out I mean obviously we're gonna have a bigger turnout than we had the last two ... a governor cycles because there\nThere wasn't anybody running I mean you had the last time Bill Haslam basically running unopposed so there wasn't a big turnout to Senate races same thing or the primaries have been where the battle has has taken place\nAnd and this time you've got a credible candidates in in Phil Bredesen and Karl Dean challenging credible Republican candidates for change and you've you've got more turnout more enthusiasm again I think we'll see a big burst right out of the blocks\nAnd and then I think it'll kind of modify moderate during the middle phase of early voting and then pop up the last several days which is what we typically see keep in mind also that are like in Davidson county for example they have\nSeveral satellite voting places set up that there weren't available in the past typically you've had to go to the first few weeks of early voting two to one location or one or two limited locations in the same things through and some of these other counties across the\nThe state where you've got multiple locations where they have expanded to make it easier for people to vote early and as a result it's easier for people to go find the voting place if you're in Nashville for example and you live in Bellevue you know driving all the way downtown to to cast your vote at the at the county office building doesn't\nDoesn't make it very easy when they've set up you know ten or eleven satellite locations more people turn out to vote that's that's why they ought to be having the satellite locations\nSo I think the the the electoral officials apparently are falling to two roles are of the tendency star the first two rules one make it easy to do make it hard\nAnd it's it it produces results just like it does for us on Newt Gingrich has endorsed Marsha Blackburn for the U.S Senate we saw the kinds of Lisa rice has endorsed Marsha Blackburn for the U.S Senate John Rich a country music star Jon rich apprentice winner by the way a a few years back has endorsed Marsha Blackburn so she's\nShe's lining up a lot of the endorsements you know Phil Bredesen isn't going to bring his endorses the town I don't think he's going to bring Kamala Harris don't think he's going to bring a dining Dick Blumenthal don't don't think you're going to seek Cory Booker coming\nSenior home care the Supreme Court has closely divided our right to vote on the ballot [noise] they'll grow out of them will capture Martin Dianne Feinstein will destroy like [noise] they ... the Supreme Court overturned the right to keep a gun or\nLook at McGill reticence important [noise] I'm In a line from firearm transfers between lifelong friends and family members living law abiding gun on the bottom [noise] too radical for all we\nEntering the W.

I. Lacey [noise] and now back to the Tennessee sorrow born with the tail and Mike Lee [noise]\nMarket back in this is the tendency star board I've see bill Michael Patrick Leahy here as well you can join us on the phone lines at seven three seven nine five due to the uh the focus on Saudi Arabia the the murder of the Washington Post\nJournalist so gee who was killed in the Saudi embassy in Turkey in Istanbul is a captivating a lot of attention you've got Mike Pompeo the secretary of state who went to um\nTo Saudi Arabia to to meet with representatives of the royal family but then it spent time in turkey has reportedly listened\nTo the audio tape of the of the torture and brutal murder of his so gee which is interesting because that Newt Gingrich speaking during his interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News last night said that the technology is not day or whatever they're claiming which is that they they pulled this from his apple watch that you know it either be Bluetooth which\nDidn't happen it it would have been that he had his you know watch basically on the phone call didn't happen I mean it's just new pointed out the technology of what is being claimed of how they have this tape isn't how they have whatever tape they have if they have a tape\nWhat did happen [laughter] years you have\nKind of like the United states and others do spying going on and they've got listening devices either playing or did they got a uh lifting technology that penetrates walls where you can hear what's going on in these embassies we may very well in U.S intelligence capability\nHave audio of exactly what happened in that are in that NBC the Turks clearly we're we're focused on what the Saudis are doing inside their embassy but they ... this apple watch story that that that is out there Newt Gingrich pretty much just completely slept that down\nThe other thing too is yet he was being reported is he was killed\nA and then dismembered ... now and then dumped in the woods yet\nBut here's the question um if that were the case and there were a recording of it how would you know that specifically was what happening with I mean what do you say oh you're you're cutting me you're killing me perhaps maybe I don't know\nMargin maybe max where I think you and I disagree with that\nBut the Democrat crazies far out number of the Republican crazy so with their with their majority you're going to see\nMore than the Democrats would want you to see a mass of Maxine Waters of Sheila Jackson Lee of Alexandria or gives you a court has who's apparently who's phrasing always includes the words I'm like yeah for sure for sure because you're valley girl Congress person\n[laughter] well uh I I think that uh I agree with Rush Limbaugh on this I I think that the Republicans will hold the house my current production would be a that the Republicans will end up I think my guess I I'm not even would call it a protection\nIt's a best guess at best guess estimate is that after the election the Republicans will have a five seat margin to twenty\nAnd the the Democrats will have to Fifteen seats which is not really that much to work with a Mike I it sounds like you probably think can be a little bit flip you flip it and it's and again let's get a coin and flip the coin\nThat's about where we are right now when it comes in the house\nAnd the battleground races that are currently underway are all close and they're going to be I think ... affected and they've they've already been affected by the national climate you're you're seeing Donald Trump go in and do these rallies and and those are having an impact the the National Association of this race has had an impact\nBut I think what's going to happen in a lot of these races these these closely contested U.S House races\nLocal issues local mistakes by candidates in this case you know maybe you have a ... a better Republican candidate than than than expected beating a a a less good Democrat candidate and vice versa Donna Shalala down in Miami was expected that the former Clinton the secretary a cabinet secretary\nClinton Foundation president\nYeah she was she was supposed to just be an easy when she looks like she may lose a seat\nThat the Democrats were counting on winning in part because she's embraced the Fidel Castro Castro legacy in Cuba and it is still a strong anti Castro\nAnti ah Venezuela of all these expatriates that have moved out of those countries and embracing the socialism of Cuba the communism of Cuba socialism in Venezuela in playing well\nThat district by the way it's fifty six percent Latino and uh many speak primarily Spanish they're Donna Shalala speaks English only her challenger photogenic former Telemundo\nBroadcaster Maria Salazar is fluently bilingual she'll go into these districts and speak Spanish and Donna Shalala is just there you know with the translator it's not going very well the latest poll has sellers are up by two points and I think\n... are more ... on his own\nLittle Women were tomorrow but bread from the other way I'm putting political career first filled to ... them from from California from the parental ... come up with a couple

Fox News talk radio tiny eighth born three and Fifteen to end\nAnd now back to the Tennessee report with the bill and Mike Lee\nI'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border is uh [noise]\nAll\nImmigration onslaught\nBy the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or change the laws\nYeah President Trump in Montana blaming the caravan on the Democrats and rightly so what what makes you think that all the sudden out of the blue four thousand people a company by camera man\nWell organized with people handing out cash to them to uh to keep the care of and going it just suddenly pops up out of nowhere that four thousand people just three weeks before the midterm elections decide to make their rush to America\nIt's it is our organized it is contrived it just contrived as the doctor ... testimony was organized by the Democrats to smear Brett Kavanaugh I think it's got a backlash on them just as the Kavanaugh situation has but this was an orchestrated a bit by the Democrats to try and play into the sympathies of oh these poor unaccompanied minors and you look at these\nThese photos these are mainly working age military age males who are making the track northward and and you just uh I don't know if you saw the story yesterday\nThere was an adult apprehended at the border claiming to be an unaccompanied minor\nAnd these people don't have paperwork with them they're they're entering our country illegally it is a masked invasion\nAnd that what President Trump is wanting to put the military on the border to stop it Rosie o'donald saying what are you to send the military to the White House and take him out the this is sufficient and this is trees and by the way more of it from the left and as we were talking in the last segment if Republicans do keep the house grow their margin in the Senate\nYou'll see more violence you're going to see more irrational behavior more crazy talk from the left as if it couldn't get much worse than it already is is that\nIt's going to get worse Seventy there was a nine five to two seven three seven nine five to ... joined us on the phone lines uh yeah some of the Democrats and liberals are saying well there'll be there'll be a revolution if if the Russians steal this election like rape stole the last one I'm as as we constantly point out [noise] in a in an armed revolution\nWe got more kinds of you guys [laughter] bring it on burn is that you're next on the Tennessee started Portland Steve Dylan Michael Patrick Leahy good morning\nAmong them rein in morning like heroin and Bernadette\nNow

saver traffic immediately after Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen cents W well a theme and now back to the Tennessee ... with the bill and Mike lady [noise]\nLooking back in ... says the Tennessee star reports the deal micro Patrick Leahy here with you as I mentioned the Tennessee and doing a piece where Bredesen is trying to rewrite history about the income tax battles\nAre downplaying Marsha Blackburn rolling it claiming that well you know it wasn't going anywhere it wasn't necessary to to do all that chaos and and I lead I don't I don't just pound the table and scream and say no what what are you part of the Democratic party because that's all they do say oh\nWell let's let's let's get this straight that income tax was about an hour away from being passed repeatedly if Marsha Blackburn on a Saturday doesn't\nCall use Steve Gail and say hey let's get down here because they're ready to pass this today and if you don't go down there and if you don't set up your radio broadcast from the capital and if you don't bring in the horn huggers we wouldn't have an income tax in tendency today\nYeah the first couple of times that we went down when they were in says they were constantly moving moving the the the legislative process to try and avoid the horns honk or is it avoids the protest\n... and they had they had tried it kind of just in the standard procedure and we were down there we protested in stopped it and then they thought well in the middle of the summer when people are paying attention will do a sudden Saturday morning session\nAnd I'll never forget that at that time you Terry Hopkins and I were down there\nAnd and it was like a ghost town I mean it was like those old westerns where there's a tumble read blowing down the middle of the street where out there and and one of the Democratic operatives one of these little up millions ... the former speaker navy was driving the driving force with is along with Republican governors son was\nNot come walking up looks up and down the street looks less and goes into big crowd well we put the call out and on a Saturday people came down and enough of them scared the legislature ended up trying to take an action then then they started trying to do it\nAfter hours figuring oh okay well wouldn't feel Valentine and Steve Geller off the air then we can slip it in and by the way feel Valentine it ever on different stations\nAnd yet we were coordinating and working together because it wasn't about radio it was about doing the right thing and it's amazing if you do the right thing all all boats rise and and\nSo it was like after hours and they thought oh well we'll be able to slip it in because there'll be off the air and I actually went on our sports talk station or our sports talk show and and started sending out the alarm bells and again we had several thousand people down there which is where they now claim well then they they had a riot and they threw a rock\nOr a brick through the governor's office window a while they never produced a rock\nBecause there wasn't a rock thrown through the window and to be technically honest\nThe glass was on the outside of the building somebody inside had broken the window now at the door if people were banging on the doors because they were shutting the people out the legislators we're going to go inside outside the view of the people and people were banging on the doors and banging on the door is one of the windows got cracked where you would enter the building\nBut nobody threw a brick or rock through Sundquist window and the glass was on the outside of the building which would not have happened if you through Iraq through the window but the Tennessee and Phil Bredesen\nNot surprisingly lying about it and by the way all the reporters writing about this for the Tennessee in and talking about it on other talk stations weren't even here so if you were there if you know what happened because you were one of the horn hunker is calling us this morning let's make sure they don't rewrite history and lie like Bill\nBryson has a track record of doing now he's trying to lie about the the tendency income tax battle in two thousand and two thousand one yeah I'm a little upset about it because I hate lying revisionist history and that's what Phil Bredesen and the Tennessean are\nNone of those reporters at the tendency in we're here then I don't think any of them came here until a bit like ten years after that at the at the earliest at ... they're not tennis events\nAnd Phil Bredesen wasn't out there trying to stop and speak up about the the income tax and how bad it would've been he didn't speak up he was hiding in the ... because he wanted it to happen just like his other fellow Democrats this was being pushed by the Democrats by Jimmy navy the house speaker\nBy the end and said we were the previous house speaker and previous governor had made a pass at trying to do it as well and then backed off because of the pressure against it but they had a perfect storm\nWhen they had a Republican governor who flipped after getting reelected literally weeks after getting reelected promising that he would oppose a state income tax that he would never do a state income tax\nDon ... was flipped and the Democrats had their path to victory because they line up with a Democrat then majority in the house and the state Senate they thought they could jam it through because they have a Republican who would give them some cover and the Republicans were going to use the Democrats to give them cover it was moving to passage\nAnd the only reason it stopped is because Tennessee taxpayers spoke up foreign honked and turned out to say no\nWell it wasn't Phil Bredesen an elected official here in Tennessee at that time and two thousand one day the mayor name was the mayor of\nNashville and so it wasn't a long drive to come just a couple of blocks to join the ...\nWas the one that did he did he come and was he on the radio with you and ... and ...\nHe didn't oppose it yeah he didn't publicly oppose and then when he came in you know he he uh after by the way he he came in\nAnd the Republicans under under Sundquist with the Democrats\nRaised the sales tax there wasn't an economic crisis when\nWhen still reticent finally came into office because they had passed one of the largest tax increases in sales tax increase rather than doing the income tax\nThat they wanted to impose they were going to lower the sales tax slightly put in an income tax and then we would have been like all these other states around the country that have both a state income tax and a high sales tax and we would never have gotten the income tax you know off our backs if they had gotten it in and you're looking at all these states that have these huge budget deficits that have\nPersonal property taxes state income taxes high state sales taxes as well they're the ones going bankrupt Tennessee is the one that's had hundred million two hundred million dollar\nA billion dollar two billion dollar surpluses without the income tax that we were told would would bankrupt our state if we didn't just take more money from Tennessee taxpayers we're thriving because we said no and Phil Bredesen and the Tennessee in and out trying to rewrite history and pretend that something else happened that it did\nFeel reticent had plenty of cash when he\nMore for half\nCombination of of boss hog and and Joseph Stalin made this this guy's been in power for ever up there and he was doing everything he could to push this through any course he had the the are good for public and governor Don ...\nWho was pushing this thing to who it turned against his base who had said I'm not going to the state of Tennessee there's that famous quote that that we\nThat you guys played over and over again we don't need an income tax and then he got into office and one eighty degree and pushed it as hard as he could and Jim in a few sitting up there at the speaker of the house pushing it also this thing would have absolutely gone through thousands of Tennessee and\nTurned out that they were absolutely against this and we know we've seen other states implemented in income tax it would have changed Tennessee\nI'm completely as a state it would have given us high taxes it would have given us there got bigger government\nWith the people of Tennessee came forward and with the help of Marsha Blackburn we stop this thing and it is absolutely an insult to our intelligence to now come up here and say oh this didn't have anything to do with it it had everything to do with it\nBeen cutting ham thanks for your ah your insights and and again Don sunkist became a pariah because of all of that you haven't seen him at anything else may ... was also there may again the Tennessean and Phil Bredesen now trying to rewrite history\nWell have our hair and everything that I got fired I remember how I started that when it came out I remember that they're actually held Valentine and I think it will remember how the white guy and asked what are you there and we don't need it an act\nI picked him a copy it back and he asked me to come on the radio guy at four o'clock and I can attack it brings ... on a Saturday I get a Saturday Night stay home\nAnd that kind of started out all round re start talking about the fear factor oh I remember when we tell her income tax and rape carrot you cannot protesters credit for\nAccurate way they're around we got to act on that you know 'cause I crave on line and get her hair and Creigh after that we don't and I hurt a health writer at ... at that who are down there I thought he had a man came back and kill a man\nThat he came into the area and a half\nA half when he came into office and on\nThey raise the sales tax in getting may keep in mind these are the same folks the same sort of folks who just raised our taxes you know a\nThree hundred million dollars a year on gasoline while we were sitting on a billion to two billion dollar surplus they will always come after more of our money and they were going to use the ... the income

Louisiana Lafayette big deal\nArkansas big deal now Missouri ... we kept him divide weapons or he's going to be just for this for this year so I'm the only team that they've actually there was any good early speculated me any good as a and M. and they only been a forty five to forty three so in my mind\nIf Tennessee ... can play a game that eat that eliminates running up the middle on first Dale running up the middle of the first day of I mean\nI I just the Tennessee has that opportunity to keep it within twenty eight do I believe\nNobody in their right mind would believe that Alabama will lose the averse to see an Auburn was another story and I listen to all these Tennessee fun talking about how to the sea is back on the right road to recovery with over ...\nUm you know it was a good when it I'm tickled to death to be there and my daughter's a recruiter for university and this is Rob I'm all about it but um I Do think this particular week it's home game fans would be crazy rain supposed to be there and now the weather good to have an effect on this but I'm taking the risk to see to get the no\nTwenty thirty thirty eight to Seventeen or something like that I think they'll run up\nSupport I don't think saving is going to embarrass coach I don't think is\nGoing to he's going to get embarrassed here I Know what that statistic is but I Do think Alabama will be to see but I think it'll be much better gave that everybody expects\nI I I Do agree that the tendency is on the right path they're not there yet though and the and the Auburn wind depended upon circus catches by receivers than in previous games couldn't get to a gym right in the numbers so they they got bailed out by some amazing catches by by fifty fifty balls and receivers and if they keep doing that\nThey can as you say rack up some points even on Alabama but but that's not a consistency you can count on is that does catches that they made against Auburn are going to be something you can count on every week\nThat is true and Alabama's a completely different football team you it'd be number one of the nation and not be as good as there there is there a Tennessee hasn't faced anybody quite like this but um\nYou know I Hope that she gets through this game and does lose critical players you know injuries that could end up or you know being a problem I I Do think to the sea is going to turn out to have", "show_name": "The TN Star Gill Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "19"}
