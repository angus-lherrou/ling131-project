Michael ... the fact that she's come out and um you know done on the record here because she's losing apparently at least if you look at some of the bowl numbers right in her race for reelection so ah what do you make of that\nWell gee is a good question first uh uh uh I don't know if she went and saw the\nRed the FBI report that all the Democrats want it we will have at seven Fifteen Chris bird the host of ... of a point of view and valley news live in Fargo North Dakota will be on at seven Fifteen am to give us\nThe reaction there in North Dakota we do know she is down down by twelve points in her reelection battle against Republican Kevin Cramer\nAnd that in that state by a sixty percent to twenty eight percent margin\nLikely voters in North Dakota one judge Kavanaugh confirmed so uh that's interesting I think you tell me what you think Doug\nI think she's auditioning now for her next job as a as a director of a George Soros is move on dot org I'm a director of communications or what do you think\nWell you know I don't know about that but a lot of times as we know when a a really both sides of the aisle and they they lose the election they show up in some other position a kind of rewarded I guess by the\nUh the party hierarchy so I'm sure we'll hear from or in some fashion if indeed she loses the election but you know the a ... to me it's kind of interesting that a again a she's more sticking with the\nThe Democrat leadership here and maybe this is a you know the way she really feels about the the cabinet combination I mean I guess that has to be put into the equation here but the\nThe other thing is um you know when you're in such a fight for reelection and you know you've got these overwhelming poll numbers like you're you're pulling out of your constituents out their overwhelming the other way\nUm you know it's a it's a it's unusual I guess to see someone really go against the law like that show\nA baby she sees that she's going to lose this election anyway and and would rather you know a kind of going along with your line of thinking maybe she's thinking okay well I get a better job in some fashion or you know in the Democrat the hierarchy if I go ahead and vote no here\nDoug the other interesting developments that uh people just tuning in may not have heard as if this drama couldn't have any more twists and turns you would think there is nothing new well guess what you would be wrong because here's the latest twist you're ready senator I like\nThis one because ah this is something different that we haven't heard a

interest in it there's a you know we've got the the\nThe potential nominee or about the nominee but the potential Supreme Court justice writing\nAn op ed in the wall Street Journal this morning a you also got Michael the former Supreme Court Justice Stevens saying Kavanaugh should not belong on the court so everyone that both sides sort of pulling out everything they have right on the eve of or perhaps this vote\nYes and one of one of the people really are pushing for his guy is Donald Trump that's what people like about a Donald Trump he he sticks by this guy and what I thought was interesting and he also does it at that rally a big crowd there as usual\nIn Minnesota we played that clip of people cheering there's also a lot of other stuff at that rally one of the things that I thought was interesting is how Trump went after Keith Ellison you know he's the congressman\nUh I you know we kind of went through the vote down I guess a little while ago but [noise]\nYou know our minds is going to be changed with any of the what we've seen is FBI report or anything I mean\nUh most of the Democrats you've not all of them you know we just mentioned is still one of those up in the air at this point right but uh you know most of them are going to vote against him no matter what simply an ideological reasons maybe some revenge factor really from the fact that the ... and call for a vote with the\nYou know with the Obama appointee and um you know maybe that some of it so we were kind of right in that as you said all along really about five different senators really that's going to make the decision on this right and ... it's even a little more narrow now isn't it\nAbsolutely well the outcome still hangs in the balance the good news is when we come back\nOn Monday morning Doug [laughter] we will be able to say exactly what the vote was and he will either had been confirmed or not there are four senators who are still undecided one Democrat Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd three Republicans Murkowski of Alaska Collins of Maine and flake of Arizona a there was an article in the hill last night that said those three Republicans are trying quote trying to get to yes and Doug ... my view is I think\nThe the the last argument against Kevin ... is this temperament issue and I think that is why he wrote his op ed in the wall Street Journal addressing the temperament question and his audience is those for undecided senators what do you think\nYeah I think that's exactly right I think are a much of what the ... and we started the program you know kind

a Facebook employees are all upset because one of their executives the vice president of Facebook and we know how social media is\nA come under scrutiny here for their role maybe in a recent elections and all of that but uh he he's a a close friend and Brett Kavanaugh's\nAnd um he was sitting behind Kevin Joel capital in the vice president for global public policy was there for his friend the two are friends they'd been friends for a long time\nAnd or the or Facebook or employees apparently had been outraged to the point that he has apologized for sitting\nYou know giving support of his friend at the Senate Judiciary committee the other day so I'm a tell us what that tells you everything you need to know about the rank and file members right at Facebook I just we knew it anyway because of where it's located but uh [laughter]\nSo he apologized for sitting there\nAnd that is crazy but of course you know actress ...

I guess I see some of the you know this back and forth as well but I mean uh [noise] it just seemed to me that there there's no room apparently to even be a friend\nOf a cabinet whatsoever right I mean and we don't even know if these allegations are true and we know that the FBI's report came back and concluded that there was no collaboration and all of this so therefore you have an accusation but do you have no evidence to back it up but in this country now\nOr were changing sort of our monitor I guess right now you're guilty until you're proven innocent and the fishermen allegation like this and I think that's damaging\nAbout this we're gonna have a a member of the U.S Supreme Court [noise] and it's happened before with Clarence Thomas but we're going to have\nA more than likely he will be confirmed and we will have a all of this sort of out there from now on to every decision that he makes the left or even though they would criticize him anyway we'll use this further to sort of beat him on the head or a doctor forward will become the liberal hero that Anita\nHill the game right you'll get all these uh speaking engagements what's he going to do with that million dollars to go beyond me out I think she'll she'll find vegan ice long vacation but she's not going to fly right Michel\nShe'll hang out with her beachfront somewhere you know you're talking about groupthink and in Silicon valley uh there's only one way to saying so far left way and Nancy Pelosi represents\nSan Francisco right in the heart in Silicon valley and let's see how fair and open minded she is about this process [noise]\nParents or the late ... peaceful hearing loss so little\nCowardly patriarchal that's what that's what these people are these these awful republic\nCancer are sexual for their life photos ... can you believe that I mean people are are you guys I we have to help it's really really for all you have to deal with salt mine got a gift of life narrow registry excelling\nAnyone can do at\nAre wondering if you're a lot's donating a lot easier than [noise]\nThan wherever you are going to have a flat ... got a gift of life dot org and get a free from your home or find a donor drive in your area for you can ... ... it's only a minimum of term but it can give someone else around the world\nThat home quicker we can help ... better of another traffic update in less than ten minutes on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten ...\nThe head of the Starr Report early edition with Doug ... and Michael Patrick Leahy [noise]\nAll right moving right along here Doug jealous along with Michael Patrick Leahy the editor in chief CEO of the Tennessee star a checkout Tennessee star dot com for your latest headlines and are you also can sign up for the daily headlines delivered to your email box by going to Tennessee started dot com and\nI get your news stories there and um you know we were talking about respect and the lack of it\nOr the instability that has occurred in the ... the country we've seen that with these protesters that were arrested yesterday and the U.S Senate and really just harassing members of the Senate at for example some of these soldiers are already on record that they're voting in favor of Kavanaugh\nNow that's not enough so there's a lot of this protesting is not really\nAbout changing the minds of individuals maybe in some cases like Senator Murkowski of Alaska where you had a bunch of Alaskan\nOr lawyers are uh you know a a campaigning to get her to devote knowing the cabinet combination that may be one thing but a lot of these protesters is really more or less about harassment is I see it Michael I mean it's a uh what else can you call it I think\n[noise] harassment and intimidation and a little bit of bravery is needed there by the way Doug ... have we heard what ... Phil Bredesen is this is going to do what he would do if he were in the Senate has he been allowed by Chuck Schumer to say anything about it\nNot that I have a bird but I I Know that you following this very closely would know the answer to this\nYear [laughter] well well well we've got our theme song for old Deborah Phil Bredesen about how he's handling this particular question it\nHe goes out that after they vote [laughter]\n[noise]\nOf our\n\nWell in that Kenny Rogers song in the end the coward of the county takes on the bullies but you know fill person I think you're right I think he'll announced what he would have done after the vote has taken Doug\nWell it takes a lot of courage to be an easy vote yes on the cabinet I'm an Asian and ... just doesn't want to say obviously\nHe's cowardly in this he won't say he's not a moderate he he cannot do anything you can't say anything on the campaign trail\nThat's not approved by Chuck Schumer from New York and of course you know a Mike Michael Bloomberg Mr gun control Michael Bloomberg the billionaire is ... who's is holding a fundraiser for Phil Bredesen up in New York City you know New York it's the state they're both from\nBut the Republicans and ah Marsha Blackburn are just hammering\nPhil Bredesen for his failure to say anything about what he actually would do if you were in the Senate do we have a couple of stories\nAre at the tendency star uh with the FBI report done on cabinet it's time for bread listened to speak up that's from the Republican National committee and then also we have another uh uh an ad from Blackburn [noise] the the Kevin\nSnowplow parents [noise] [noise]\nYeah that ... parents producing snowflake children and a man against some of these folks that are out there just screaming and that are just um incapable of of sharing anything you know reasonable uh that that even approaches civil debate or or any logical debate rational\nDebate factual debate it's it's all about emotion and I know we had a call yesterday Stephanie you don't get upset when I said look you're you know you're being driven by motion and this should be a factual discussion and she you know all your attacking women for being too emotional it's like no she had actually in the conversation said several times what she feels right field is where I feel that\nThat this isn't about feeling and and as we've talked before\nIt is it is tragic if your sister your mom or you have suffered a physical assault you had a boyfriend who slapped around a husband who beat you up or cheated on you a a a guy who sexually assaulted you or or God Forbid raped you at some point\nThose are all shameful horrible things for anyone to have gone through\nAnd and I think anybody with any sense of humanity and decency you know it's not all men are bad and therefore we don't care if that happens to women that we do care because you all are are sisters are mothers are our daughters and and it does matter to us but what matters also is that what happened to you or your sister mother a daughter\nWasn't done by Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd this this emotional transference of well this happened here so therefore I'm blaming Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely ... rational it is hysterical and then there's an emotional bender that that has no business in the public discourse and\nAnd and it is not a well women are too emotional but you're not seeing guys out shopping in the streets over this other than the the liberal hippy ... guys with demand bonds who are out there playing a political game\nYou know again it is tragic if anyone is is misused abused sexually assaulted raped or anything else but Brett Kavanaugh didn't do it and in this case he didn't even do\nWhat he was alleged to have done thirty six years ago by a woman who increasingly it is clear has lied and been orchestrated in part of a conspiracy to attack Brett Kavanaugh but I\nBut I digress we've talked a lot about sex so I didn't want to kind of twisted to at least one other different angle\nIn in San Antonio Texas or Michael they have a controversy looming because they strip club not a in a strip center ice a take off your clothes and

in you know in Davidson county you've had the\nThe the you know the Karl Dean Phil Bredesen Democrats are embracing this sort of thing and and unfortunately we've got some of the rhino some of the soft Republicans who who really don't want to get involved in kind of makes them a little uncomfortable to talk about saying what we're we're going to tell people that go into the bathroom where your gender tail ya\nDirects you and and I saw a great name Michael the other day that had had a picture of a of of two different women ... the first said I'm ... um it's it's okay to er it's it's outrageous to what to have been subjected allegedly to seeing a penis I'm\nThirty six years ago when you were in college it's enough to you know smearing around somebody's campaign but if it's got to be because the guy comes into the little girl's bathroom or lock room then that's okay the same people who were protesting on one side or the ones in bracing exactly what Ron pointed out saying oh yeah let's let's let's at these pervert guys go into little girls' bathrooms\nI'll tell you who was uncomfortable I'll tell you is uncomfortable that five year old girl who was assaulted by and I read the same story rounded and had the same exact reaction that Ron had by it was allegedly a quote gender fluid\nStudent at that same elementary school who was under their policies allowed to enter that bathroom and this and gender fluids student then assaulted the five year old girl my question to you is what recourse\nA do or Paris at in that case what recourse does that five year old ...\n... and and and this is not an unexpected consequences always sometimes we have\nLaws in legislation that leads to unintended consequences this is not even unexpected this has been a called shot I mean those of us who have been pointing out the idiocy of this go into whatever bathroom you feel like that that we can't make people you have to have to go to the biological norms\nWhen they go that that somehow we're the crazy ones were letting this this quote transgender business that has to be point oh one percent of the population if you look at legitimately not people who were just trying to push a gay lesbian transgender\nAgenda that this is not a big issue\nIt's just common site is it is being pushed by those who have a big political issue that they're wanting to drive home and and grind home and this is this is not unexpected it is exactly what we thought were like Babe Ruth point into the into the third deck salmon I hit it there we told you what was going to happen it is happening and hopefully it will get more attention than we can force lawmakers to react\nWhat could possibly go wrong if you let boys go into girls' bathrooms or\nLet let boys and girls gone camping trips together and the Girl Scouts Boy Scouts were going to merge them together yeah let's let's send hormone driven girls and boys because again part of this Brett Kavanaugh things were going back thirty six years\nOr any of us that have sons or daughters that are in high school age or have been high school age the last few years\nNo that the gender approach has been different\nYou know girls are texting insects being naked pictures of themselves to young boys that didn't happen well first of all it didn't happen because we didn't have cell phones but it didn't happen twenty or Thirty years ago women were not\nAs aggressive as we're seeing with this over sexual ... society that is pushing a girls to have to identify for themselves as as as also being sexually acted the same way that boys many times in the locker room talk when over talk what they were doing because to be a real guy I got a man yeah I I did Mary Jo\n... mostly it didn't happen\nBut you're seeing an over sexual lie society produced over sexuality at younger and younger ages and then were surprised by the consequences we shouldn't be the least bit surprised and it's time to start stepping up standing up manning up and warming up and saying this is broken\nIt closed as best in in his pocket so we got a toll free number Mr President eight hundred six eight nine five to if you want if you want our advice or if he called before I Would even get the here's what you do if Kavanaugh get their works relief today and the pain relief file at Walmart CBS Rite Aid in Walgreens pharmacies or their works relief dot com ...\nWill it take you to get from memory lane to Madison Time favorite traffic follows Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen then W well a theme\nTo the Tennessee sorrow born with the jail and Mike lazy [noise]\nLong walk\nBack and I'm Steve this is the tendency star reports joined us on the phone lines at seven three seven nine five to two that seven three seven W. L. A. C. you can also\nSinger comments via email Steve guild show edgy male dot com Michael Patrick Leahy edge email dot com go to our Facebook page Tennessee star be sure to like us and uh you'll catch up with the stories there and of course going to Tennessee star dot com where you'll find links to the stories that we talk about each day or one of the protesters team\nWas a again and this is this is what we're seeing with some of these protests folks that are extrapolating their own experiences or the experience of their family members and saying you don't care about\nWomen if you vote for Kevin ... well I can hear about women and recognize that uh you know Brett Kavanaugh didn't didn't rape some woman in in Idaho and and I can care about her experience and and care about her trauma but he didn't do it so why is she blaming him this is kind of what this protester claims\n[noise]\nDo you believe\nYou have\nI Believe that they are minors\nRight but in in individual cases some survivors may be telling the truth crystal men from was the alleged survivor of of a gang rape at Duke or across house with a why it was a complete absolute lie\nRolling Stone to the big story about an alleged gang rape at a at a fraternity at the University of Virginia it was a lie so if we're going to believe the survivors do we believe all the survivors\nAre just the ones that are telling the truth and how do we discern which ones are telling the truth and which ones aren't if we don't look the facts if we don't look the evidence and we might say that if you've suffered an extreme trauma current event the judicial system is there for you to prosecute bad guys help us do that\nDon't are somehow these false accusations to continue and and I'm a big believer\nThat if if if somebody makes a false accusation against somebody the penalty shouldn't just be oh they shouldn't have done that oh there's there's a heartfelt problem with that person they should suffer the same judicial punishment that the person they falsely accused would have faced\nIf they had faced justice based on that lie a so if you're a woman that makes a false claim of rape and you later re can't\nBreak gets proven that you lied you want to go to jail for the same amount of time the rapist would've gone you should be listed as a sexual offender if you're if you're going to play that game\nPeople are only going to consider what they're doing if there is a consequence it's the same way that judges are not prosecuting people for perjury people go into court all the time right now in lye\nProve all bleed lives we've seen that in this Kavanaugh hearing if you do not prosecute and punish people for perjury for lying under oath you get more of it if you prosecuted and make people pay a price for it they will think twice about doing it again\nYou know you are such an extreme as Steve obviously you are because you think that he you really seriously think that there ought to be corroborating evidence for an allegation an accusation I\nWho who who else would think like that oh I don't know let's go back to maybe you know a ... a a let's go back to Thomas Jefferson James Madison those those extremist things people that believe in the rule of\nLaw you know why the United states is successful than is different than the rest of the world why we've given a blueprint the rule of law matters is not the rule of who you know now again or their holes and loopholes in the system where sometimes a you know matters\nBut our system is built on the foundation of the rule of law will govern and when you look at some of these third world countries where there in abject poverty and there's so much corruption it's because they moved in a direction different from the rule of law and when they come to this country if you're going to violate our law coming in here legally work here legally\nUse identity identity fraud you cover up all your illegal behavior I don't think you're probably going to be somebody who embraces the rule of law and if the Democrats continue to embrace illegal behavior no wonder if they're moving away from the foundations of American Justice in the rule of law Nathan you're next on the Tennessee start report welcome in\nMy morning horn and [noise]\nI Can't remember\nJohn Paul Stevens [noise]\nYeah I got\nOne here\nThanks you're wearing a little bit difficult to hearing but I think he was asked about the uh Don Paul Stevens' kind of flip flopping and and attacking Kavanaugh yesterday\nAnd he didn't really hip hop because neither you or do you said he flip flop and and and I think you're paying attention or very close attention to Justice John Paul Stevens [noise] but you know John Paul Stevens is not exactly what you would call an originalist dizzy\nNow he was he was one of those we we thought we'd be better than he was kind of justices on the Supreme Court a disappointment to be kind and uh [noise] again you've got these justices now second guessing isn't it interesting though Nathan that while they're choosing\nBrett Kavanaugh of having the inappropriate temperament to serve on Supreme Court by politicizing things you've had Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd now John Paul Stevens a former justice do exactly what they're decrying there is politics on the court and it's coming from the left and what we were seeing with with the judge Kavanaugh was a political\nSmear campaign an orchestrated assault on him and his character that was all politically driven and and orchestrated by the left Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them\nAnd when he responds pointing that out\nHe's the bad guy it's it's crazy Nathan thank you for your call we appreciate you're listening or another\nWe're gonna talk about it the next to the next segment little bit more\nUm the crazy we're seeing in these protests the lunacy the the attacks the dock seeing and sending people to to these senators and congressmen homes are putting their families at risk you've got a ... a Rand Paul's wife saying she's not having to sleep with a gun right next door bed\nBecause of the fears that what what the Democrats in what the left are doing is putting she and her family at risk [noise]\nUm I Would just say what's taking just along having a gun next to your bed\nShe's from Kentucky what you know I'm not sure what's taking her late to get on the parade this is not just isolated to the Kavanaugh situation you're going to continue to see this crazy anti for kind of stuff\nPlaying out in bigger ways whole foods you can't get more Birkenstock

L. A. the\nMe and my\nBack and this is this tendency in our report on the bill Michael Patrick Leahy here as well seven three seven W L A seat at seven three seven Ninety\nFive twenty two if you want to do what joined us on the phone lines with your thoughts and comments about the news of the day I met you just before the break that whole foods is in a battle with begins at their Berkeley store where they had to get a restraining order against these activists who were marching to demand better treatment of of chickens and pigs that are\nWell sold\nAs meat yeah they're they're anti meat you don't come from my guns or my [laughter] it's just a warning I'm just warm in the liberal activists or I just wonder if any of these liberal activists that are protesting and\nAnd are demanding that that whole foods or provide more protection for chickens and pigs I Wonder if they've ever protesters are Planned Parenthood clinic and and and fought to preserve and protect these six hundred thousand\nUnborn babies um I Wonder if some of the feminist that are part of this you know recognize that half of those unborn babies are more women or would be women\nOr do the same folks that are here so much for chickens and pigs have even a shred of humanity and concern fragile babies\nThat might show up at play I guess would be no direct action it's [noise]\nAnyway just to another of the idiocy that we're seeing from the ... with left out the Kavanaugh confirmation process is coming to a conclusion coming to a ... a climax coming to\nA a an epiphany perhaps of of where people will recognize the reality of of what this is all about\nTomatoes Morrow we're going to have the vote here are just a couple of hours of whether or not they do cloture which means they vote on whether to vote I think they get that pretty pretty easily but do they get the votes for Kavanaugh does Kavanaugh get confirmed tomorrow Michael\nOn the record let's go on the record you and I\nRun the tape ... tape balls theory of this would be my unless unless we're wrong and the most rod and been accidentally\nDeleted the Eighteen minutes of Rosemary would tape and the next year\nWhere right this tape will play forever if I were wrong this tape will disappear no technical difficulties so I think here so I think it's going to play out uh I think he will be confirmed I think the vote the final\nVote will be fifty one yes forty eight no and senator Steve Gaines gets to stay at his daughter's reception in Montana and I think that right now Murkowski will be a yes\nFlake will be a yes Collins will be a yes and mentioned will be a yes that's that's my producers they run the table I think they run the table\nWhat do you think I think all four end up being yeses but I I think I think it's\nIt's wise to have the senator from Montana there because I don't trust\nI don't trust any of the four if if they looked me in the eye if they were walking into vote and said I'm all in for Kavanaugh\nI'd still want to see them push the button see the boat come to a close before I actually believe them because we've reached a justifiable lack of trust in this process and with our members of the Senate and the Congress there there are very few up there that I Would depend upon if they said with that certainly I'm going to do this\nThen I Would really believes them in these four who have been twisting in the wind and playing there there I I don't know what I'm gonna do games I I wouldn't trust any of them so I Would not\nLet the guy go to his daughter's wedding or I'd have a plane there and bringing back no matter what because I I wouldn't trust that they wouldn't\nAbuse the system at the last minute to play to play\nTo the ... so senator Steve Gaines as your insurance policy and you disagree with me you think that you you agree that he will be confirmed but you think the final vote will be fifty two yes forty eight no because if Steve Danes walks his daughter down the aisle sometime tomorrow in Montana\nGet him to go boxes he will walk and walk walk his daughter down the Ohio kind of kind of small slice off the back of the cake I let him take it with and\nKeep walking and there'll be a plane there and there'll be in the plane headed to Washington as a vote begins to leave the vote open until he arrived and if he's there anyway so you might as well boat right\nI think if he's there we get all four of them I think I think the problem is I wouldn't trust Murkowski in these people if he's not there to know oh All right I got a little bit more power I got a little bit more leverage\nHe needs to be there for the boat to make sure that they vote the way that they're saying they're going to vote which they must be telling the children are telling a McConnell and others that they're going to vote for him or they wouldn't be bringing it up\nBut here's what I ... I think there's a procedural thing you would do this better than I if if they get to the point where uh it's it's fifty for something goes crazy\nRight and it ends up being a you know fifty forty nine or ten some something different as as fifty forty nine against let's say\nHe's going to be in the plane but I think doesn't Mitch McConnell have an opportunity to extend the vote for a period of time until the plane lands\n... probably keep it and you shouldn't send standing in line for a cash at the\nFinding I Am twenty four seven dot com and the answer to get cash when you need it without the way\nPhone from a a twenty four seven dot com is not\nYou only pay for the money you need and only for the time you need it there's no long some pain that hit the cash you need and minute hey have twenty four seven dot com\nFrom your flak from here bank account\nFlexibility is good\nBy paid actors is a president Donald Trump cast the war will be continued advertisers stuffy or Seventy five not even close yesterday we tied a record in Ninety One today about Ninety eighty nine and isolated shower ...\nSo maybe you got some people standing up and actually showing some moral high ground is the last day\nOf course burg thank you so much for joining us here on\nIn our peak envoys list price dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms on what they mean it\n[noise]\nMarketable rape or cry when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's\nStill putting off a building that dream confusing\nWell and was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price he'll [noise]\n\n\n\nUses squeezes mayor\nFord terrifying attractions one location designed just to get paid\nFor the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive ... shows you what other people are paying for the home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan them right\nCall today and we'll start\nThis audio is for your review now for ...
