Bush and and I I can tell you having interviewed a President Trump on several occasions um\nIn person and over the phone I'm that\nHe ... he's a very intelligent guy who listens very carefully and and then you'll see him explain his logic\nNow he I mean now you can't turn on Fox News there's not some exclusive interview from the president he was on ... brain for twenty minutes the other night\nUh he's always on Fox and friends he was on Janine bureau but you listened to the guy and he said oh this guy he's not really an ideologue he sort of a problem solver\nWho listens to everybody and try to figure out solutions it's very interesting part about the guy I think people in America even some people who were not you know big Donald Trump fans are beginning to see that and I think you see that's why his approval ratings are moving up in the polls\nYeah I think that limit turned down my microphone a minute ago I think that's what I\nYeah I don't know you know we're we're ah where'd you heard the after the best that I said was after I you know live here\nI think the uh I think this whole idea of a criticizing Kanye West makes no sense by the laugh because again Eddie are met with President Obama they would have been fine with it right and so the the simply make these kind of damage when you want\nA let's say a case of Don Lemon who despises Donald Trump trumps made some comments about the unlimited and all of that\nAh when you want someone ah on that you consider to be on the other side of sort of politics or you know behavior whatever it is if you don't like about him when you want him are reaching out did you admire\nA and reach out to your side I mean it seems to me that's that's always what we're told right\nYou always let me pose this for your dogs yeah [laughter]\nDo you feel you start thinking about these things and they're just so many funny things had come up here is what what how do you think the the press would have reacted a if a President Trump had invited Taylor Swift to the White House\n[laughter] Taylor have gone that would be the yeah I mean that would have been a\nYou know they said well the president is trying to capitalize on the latest with popularity right you know there was a story I think political always one of those ah website anyway said that now that Taylor Swift has gone Democrat or openly on his uh she's selling more\nA more music and we know that you know I mean it's like the first thing I'm skeptical of that particular story but it's like okay now she's gone against Trump so therefore it's it's helping her career ... ... really need help in her career\nYeah I think he's worth like three hundred twenty million dollars and by the way congratulations Taylor Swift I Hope you keep making lots and lots of money [noise] uh but interestingly enough a I have an update for you on the Taylor Swift political participation this information\nShe's given more than Fifteen dollars\nTo get to that and just to say oh okay oh the big question uh that no one had an answer to was a well gosh is she even registered to vote\nTo go back in ... and the morality hire me if you don't have an open mind and the worst places open to everyone if you don't realize that America was when I heard about ... what can you do what can you do what can you do\nYou can remember that if more people can guess what people can do that matters\nNearly fifty million Americans have disabilities allies on their talents with employment practices that benefit everyone learned more at what can you do campaign dot org\nThat home quicker we can help map a better route another traffic update in less than ten minutes on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten ... the head of the Starr Report early edition with Doug Kelly and Michael Patrick Leahy [noise] but I Do at five\nFifty one no television Michael here's the deal joins that program right after the news at six o'clock this morning talk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen Dan W.

mornings at eight on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen than double the ... the [noise]\nNow back to the Tennessee report with the guilt and Mike Lee [noise]\nAnd looking back in the seasons are reporting the bill and Michael Patrick Leahy carrying you through the morning [noise]\nAlready had the early edition with the duct jealous Austin on the board to make sure we stay on track which is not an easy job I mean people don't sudden drawn track when the when we go off the rails more often than we are on the rails is not an easy job so thank you often\nOr as we call that five o'clock hour the steep guilt warmup show\nYou all don't pull a muscle memory you know we we hit it running at six AM so ... muscle if you don't warm up properly by the way as we sit here lived for you on the music row in Nashville music city ah it's appropriate dimension that Donald Trump yesterday signed the music modernization act\nPassing into law the landmark copyright informed that the national farmers have been battling to to have passed for a long time to give writers a bigger share a fair share of some of the digital a music from the other ways that the royalty laws have been here about fifty years behind the times and ... thanks to the Senator Lamar Alexander\nAnd a senator Doug college her house remember Doug Collins down in Georgia that they were able to bring the different interest groups the the record companies the artist the labels and and everybody else to bring them together and and get a deal done this is a big deal because it shows that Washington can can come together\nThat the swamp can come together and actually get some things done they passed opioid lessons legislation or just a week or so ago they've they've done this music modernization act while while all the attention\nIs focused on the frenzy and the ... and the anger and and the harshness of politics in Washington I think we have to give kudos to to Lamar Alexander as one of those who've been able to navigate the rocky shores\nAnd it actually get things done\nOr entertainment writer Bethany boom and did a terrific job on that story you know she follows entertainment generally show right about entertainment but here as we talked about earlier entertainment and politics connect and as you interviewed a Senator Alexander on several occasions you know he talks about the\nThe two tracks going on in Washington at the top level it's all the craziness and then at the level that people don't see as actually getting things done he likes to go when he says\nWhen when you can can do this a heck of a lot cheaper than what's been set up in this referendum so uh you're starting to see if you know on one side and so if if folks are looking at those go what what does that have to do with a again this civilian oversight is one of those things that make sense if you just asked people do you think civilian oversight of the police is a good idea\nOr yeah yeah that makes sense until you get into the details and the devil is always in the details Obamacare he got into the details and realize okay so we're going to charge people money if they can't afford health care\nWas just stupid we're going to push off the the payments of of the tax dollars actually funds is because we don't want to raise the taxes to fund Obamacare until we passed a couple of election cycles we don't want to raise people's taxes until it's already in place so that the whole scheme from the beginning\nWas ... was a um was a car on the same thing is true with this referendum is a con because it won't accomplish what they're claiming it will accomplish that will actually make things worse rather than better and and frankly again one of the things that people will I think pick up Michael on this show is\nIf if you do wrong we're going to pointed out if you do right we're going to give you credit documenting a Democrat on the Republican liberal conservative if you do the right thing\nWhere we're going to give your kudos if you do the wrong thing we're we're going to smack you it's it's like training a dog you your pet 'em when they do right you whack and with the newspaper when they do wrong and overtime a dog even learned he likes getting padded more than he likes getting whacked with a newspaper\nPoliticians are slower to learn but but let's give some kudos to bribe the if in fact he is going to speak out against this referendum tried to defeat this referendum so that he can do a better version then that will give him some credit for that\nIs there any indication that he will come out publicly in opposition to this referendum on\nHe's sipping his toe in the water right now um and again barring Birmingham actually going more all in ... he's going to play it both ways if it wins is going to go switch all along if I say that's what I wanted to happen or he is not a boat courageous\nUm transparent politician but to his credit he is he's not getting lucky over in the graveyard in an SUV that standpoint is in Berlin a step ahead of what we had a mayor Megan I'm\nLoving the good stuff berry who would get is making some moves that that those kind of [laughter] she's making her moves\nEverything you say anything anybody says about nagging Barry is just going to have that twist to it\nI was like that in our site that music I I got my thrill on Megan Barry hill her strawberry hit like he had ever I can never tell literary blueberry hill it was it was one of the other berries than anywhere they were getting their thrill in any of it she's starting to make the move maybe going to run for\nCouncil that large maybe run for Congress she she has no other focus in her life she has no other um capabilities other than politics which you know in my view if somebody is so eat up with politics that they have to have\nSigned it is the most pro veteran legislator in Tennessee by keeping promises to our veterans who sacrificed everything to protect our freedom\nIn Congress I'll continue to light and I'll stand with President Trump to build the wall\nAre dead and rebuild our military will always defend would I swore an oath to protect the freedom loving every American\nI'm Mark green and I approve this message paid for by mark green for Congress\nRaasch Hannity on Fox News talk radio Ninety eight forty three and Fifteen and\nAnd now back to the Tennessee ... with the jail and Mike Lee [noise]\nAsked the film reticent campaign theme song I wanted to add a third senator for the state of New York you've got Chuck Schumer who recruited Phil Bredesen to run for the U.S and if you've got just in general brand who's a big advocate of a a Phil Bredesen and uh I think a donor I think he donated her she donated\nShe wants to abolish ice by right and I think she's coming to Tennessee to yeah the ...\nYeah they got bringing those national Democrats that they're hoping that Phil\nPave the way for them to get into power in the U.S Senate and then then of course you've got the bill was born and raised in New York upstate New York yeah New Yorker and and has place still up there you know at least one yeah at least maybe more people forget that that a TV commercial we ran early showing a flag in front of his grandmother's house\nIt wasn't and Louis Berg [laughter] yeah New York\nThere was near Rochester New York which is you know not in Tennessee from what I'm told\nI kind of one of the uh the Republicans to do an ad that that actually took that house and then how did that that fly up pull back like a Google Map how far away it was from Tennessee of where that\nI can tell you how far away it is from Nashville is a long way it's a hundred miles I Know that because I drive up there about once a year to see my parents in Jamestown New York which is about a hundred miles south of where Phil grow up\nSo you and you don't like neighbors\nNeighbors good buds you know [noise] like with with those New York state values but now you then he moved to Massachusetts because New York was too conservative [laughter] yeah he and he ran for office in Massachusetts too but he was\n... I hate to say I mean again a particular in the wake of this whole uh the the campaign project their ties we're gonna talk about it's here's some more clipped at an update on what the Tennessee star has found out by the way to go to Tennessee star dot com you can read some details on that but uh it it just kind of strikes me is\nIt's sad that again to paraphrase what the what the British and campaign staffers were saying about how stupid ignorant as Tennessee voters are\nLook guys at least the Massachusetts voters were smart enough to say no to fill ... vote for it and of course we said no at first and then he piled his money and it was able to get elected the mayor and then and then the governor but but at least the Massachusetts folks were smart\nEnough to reject him he learns how to change his trajectory in terms of what he said in other words he uh he understood that finally he couldn't promote New York values he couldn't promote at least publicly prevented I'll do it after he got a leg right he couldn't promote Massachusetts values it ... then he learned\nNow be quiet about that and only do those things once you're in office that's his plan apparently according to his campaign workers caught on this project very tossed undercover video\nWhy do you think that uh and again maybe this is ridiculous question most of my questions are why do you think it is it the mainstream fake news media in Tennessee isn't covering not only this project carrot top story because as we talk yesterday\nNailing it as usual filled by this is going to ignore the project very top story he's got to know that he's going to get cover\nFrom his buddies in the fake news Tennessee in news room in Knoxville new setting them and Chattanooga Times free press and the rest and and the TV stations channel to channel Seventeen shit afford an even covered it all and channel five do they were going to cover up for ...\nIt's the cover so yeah it's an area that they would do propaganda piece at the Newseum and want to call them all the shot you call it you know what he's done that's exactly what he's done and\nIt's so interesting um I look at the tendency in today maybe I missed it did you see the story\nAbout the project no no ... about his staff nurse inside admitting that that the guy's a liar\nSo if you were a real journalist\nAnd you wanted to get to the bottom of the story about this video shot at the ... Senate campaign headquarters with people speaking who were there in positions of authority and exercising that authority on behalf of the British and Senate campaign\nWell not not being paid by the ... campaign according to the FCC report\nThey would not be that we we report that they were not paid by the British and campaign\nBut they were getting to go in and out of the officers and had like their own officers and their own pace and they found out what\nTo do telling people what to do on behalf of the breast and campaign so if you were a real journalist you know I think what you might do or you might you might go knock on the door of the ... Senate campaign offices on West End here West End area here of Nashville\nIt's not that far from the agency a newsroom or the ... to channel five or ten of for newsrooms\nBut you know uh apparently nobody from the Tennessean nobody from news channel five nobody from the TV stations was able to figure out the map well enough to go and knock\nOn the do they have the ap I mean the app on their phone it's like I\nNearly but you know there is one Seventeen twenty eighth avenue north right on the ... campaign website well guess what\nOur intrepid reporter Chris Butler did just that knocked on their door yeah he he ... he he got out of his office and he drove his car and he parked at any knocked on the doors\nHe didn't stay in the liberal Tennessee a newsroom new little cubicle just you're reading whatever talking on a sensor him and then he just they regurgitate it as knows that he didn't do that he\nDid some investigative reporting he knocked on the door\nAnd when they open the door others there was a sign on the door [laughter] sign of the doors said basically a a ... another door says ah it it says you know Phil Bredesen US Senate\nAnd they put a sign up and the sign says uh we don't allow any videotaping here [laughter] we don't know if they put that up or after\nThird of home or find a donor driving your car for the ... or ... from the ... but it can get from on our ...\nWe gave them and I always think if somebody feels planning to me they're asking me to fix the complaints apartment and most of the time is not the case there just venting is over but I think I have a responsibility to fly from what the hell of asking for a\nRush Limbaugh and that's why I don't whine\nAnd complain because I\nThink I'm asking for something so\nWhy have they can find us on TALK radio Fifteen ten W well ac how long will it take you to get\nFor Mallory lane to Madison Time saver traffic follows Fox News on TALK\nRadio Ninety eight point three and fifty Dan W.
