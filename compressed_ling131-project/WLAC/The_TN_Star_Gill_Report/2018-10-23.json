Democrats around the house you know exactly what you're gonna get they're going to try and pay the price and then paint a cabin out they don't care about your wallet they just want to get in your wallet and the Republicans in charge\nBut I mean the economy moving forward we're going to secure our border we're going to deal with our enemies throughout the world we are going to rebuild our military a cab to name with a speck of all I have a salad and the history of the Senate they've caravans will never be stopped by Nancy Pelosi\nSenator Lindsey Graham speaking right there uh the mob rule of the Democratic party also other president last night in his rally for did Cruz said the GOP creates jobs Democrats create mobs talking about\nUh obviously some of the uh ... issues that have gone on in this country the last couple of beers the attack on a police or this illegal immigrant invasion as a lot of people are are describing it ah from Honduras are hitting this way and um you know which are Michael it's kind of a a\nA situation here where people have to look at you know the current events and see what's going on and and make a decision which way they want to go I Would say\nWhether you like politics or not the um [noise] the divide is pretty clear to me I mean I think it it's not like there's a gray areas here right I mean if you want a mobs like we're seeing come not from the south\nThen a few below sea and Chuck Schumer and the other like minded people are your people are they're the ones you should vote\nOr ... now it's interesting as a lot of this really bad rhetoric is coming from the leadership of the Democratic party and I I I suppose we ought to give the ten second to hide the children warning here for a second [laughter]\nTen seconds hide the children were going to say something that's not that awful but um it's coming up so you might want to to hide the children here for a bit yeah let's\nGive him a few seconds away from the radio here\nYeah just a few seconds so I'm ... turns out that the rhetoric among democratic candidate is really getting out of control\nIn a ... a Philadelphia area congressional district there was a debate between the Republican uh Brian Fitzpatrick and the Democratic challenger Scott Wallace he's the grandson\nOf the former progressive candidate for president Henry Wallace and he he's a very wealthy guy\nWell he didn't like something you did this debate was held in a synagogue\nAnd Scott Wallace the Democrat didn't like something that fits Patrick the ... the guy said and guess what he dropped the F bomb in a synagogue\nIn a house of worship right I mean first of all just a dialogue\nAnd the lack of civility right or with the debate so he comes to the debate and thinks he's going to agree with everything his opponent as to say he's making ridiculous is that you know people talk about temperament right I mean doesn't that show lack of temperament lack of a a class\nYou know if you're you're dropping vulgarity is right there in a debate\nAnd then his apology was you know one of these not apologies well I'm Sorry for the language I use but you know I was very frustrated at my opponent wasn't even that bother you to\nWrite what happened to get frustrated again on the floor of the house of representatives\nEarly you know what that may translate into and I'm not sure I Believe this but in NBC News Atta had an analysis of early voting and I don't know exactly how they did it they had a group that apparently just looked at actual voter turnout early voter turnout in seven states\nAnd they found that based on that analysis of the Republicans are by a significant margin who early voting here in Tennessee they said Republicans were out voting Democrats by a sixty three percent to thirty percent margin based on their analysis how 'bout that\nYeah you know that is interesting because I get all my information from the Houston Chronicle a who did their analysis before people started building [laughter]\nIt was two years ago but the thing is I keep seeing or hearing these pundits on TV talk about how early voting is really helping Democrats drive it early voting is is sort of the two of the Democrats are using but here you have some evidence\nAnd they can look and see whether uh you know registered Republicans or Democrats or you know if they're actually voting can't do who they're voting for him but you can tell if they're going to the polls ear and apparently the evidence is um is opposite of what many of these pundits\nThing I'm not sure I totally by the methodology I haven't looked into it enough about it is one report out there of how early voting is going and let me tell you something if or if early voting is a GOP by a two to one margin in Tennessee\nUh I'd say it's not only is it by by Carl Marx dean it's by by Phil Bredesen\n[noise] yeah I mean it's a a you know the situation really where\nAre their one side may be more energized and the other I think his cabinet hearing and I think you do to as a is played a role in this because people were paying attention you know there's some issues\nAre getting the weeds about taxes or get into the weeds about some a complicated a piece of legislation people may not be you know paying close attention to it I mean after all gotta you gotta go to work you gotta you know pay your taxes you got to\nKnow if your father working\nYeah [laughter] right\nIf you if you're a Democrat you're sitting at home watching soap operas not ... but we're making up their eyes generalization but\nYeah I like to do that [laughter] [laughter] but I only learned is [laughter] you know you're working on it right but the other thing is that a a ...\nI mean if you if you look at how or something like a Kavanaugh hearing or I I go back to this whole thing about a\nThese are illegal immigrants who are coming up here on whatever you want to call him caravan invasion whatever army uh people are paying attention to this it ... it could make a difference or an energizing maybe a a Republican vote now\nMedia is going to find people who think we should go and shoot him down right I mean I've already seen a couple of a new stories on the media the media dot coms gotta\n... from some renegade news outlet of interviewing people who think we should just shoot 'em all\nBut the um the thing is so this was going to be played this way and um you know the president's going to have to deal with it um and hope he does it the you know in Iraq fashion here because it could be a very significant to show\nHow the Democrats really just want people to come here without any orderly process whatsoever and those are on the right really would like to see something done in a legal process\nDoug as we close out the early edition of the ... report let me just ask you this I think the energy we saw as a Trump rally in Houston last night which apparently like a hundred thousand

L. A. C. as we continue to watch the uh\nThe army marching towards America there wasn't like a thousand miles away somebody who's doing the calculation that that based upon the distance that they have to cover to get to to say the the border of Texas it it would take them Seventy days so how are they making this march in like three weeks\nIf they were just walking but I have a feeling they might be getting some assistance from people who are organizing it you know like oh I don't know the cartel or maybe somebody distantly related to George Soros or the Democrats\nYeah they're they're like a a this mob this now a mile long\nEight to ten thousand people marching marching this direction apparently there robbing and pillaging as they go along like an invading army their their robbing the the Mexican stores and homes taking food taking whatever they want because they they can just do whatever they want they can do whatever they want because nobody's going to stop him because they are a large mob\nAnd and they just you know as they pass at grocery stores up is going to take what they want\nSome people have been asking how are they how are they feeding themselves are they taking care of themselves\nThey're they're just pillaging as they go\nThey're stealing yes so they're criminals\nWho want to criminally and illegally enter our country and you've got the left already tried to play this compassion game of oh we need we need to be compassionate what would Jesus do veggies would say don't break\nThe law render enter Cesar ... which is ...\nAnd isn't it interesting how the Democrats have left is always so quick to dump the Bible when they think it can help their political cause and yet they they aren't talking about the biblical admonitions in terms of protecting the life\nOf the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman that they they only want to use the the contorted biblical um use as a political weapon\nWhen when it serves their purpose to say you need to do this you need to do that not we need to or I Need to do this or the Bible is based on what I Do not what I tell you to do and and yet that's what the Democrats want to turn it into\nWe're related story has a tendency star about to George Soros is rented evangelicals are who basically are at twisting scripture to support social justice ideology\nYou again the uh the the Jesus as admonitions to help the poor we're not to go help yourself to other people's money to give to the poor to buy their votes that's that has nothing to do with what Jesus crates yes I'm I'm telling you to go take your neighbors money\nAnd then give it to the poor so they will vote for you that I just can't fight it's not in Corinthians it's not in math I Can't find it anywhere\nIt's not even in what two currencies\nNo I'm not an issue or an audience and and it certainly wasn't in the sermon on them out you know go go forced to take your neighbor's stuff give it to the poor so they will vote for you that's that's just not what\nYou know there's ... great uh names for this invading army you called it the ah what the the trail of take our stuff trail take our stuff is another name to in their

towards the United states do you think that the growing number of illegals that are pouring towards our country do you think this will move\nIndependent voters I mean again we're we um we we know that that that the two political party affiliated groups Republicans tend to be gravitating now and getting enthused on the Republican side Democrats tend to be gravitating to their own team and and getting enthused on the Democrat side but what about these independence what about this this muddy middle\n... where are they moving as they look at these issues as they look at the Kavanaugh hearings as they look at the the mobs in this country is they look at this marching mobbed towards America\nHow is that playing with the independence and and it's kind of ironic because\nYou know we hear so much about the polling and they're they are now telling us that the polls are showing that that things are tightening in those battleground house races we've been saying for months now\nThat if they would poll the battleground seats in the battleground states they would find that this this whole blue wave ... was not real that it was it was close\nAnd that these battleground districts in these battleground states are are too close to call and now that's what they're ... they're pulling the thirty one races instead of the sixty one races didn't include a lot of of dark blue districts that had been\nIt created by Republicans who have been reelected because they weren't ... they've been overstating the blue wave by over polling districts that really aren't contested now that they're focused in on the seats\nIn districts that are swing districts that will determine who gets the gavel as the next speaker they're finding that it's it's too close to call just as we've been saying Michael for for months\nThe momentum appear to be moving towards Republicans in the Honduran Army\nWhich for a letter to purposes is referred to as the caravan ... cabinet and caravan uh that doesn't seem to be playing well with the voters of either party a or with independents in particular\nDoing rather than than what the Tennessee and does when they tried to claim that you know he somehow you

L. A. C. seven three seven Ninety five twenty two if you want to join us on the phone lines did you what did you see that big rally in Texas last night Donald Trump or making nice with the with Ted Cruz\nAs not lying to any he's not he's Texas dead [laughter] beautiful to Texas to Texas Ted works better think yeah that that's because you just look at them and you know he's not\nBeautiful and it was a packed house and there were there were thousands used outside hundred thousand people wanted tickets to this Trump the vet and man he was in he was in pure Trump forum last night I mean he was ripping going off on\nEverything is expressing his view that maybe needs to nominate Hillary Clinton to the Supreme Court so that you would actually be investigated by the fake news media I mean that's funny he was rolling\nHey he funding the guy he's an entertainer\nAnd and and Louie Gohmert is one of my favorite members of Congress looking I've been buddies for a long time we spend the gift on the show repeatedly and we've caught up with him at various events the Texas congressman and\nAnd Trump just kept railing on Louis last night's Lou Louis got raises a Louis ... doesn't need your ... you don't need you don't need them to vote for you do your Louie, Louie will say that your vote but you know he's wanted like by sixty point don't don't vote for ... and all these other guys the Germans don't vote for a little over it I mean he just kept coming back in ...\nYou know and I noticed um I I have a feeling of momentum here now of course Texas is a place to generate that momentum because Texas\nThe character of Texas connected to Tennessee historically and through many other means the character of Texans is in many ways the epitome of what is American John Wayne independent\nDon't tell me what to do X rayed on my own boss you know I Try my own course that's Texans\nDare I say you're not the boss of me you're not talking about something and you're not the Boston me kind of testing\nIn the butt Texans are in you know don't don't give a Texan any grief\nAnd I think that rally\nMay be ratcheting up the enthusiasm among Republicans to take back America and it reminded me of the kind of momentum you saw in the days before the two thousand sixteen General Electric did you did you get that feeling as well\nYeah we we were out you know doing lift the vote and again if folks we've got a new website up lift the vote dot org we upgraded the site you can check it out and lift the vote dot org our focus was the turnout Christian evangelical voters and the two thousand sixteen election and Christmas Eve in ... voters need to turn out in this election in Tennessee and around the country\nBut we were in Ohio we were in Florida we were in North Carolina Michigan Pennsylvania Colorado and and again those last few weeks you could you could feel a momentum shift it feels the same way that the that that we saw in those last few weeks in part of the way you can tell that that's that's that's where we're heading is because\nThe left is is is freaking out because they they didn't call it right in sixteen\nAnd and they're afraid they're seeing the the re boot they're they're afraid they're seeing the sequel to two thousand sixteen\nThe fact that they're starting to freak out tells me more about what's happening out there than than the polls or anything else that we can look at by the way I wouldn't voted early yesterday a Dana and Remy went into and voted early and you know ... you know are are Eighteen Nineteen months old granddaughter got her I voted sticker she was so proud of it\nUm the lines were massive and ended the Brentwood library down Williamson county they're getting a thousand to two thousand early voters a day I haven't seen lines like that\nFor presidential election years much less during an early voting\nDid you see the NBC report that came out which sad and and I I think they did this a methodology was an analysis of actual early voting reports I I don't think it was a a\nPolling or exit polling uh but but they claim that they've looked at the partisan turn out early voting in several key states one of which was Tennessee they claim\nThat sixty three percent of early votes cast in Tennessee had been cast by Republicans\nBack and check people's voting records if they voted in Republican primaries are democratic primaries it is possible to check that and and that's apparently what they're doing let's go quickly seven three seven nine five to two windows you're on the Tennessee star report with Steve dealer Michael Patrick Leahy good morning\nHere Jaime thanks I Want to be\nOn that earlier or later so humor\n[laughter] I think one of the gay they're gay and then the other you know I got a panic that truck through the gay\nLet 'em out\nWell and they certainly wouldn't object to the ... once they get dropped off at the homes of these liberals and and again we've made the same point here that you know if if you're a poor person living in say east Nashville north Nashville\nLook at the houses that have the Karl Dean and the Phil Bredesen signs in front of them because they want to welcome you to come into their house uninvited\nTake their stuff sleep on their couch or maybe in the spare bedrooms upstairs and they'll start providing you with health care and and funds you going to college because that's what they want the American taxpayers to do for illegals there is no reason if they want the illegals to come here to get stuff\nThat that that is that is not there is that they would object to people who are ... are poorer than them\nGoing into these these are neighborhoods in green hills and bell made that have these\nDemocrat yard signs in their front yard which is a good way to identify yes please come in and take our stuff so\nI don't even need to have the illegals they're just here locally if you're poor than rich people go in and they will not call the cops I Can't imagine they would be hypocritical enough to call the cops and report you for coming in and taking their stuff because that's what they want it legal to do in our country\nI thought about going down in Europe\nThen all the
