L. A. C. I'm John Kelly the c._e._o. and editor in chief of the Tennessee star Michael Patrick Leahy is here check out a the tendency star website this morning for commentary and latest headlines tendency star\nDot com or want to get the Michael thoughts here about the amendment one on the ballot or dealing\nWith the a ... sort of a constitutional I guess I'm a amendment here dealing with a vote coming up and get his thoughts are on I was just looking again Michael about the uh the mega lottery that no one one last night the odds of winning okay they're going to do it again on friday the odds of winning chance of matching all six numbers and taking home the grand prize\nIs one and three hundred two point five million that's slightly better odds right then they listen to the\nMore you know American slightly better I better the odds that Elizabeth Warren actually has an American and several by might take it on my way to go see it that you're not into this huh well\nYou know you you pointed out when you say that this is why Elizabeth Warren's uh uh the entire episode surrounding her a claims of Native American ancestry so bad for her\nA ridicule is the worst possible thing for a political candidate and now I mean for the rest of her career\nUh she just keep doing this thing up and she's just ...\nIt's fodder for comedians an old radio guys uh you know he liked to pile on you know what I Do get them either down yes it yeah\nAll right let's talk about and you've got a story Tennessee star dot com this morning as a member of the fraternal order of police are not real happy with amendment one here uh let's talk about that because it's on the ballot coming out\nYes he's on the ballot in Davidson county and the proposal is to have a review board for a the police here and it is controversial in this regard it it has the potential I think to become highly politicized\nAnd as a an awful lot of negative consequences for the police here in Nashville and are they the fraternal order of police held a press conference yesterday afternoon and distort the steps of the\nNashville metro courthouse in our own Chris Butler was there and he found a report the lead story of tendency star and in it\nHe expressed how the spokesperson for the fraternal order of police said there were probably constitutional problems with issue one\nAnd that was denied due process to the police officers involved and they may have a very good point there [noise] um right now I Would have to say that the the odds are probably that's the best the a referendum passes\nOut and then uh it will likely see a court challenge based upon that that concept\nAnd you can see already that the you know the national police and the metro police folks don't like it the journal horror of police don't like it I think it's gonna be fraught with problems uh my guess is that unless something changes so it will pass because Nashville I I got a little secret here\nIt's liberal there\nYes it's a blue area at times and no doubt about it you know one of the things to Michael I guess is why would you have such a a civilian panel really overseeing a business in the first place right there right now there's going to be sort of a due process if there's a problem that maybe people have with somebody law enforcement's done\n[noise] yeah well yeah you know you also had a little bit of reality theater there because Davy Tucker junior a pastor at Nashville's beach creek missionary Baptist church\nOf literally interrupted the press conference or to say that uh the the police review board was actually a racial issue the quote was a quote you got a bunch of old white men who are talking it is so strange that this becomes an issue for accountability and quote\nNot exactly a come together moment\nNo not not at all I Know some cities have have done this maybe like a mayor has a you know appointed a some kind of they'll call it a bipartisan a community a commission to oversee this is is this in this case the voters were to approve this Michael is there any kind of a authority behind this\nThis border to just sort of an advisory type of a set up\nThat's a good question I think it it actually would have the authority to recommend a disciplinary actions against the police officers into you know could could and could involve all sorts of a legal problems for the police officers involved you know the argument against it as is already a multiple\nLevels of of review for police actions\nI I think you know the the general problem is going to be this thing passes it's going to be a mess either way now there was also report\nThat if it doesn't pass a mayor Riley might just issue an executive order\nFrom wherever you are or how ... got a gift of life dot org and get a free from

lethargic decide well we think we have a good idea we ought to do this do you take it from idea to implementation that's how America's always succeeded that's how sports team succeed that says businesses succeed you take it from the idea\nFlush it out implemented and and hopefully make it a success so you have the opportunity if you'll go to um to fly asked president dot com tomorrow websites not up yet will have it up tomorrow flies president dot com you'll be able to order the Trump the flies president ... in the meantime\nGo to the Facebook page Tennessee star on Facebook you can actually see the ... seats that are palatial studio palatial as well and and uh and get a glimpse\nKind of ... we have a terrific guest a highly shape for the former Shelby County commissioner\nThey got mark Norris who's the state senator in Memphis who's now been through the confirmation process for armed not nearly as contentious as Brett Kavanaugh he's going to be a federal judge or he's the Senate majority leader right now he's got to be moving aside I guess I'm resigning almost immediately\nWell it's a it's a it's a bit of a twisted and long story and uh but tiny Schaffer has the details and will tell us all those details\nSo we have late vacancy in the states but with an election\nUnderway with early voting starting gardening today to handle that I don't know but it might even find out how they will tell us also Harriet Wallace is gonna joined us today here at the uh W's ETV Fox Seventeen reporter\nWho didn't just take mark brown the Democrat spokesman hearing Tennessee's word for it when he said oh we weren't paying these staffers they were just volunteers to Bredesen staffers that got caught\nYou know telling the truth about what Phil Bredesen really thinks about Donald Trump when he really thinks about while Tennessee ignorance voters\nHe he lied and Harry Wallace followed up and called you paid for by mark green for Congress\nThe world's most ... voice\nYou feel now about coming soon\nRaasch Hannity on Fox News talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen cents\nAnd now it's back to the Tennessee report which the deal and Mike Lee [noise]\nThere was back in ... says the Tennessee star reports seven three seven nine five to to the phone number do you want to join us and share your thoughts as if the political season couldn't get more complicated in confusing\nOr it's a good thing you know state senator mark Norris great guy gets elevated to ah to the federal judiciary gets through the confirmation process gets appointed federal judge by Donald Trump President Trump and yes that leaves a vacancy in the state Senate while we're\nWe're right in the midst of an election early voting starts they by the way to get out get your votes cast a get your friends to get out their get their votes cast we can't be complacent but in the midst of an election you don't have a vacancy how does that work for the seat in Memphis\nWell um our good friend former Shelby County commission chairman Heidi Schaefer is on the line with us right now in highly will tell us what's going on down there in Memphis with this uh uh resignation pending a state senator mark Norris welcome welcome\nTo talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W. L. A. C. Heidi Heidi didn't warning y'all it's good to talk with you\nSo tell us all the twists and turns because of course the you know\nMark Norris was nominated to be a federal judge back in July of last year and only a just like a week a week ago I guess it was was he confirmed by the Senate or has he resigned yes what is the process to replace it what's the story down there in Shelby County Heidi\n... on an interesting story and and we've only got some clarity about twenty four hours ago on yes mark Norris has not resigned\nYet and apparently\nNot even the resignation as the trigger you know there's always a legal trigger for what creates the position and that's what I understand what creates the trigger is\nActually um notifying the court and and you know after you're swearing in Utah where it gets warning notify the court and apparently that's the big trigger but he has not yet the interesting thing was as when\nWord first came that he got finally confirmed after you know what is it Seventeen line\nA long time waiting and waiting I'm watching the first thing that happened with the secretary of state Trey target tweeted something out phone\nThat there would be a ... that's what happened at the November ... election\nWell that's just like in less than three weeks away right\nExactly an early voting starts today\nAnd it wouldn't it wouldn't have been um anywhere in the voting computer systems they wouldn't have been mailed out on the military an absentee ballot for you to have some voters disenfranchised with the way they were reading some of the conflict state statutes\nWave that um it would have to be handwritten and you'd have to request to special special paper ballot and right in the name Kelvin name correct life\nUm and then you could you could actually have ten thousand separate candidates being written and and then those that have to be an tabulate id and can you know can I hear hanging chads\nBut it would have rejected that that theory of how to do it at this point right\nWell it hasn't been confirmed that yesterday\nUm we got notification from uh when we got an interview published from try hard to get by but it's likely that since it will take some time for senator north to close down his his law practice that it will likely not happen after November fast\nSo I think that that's probably um I think that's probably a good indication that it will not happen before November ... which is the selection which means it then it will go along a more normal process which will be a special election by the governor and then a primary and the general\nSo we're looking at probably February March when the when the primary and general elections will happen I actually\nHeard that they're going to try to speed that up and to have the primary in December and the general in January and to try to avoid having an appointed a person takes place\nFor a small amount of mine um you know they try to get somebody solid in there for at least the next couple of years\nWhen will this be finalized do you think that we're the replacement process\nI think it will be finalized after November sex it won't be finalized until ... especially the vines um and then I think the resignation moving trigger\nOn I think that can trigger this special that Governor calling for a special election at that point and I think that the resignation that triggers the governor to call for this special election but the seat isn't actually technically they can become he gets on the ...\nProcess actually makes makes a lot of sense when you compare that the cabinet process he was a federal judge moving to a different federal judge ship or as a justice of the Supreme Court he wasn't having to to tie up the loose ends of a private practice do or an exit\nFrom a private practice to move into the federal judiciary Kevin I'm simply moving from one federal position do another federal position so that the ability to have him confirmed and literally sworn in that same day was an easy process as as you point out with with more nor has he has to tie up his practice resign from his practice\nAnd and except I guess in a formal way the judicial position and begin to start that job and and that resignation from the state Senate will happen at that time which then triggers an opening right now there is not an opening in the states in\n... that come back and correct and you know I'm senator Norris you know we all know him as senator north leader or is that he has an act of love access and back he's got some cases that are ongoing\nRight now that have come up in front of the Shelby County commission and I'm saying you know you can't leave for a good person won't leave their clients get hanging right and say hey sorry for y'all\nYou know and says he's going to do what's right and he's going to close down his practice get his\n... bulldozer\nGroup of folks who got folks their big news\nToday shares big news
