our life is not supposed to be all about politics and I'm Wondering if this sort of a inner connection that's going on with social media gives more of a rise to that lunatic out there to the see I I like his voice is somehow credible and maybe this kind of ... you know helped create this atmosphere what do you think\nYeah I agree I think a lot of people have stupid thoughts throughout their life for most of history they've they've kept those thoughts themselves and not die damage to any one right right I don't\nWant it out there everyone ride ... as soon as you think it\nYeah now as soon as you think something stupid [laughter] you can share it with the entire world and it lives forever I you know I used to my my my children anything digital lives forever\nAnd that is true can you imagine if we had ah the Internet back in the days of ah the founding fathers you know Franklin and a ... and John Adams were often at ... at odds and\nJefferson and Hamilton of course were at odds

right I mean there's a\nYou know the the free speech or to them is speech or to keep them from hearing speech they don't like rather than the opposite is true that free speech was put in their free speech that we don't like because you don't have to protect speech you like\nWhat we see the impact of this on civic engagement in voting behavior and\nVoting behavior in this election there was a report in Knoxville a new set ... and now of course that is a good ... newspaper so I'm not sure if it's a credible source [laughter] but there was a report where they were they did an analysis of voting in Knox County\nUh comparing the early voting they're based upon a\nKnowable history of each voter drums of past voting behavior\nAnd their nails and I'm not sure I Believe this but I'll just tell you what their analysis was\nTheir analysis was that only three percent of the votes cast a in early voting so far in Knox County that come from a a a people age Eighteen to twenty four\nThat is a stunning lack of participation if true\nYeah and again they don't realize how important it is and that to be engaged you know really in in the process but also about the you know having the right to

I always thought sooner or later you're gonna get that road runner yeah uh never did ... or ... or to violate the young people now you know that right oh let's see do I think we just heard of the world works\nIn a very serious [laughter] so but we we know that that they were not competent\nAs bomb makers that's one thing for sure\nBut regardless of the origin of these uh legit bomb suspicious packages bomb threats that aren't working apparently a immediately after you saw the full mainstream media onslaught\nWithout evidence to blame President Trump's for this and that was of course a James Clapper on CNN or you had that Jeff Zucker uh\nThe the head of a CNN go out with a full on a salt a verbal assault on the president at all it does is I think it confirms the at the idea that the mainstream media literally is the opposition party I think it backfires on them what do you think uh\n[noise] yeah I think it does a you know the other thing is is trying to connect the dots that are really don't exist or too far away like a a that somehow Donald Trump is a cause and then this is the effect of a a President Trump oh we never had\nAny sort of dialogue that people will find uncomfortable in the past in a blue fickle environment come on you know are told you the pundits were uh were sort of a connecting that that this is like the sixties and seventies I don't know but he's anywhere near like that actually now\nOr is this unprecedented so many a male type bombs were sent out how to a well known political figures maybe so but as you pointed out we're not even sure is or the incompetent bomb makers were these really are set out to not detonate in the first place because\nI've I've watched a number of bomb experts on TV say they have no idea how something like this would not have made it through the mail process that would have been injured a postal worker or\nOr someone in an office uh who's handling this these packages that these are so\nVolatile that uh it it certainly would have exploded so I don't know I'm not a bomb expert but I Do know one thing that that the speculation doesn't lead to the fact that Donald Trump's or cause of it necessarily because we've had a you know some I guess you'd call it ... or various\nDialogue among political people for a long day this is nothing new\nBut duck duck duck you gotta realize of course Donald Trump calmed down yes Donald Trump is the cause of every bad thing that has ever happened in America you didn't know that well that's\nTrue you have to call the very great thing to write I mean I Know how people feel about it and it's one way or the other with him it's ... I I have you ever seen a politician that people have so strong opinions one way or the other I mean it's I I Can't remember someone that uh that kinda garnered this kind of emotion\nAmong among people here but at the same time you can't blame him for things he didn't necessarily initiate\nI you know you can go I think what you're seeing here though is a change in the composition of America\nIn other words a President Trump is it a traditional American he's a gung ho get it done America is the is the greatest country in the world America is exceptional ... ... the people that are criticizing President Trump are really criticizing America\nAnd what you're seeing is a huge growth in the percentage of Americans who basically hate America\nAnd many of them are in the mainstream media there in academia uh they they have grown and grown and grown and grown and become very aggressive in setting forth their particular view of how America a was wrong and be should change\nYeah but you know you can criticize politicians whoever they may be President Trump or whatever it's due she'll be civil about it the right I mean the whole problem here is that it seems to me is that we make these

I mean we've posted a picture of the\nCoyote after I think like Seventy thousand share it's\nGot a huge shares because it's a funny and things that are\nProbably true kind of origin or have an element of truth that's what ... and the funny that's what people share and that is funny because you know fuck who has created more effective bombs Wylie coyote or the CNN\nBomb or whatever you call them the suspicious packages that they are now calling yeah even they're not even trying to claim that their bombs anymore they're calling them suspicious packages and they're up to what like ten fan and they they apparently all originated or at least that's what are some of the inside sources are saying from Florida\nFrom one male house in in South Florida in the Miami area Miami area so how how does some of them get hand delivered and and not have a cancellation stamp\nAnd others apparently do have a cancellation stamp and you're one of the other big questions that people are asking about this is it the CNN one it it has all the earmarks of them promoting a hoax promoting\nClick bait to draw attention to their to their network to to try and use this as a marketing tool for them because you you would not normally put out the picture of the bombed the FBI the investigation underway you wouldn't want this information out there that might give\nOther copycats an idea that might give the bomber or the suspicious package cinder which is probably a more appropriate claim because many of these had no way\nOn his delivering packages it's not going through the U.S postal service you're seeing fed ex you're seeing UPS people are doing everything they can except the post office and I gotta tell ya based upon my experience just in the last week of a nine day delay\nIn a in a postcard that has

is it going to impact the election will just blow back on the Democrats are will with America just basically yawn and go we never believe this and the ...\nI think right now it's sort of a young but I'm with you I Am surprised at the slow pace of this investigation ... of course you know it to this just happened past forty eight hours but things move so rapidly today I would've thought\nThat by this time we would have had more information other than oh gosh we think it came from a a poster facility\nNear Miami that day but again I'm I'm a I think right now we don't based on what we know

their candidates will say something stupid if they talk about this because their instincts are going to be to downplay it to\nDismiss it to basically say what you're seeing in the images on TV who
