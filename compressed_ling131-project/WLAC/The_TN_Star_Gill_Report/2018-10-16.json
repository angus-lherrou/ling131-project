L. A. so you'd be like to join in during the hour a welcome to the October sixteen thousand Eighteen edition of the early edition and we're glad to have you here it seemed like Elizabeth Warren has made the news once again maybe preparing your or waiver a presidential bid that's\nGot to the conclusion a lot of people had after a she tried to use one of these DNA tests if you haven't heard too ... documented that she is part Native American which she had been using a as a way of a a really getting jobs in the past and so\nUh she released the results yesterday rarely does she took the bait President Trump said in one of his rallies\nOr to to take a test and she did and then released the results\nAnd I guess at this point should be left off the planet I'm because it turned out she was one thousand and the twenty fourth or something like that Native American apparently more ah most Americans are even more than that\nOr if you go back to the ancestry of the Cherokee Nation yesterday reacted strongly\nA Orrin Hatch even tweeted eighty seven year old Orrin Hatch the U.S Senate said that a ... you know sort of mocking this whole thing he said\nWell I'm One thousand and twenty fourth dinosaur [laughter] like some other you know US Senate Michael Patrick Leahy is here at the c._e._o. and editor in chief of the tendencies darn good morning to you or have you done your DNA test yet I Believe It's MORNING exiting learning all\nPatrick Leahy I guess you could say I'm probably Irish metric\nGo low battery [laughter] you know a legit I of course [laughter] if if you're in this part of the country more than likely you've got a some a Native American blood and yet from uh from past I don't know how much removed what was hers was like um well six generations back or something like this she's trying to use\nWell asterisk asterisk asterisk yes so let let's just give Elizabeth Warren let's say the benefit of the doubt for the moment about the results of this a DNA test asterisk\nSoviet my best the very best a possibility the the highest percentage of the Native American asterisk ancestry she might have\nIs one point six percent that's a very highest the uh the fellow who read the the DNA uh analysis\nOf the Gino type data that was provided to him by the DNA lab Dr Carlos Bustamante from Stanford University\nA said that he concluded that the her Native American ancestor uh was probably either six generations or ten six to ten generations back well you do the math\nSix generations would be one sixty fourth Native American or one point six percent but ten generations back would be one tenth of one percent now it turns out of the average uh\nA European or American has two tenths of one percent Native American ancestry so she's got as much they've American ancestry ah according to her own report as the average American however let's look at this report a little bit\nOf a couple of things sort of stand out first Dr Carlos Bustamante did not use in his little computer program of modeling program you know sort of sort of like a global warming modeling program [laughter]\nTo assess this and in other words you're within your own information that's what you're saying right well you put your results would you want out of it OK well look at\nThe he ... he didn't have enough Native American uh\nUh from the United states or in the database so what he calls Native Americans are individuals from Peru Colombia to Mexico yeah uh that's actually not Native American by most people's definitions that's actually Hispanic\nBy most people's definitions so that's problem number one problem number two there's a little thing called chain of custody\nSo if you're doing a DNA test do established paternity those are very rigorous chain of custody standards you take the DNA sample somebody you know says yes so and so took a Louis Warren took this DNA and then they take it to the lab and they say yes this came from\nMadison dash free dot

you know the year of the nation I actually did have a response\nYes they they don't consider all this really all that a a humorous in back really they ... they don't in the you're right they did they they have their own response they\nAre after Elizabeth Warren came out with her test the showing she's one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American as you correctly pointed out and did this the research on this uh that's even less than most people who live in this country apparently um the uh you know the Cherokee Nation which does exist came out with their own a a comment then they\nGot this is that the largest uh uh Cherokee tribe or in Oklahoma Cherokee Nation um these are the descendants\nOf those who were rounded up in the Eighteen thirties and the trail of tears from Tennessee and Georgia and the surrounding areas and and uh we're resettled in\nOklahoma by the way a a\nLoose with Warren's great great great grandfather Johnson Crawford was a member of the tendency militia that rounded those Cherokees up here in Tennessee\nLast [laughter] yeah you can't make this stuff up so they they they called her DNA test a that showed you know best case scenario if you believe that\nThat uh um uh she has between one tenth of one percent and one point six percent Native American ancestry if you believe the testing\nUm they called it inappropriate and a mockery and secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation Chuck ... junior said quote\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America and quote so you know they they were not happy at all he went on to say quote\nWell can you blame them I don't even know where to hatch says he's one one thousand twenty four dinosaur [laughter] you know I mean everybody's got their own uh\nYou know my weight from yesterday Doug ... Kelly Conway is communication I've heard of ... yeah she she set out a tweet it was funny it said\nOne over one thousand twenty four does not equal two thousand twenty oh wow that's good\nThat's good I think everyone thinks I think Trevor Noah was terminal I think the comedian I think he said that of course he's he's kind of a foreign leftist but he said last night the the DNA tests now proves she's running for president [laughter] have a lot of people think was going on here get it out of the way but you know you're it's backfired on her\nAnd now it'll be a you know sort of a conversation if she does get in there more so than it would have been I thing\nAnd and uh that's uh makes you gotta wonder about her political ...\nWhile the other problem with this DNA test is okay give best case scenario if she at one point six percent Native American that she claimed from Nineteen eighty five on\nThat she was Native American she made those claims while professor at University of Pennsylvania law school that was part of her\nAcademic package submitted to Harvard law school when they were considering her for a tenured position of that was a misrepresentation because the the lowest possible standard you could have to make that claim would be you know six percent\nNative American but the even that's very low and they did yeah that is gaming the system right there ... and ... her own DNA tests confirmed that she was scanning the system to put herself in her career advancing position that's not good\nNo and that would be a you know I think most of us would consider that's really an ethics violation if not a some sort of a you know a criminal sort of behavior I think it is you know we're trying to get a job and above someone when they were giving some sort of preference in the affirmative action area\nUh to those who were Native Americans or they can increase diversity which is what the\nYou know liberal uh universities and Colorado after all about right\n... and Harvard reported to the federal government that she was Native American and not exactly correct\n... interesting yeah so again I mean that's the real story you know while we get tied up in in the fact that she she did this test and uh basically brood what most people dodge he's\nNot he don't like and like my parents about ready to hire me if you don't have an open mind and workplaces hoping to everyone if you don't realize that America works when everybody what can you do what can you can ...\nYou can remember that important for people can't what people can do that matters\nNearly fifty million

three and Fifteen to end\nOf the solar Fort Lee is with Kelly Michael Patrick Leahy [noise]\nAlright welcome back it is the early edition thanks for joining us on your commute this morning talk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen to end up you really see the Tennessee Starr Report me early edition\nOr dug in Michael here and um you know there was a story yesterday we don't have time to really get into it but the Kansas City star Kansas City not come as a story that a judge Kavanaugh myself or got our attention beer prices could double under severe increase in rural temperatures caused by global warming and uh\n[laughter] I Love you imagine awful\nSo they're trying to get us on the on the side of the year I'd be ...\nOr try to tell us beer prices will double a at some point in the future I guess because of global warming seeing check out that story\nAlso go to our website Tennessee start time for the latest news headlines about especially what's going on in the\nUS Senate race here in Tennessee yesterday Tennessee Democrats spokesman mark brown called gun owners the biggest terrorist organizations just one of the uh many crazy comments coming out of the left these days Michael\nBoyd that guy uh you know he he he can't say anything that isn't that bad off the lord nasty\n[laughter]\nAh well I mean that's a start you know what I mean the idea though right the gun owners are terrorists by nature is um of course ridiculous we know that but why is it that we have a Second Amendment I mean it's all about the protection of individuals you are right you have a sort of a God given right to protect yourself\nIt's not about hunting you know a lotta time not a hunter or but I Believe strongly in the right that Americans have to defend themselves with whatever means necessary to do so\nAnd um you know our founding fathers thought it was a fairly important amendment when they put a number to protect all the or the right to number one and so um you know we should look at it that way but the the left as they elect people and they really want people on the court\nA that would actually a look the other way when it comes to the second amendment they want to see more and more restrictions on this and uh and so at least they're more open about it I guess we could put it that way right\nYeah and you know as you mentioned it is a big issue here in the Senate race between Democrat former governor Phil Bredesen and the Republican representative Marsha Blackburn a part of the controversy has to do with the fact that Phil Bredesen or claimed\nTo have an a rating from the national Rifle Association where in fact he currently has a de rating and the national Rifle Association has endorsed Marsha Blackburn\nThat's amazing there's a little difference there between a Andy uh [laughter]\nThat's amazing you know uh but again why does it matter and how is it that a gun owners that is law abiding citizens are somehow terrorists right in the in our raise the terrorist organization I guess gun owners of America\nAre they they're a terrorist organization when actually it may be that the uh the law abiding citizen might be you know the one or the one that buffer I guess between a what we have today in total anarchy\nThere's another story relating to this dog at the at Tennessee star the Tennessee star dot com or about bill Bryson's favorite former New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg ... says\nAnother possible presidential guy to in twenty twenty\n... exactly although he hasn't released his DNA yet but [laughter]\nI don't think he's ever claimed to be Native American [laughter] ah but ah but so you know as Michael Bloomberg\nDNA tests show I Wonder if I won't get into that but I Will make you laid on Facebook's yeah oh yeah yeah\nSo um you know last week\nPhil Bredesen who's running for the United States Senate in Tennessee that sustain here that we live in right\nIt the day before the debate with Marsha Blackburn he decided it was time to leave Tennessee because he had to go back to his native state New York and he flew up and he ... he went to the town home\nOf former Mayor Michael Bloomberg to raise money for his campaign not that he's you know connected to New York it or not that he has New York city values no anyway so the Michael Bloomberg\nA story just came out in fact Steve Gail ... founded that back in two thousand Fifteen\nOr at a speech to the Aspen Institute in Colorado [noise]\nMichael Bloomberg said he thought it would be a really great idea to deny Second Amendment rights too young minorities living in a urban areas\nOh nice let's just a bill weighed in with your ah your personal rights and and he was focusing on minorities here is\nExactly and the way I get it yeah and by the way you know we will\nBe the rationale of that Michael I mean honestly I'd say a ... I mean if if some if I'd I I'm trying to figure out what what would be the uh the purpose than you would want to single out any particular ethnic\nWe gave them and I always think of somebody complaining to me they're asking me to fix it does come planks apartment and most of the time is not the case there just venting is over but I think I have a responsibility to fly from what the hell of asking for\nRush Limbaugh and that's why I don't whine\nAnd complain because I\nThink I'm asking for something so\nI hold in all the ones who I have to comply with others on TALK radio Fifteen\nTen W well ac that home quicker we can help map of better route another traffic to update in less than ten minutes on TALK radio Ninety eight only three Fifteen ten W.

V. pay attention to me\nThen that I'll be happy no matter why they're putting me in the spotlight and I think Elizabeth Warren is is playing into that as well if they're just paying attention to me if their spelling my name right it's a good news story\nSo this is a list with Warren's Jerry Springer mountain one yeah\nYeah 'cause I'm nobody's out they're going to live the best [laughter] Springer or the other thing that we need to do today is is to help Elizabeth Warren I mean she's she's clearly doing that he needs on our presence she needs a lot of help I think medication maybe even shock treatment could be\nBy the way it just doesn't aside did you see she went on like a a Twitter rants yesterday she's like she saw this blowing up in front of her face and so she decided the only thing to do was to just go crazy and she'd like you know thirty tweets all of them just increasingly attacking President Trump\nI'm going to deflect you know by by making this about Donald Trump and uh again I think that the way for Trump to respond to this an ad her climate he owes me a million dollars ... million dollars from my charity cause I've proved I'm a Native American actually ma'am you prove you're not\nNative American but but you know Donald Trump being the big ideas and you mentioned this just at the end of the last hour it being the big guy he is he should he should have a check\nFor the point one percent of the million dollars that she has now proved that she is possibly\nNative American Mexican or Peruvian he ought to write a check for a hundred bucks poster selfie of him holding the check and invite her to come by the White House and pick it up anytime give give her percentage share of the of what she's claiming to what to be just right now I Want to help her out and\nAnd also I think we have at one of the songs that that would be good you know she's never going to be president says she's never gonna year hail to the chief although what an appropriate song for Elizabeth Warren maybe that's why she's running she's she's wanting to prove she's Native American because they'll play hey don't do the\nChief if she is president the United states but but before she gets there she needs another theme song and and this might be one President Trump and says rallies with you don't always get what you're looking for this to be hers\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo you could\nJust see her walking into these huge massive you know twelve person rallies while their mother blaring out that that song that there may be other songs I mean shares half breed although\nAlthough this one doesn't even qualify for half breed well it'll be half of half of half half one percent breed doesn't layers war one tenth of one percent ... percent breed I get a day and then quite catch it and I never I people but you'd have to go Google despot pull up the video of share singing half breed\nWhile she's in full Indian regalia had dress\nGets on sale now John\n... who will sue and\nYou can listen to the coast to coast any time with our heart radio it's just a great way for you to stay connected with this program for ever you might be the ... heart radio lap downloaded enjoy it and have some fun\nSean Hannity weekday afternoon to you on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W.

to Oklahoma to save them because if they stayed in the territories where they were in Alabama Tennessee the the militias and the white folks would have just killed\nMe two minutes done exactly what you would call a more conservative oriented writer he's a he's more of a liberal but in this historical book an hour I read that same book fascinating book a lot of great books about Andrew Jackson that argument has been noted\nThat what you know one happening was that the white settlers ah were aggressively pursuing the land of the Cherokee and the president Jackson looked at that and so there's a there's trouble brewing here or we're going to have a\n... at violence and let's see what we can do to end that that was the argument now you know a lot of folks back and forth or uh have different viewpoints on it but I think this demonization of Andrew Jackson um is way out of line\nAnd injects would often to eat out his his explanations of why he was moving the Cherokee I'm moving them because you know and and it was part of the reason his story and I haven't really\nI miss the hidden injuries but I'm sure President Trump is seen them\nWell and you know projects because he was having to put that policy and to a hundred and forty characters and it's just hard to explain you're Indian relocation policies in just a hundred and forty characters so sort of Twitter had allowed

center here talk radio ... only about Lacey forecasts fulltime Arab place with what they have whether Ethel a not a bunch of rain clouds and a few scattered showers around when I turned down to forty

three and Fifteen than\nAnd now back to the tendencies are born with the guilt and Mike Lee [noise]\nI'd recommend it says the Tennessee star reports the deal Michael Patrick Leahy with you [noise]\nSeven three seven nine five to ... to the phone number that's seven three seven nine five to two you can also send your comments via email steep hill show edgy male dot com Steve ... show at

good theme songs four\nBrothers with Warner she goes out on the campaign trail as we pointed out until she gets that hail to the chief that uh that I guess would be a ... point one percent Native American they can't play he'll do the cheap to her\nHealth to the pretender uh I Do like all the nickname so ... to ... we a\nSecond yeah yeah ...\nAnd there's one of my favorites Pocahontas Pocahontas I mean there's just\nA moment and and she's screaming that that we're mocking Indian just like no this but we're we're mocking you and your fake Indian collect she's as bad as that that what does the al ... woman at all they know that she was\nShe was president the N. double ACP out in in like Oregon or Seattle or somewhere and it she claims he was black but now the only white Elizabeth Warren has more Indian blood in her than Rachel Dolezal had a\nHad in her a we mentioned just before the break Michael Bloomberg has a has embraced Phil Bredesen is trying to elect Phil Bredesen to help elect that third senator from New York and in two thousand Fifteen he went and spoke to the Aspen Institute and in\nColorado now let's do a little background on that for people here in Tennessee who may not be familiar with the Aspen Institute now really great movies during the summer right this is the answer is they'll say like you know that the crowd you see at Cracker Barrel here in Tennessee\nNot so much not so much is it more like the crowd you might see at oh I don't know the whole foods [laughter] the whole\nFoods or maybe you and they're built faculty lounge Vanderbilt faculty\nLounge and hedge fund central\nThey gather and talk big ideas from a liberal perspective ideas that that leads you to policies well like Venezuela yeah and how good socialism is and how good it would work if you just didn't have examples of how it doesn't work so the Aspen Institute they grab together liberals and talk big ideas and so Michael Bloomberg was out there to talk\nBig ideas and among the big ideas he came up with was pointing out the fact that Ninety five percent of murders according to Michael Bloomberg's just have you noticed by the way that they don't\nThey don't snopes they don't politifact\nLiberals like Michael Bloomberg when they just make up the fact that Ninety five percent of murders in America are ... thanks to Fifteen to twenty five year old black males like I don't think that's the number but but Michael thanks for playing along anyway he pointed that out and then said that his\nHis way to to solve violent crime in our streets would be to\nTake away guns now from minorities now yeah no he didn't really say I mean he actually said that and and again we're we're going to extrapolate that that if if black males are committing all these murders well by gosh let's go take guns from Asian Americans\nIs all your [noise]\nAfter the verdict verve for\nOne at all [laughter] they are they are [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah that's a real guys as [noise]\n\nYeah we're going to take the guns because you know the second amendment doesn't apply\nDoesn't apply to minorities so minorities need to be deprived of their Second Amendment rights I I Want the media to ask Michael Bloomberg what other\nConstitutional rights should should minorities be targeted for deprivation I mean the first amendment shouldn't apply to to um Native Americans for example maybe could come down with that one if he decides that they're that they're speaking badly of him\nSo I can you imagine Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren in the debate about constitutional rights\nOr or as a as a pairing of the Bloomberg Warren tickets for the Democrats in twenty twenty yeah that\nThat's that's where we're headed perhaps a anyway he he wants to spend more on police to help take these guns away from uh from from minorities I guess we're going to deprive them of their Second Amendment rights first declared that we're going to deprive them of their constitutional rights then we've got to go use the police to do it [laughter]\nOr they have a third of it is\nThe fact that this is all of a best guess\nDeaths that are as far as the measure heart rate Louis Ross Perot raised by a third\nBecause you're stopping and frisk and I thought liberals didn't like the whole stop and frisk thing because it means you target\nMinorities you know sitting at first but you also mentioned you want to maybe a graph the people that are that are in and provide to the police made me a graph I talk about being in the way back machine anywhere you want to send out this memo to the police were looking for African American males Fifteen to twenty five\nThat I don't know is that\nIt's not like targeting is that like\nA dinner find people by race in going after them specifically target so not only does he want to take away their Second Amendment rights their constitutional rights\nHe wants racial profiling and this is the guy that hosted an event for Phil Bredesen\nAt is fancy New York mansion just a week ago raising money for Phil apparently he used to stop and frisk Phil I'm for for taking a constitutional rights away from minorities Phil I'm for racial profiling has still given the money back\nIt's still denounced racist Michael Bloomberg I haven't heard it if he has\nWell the test these are asked a Phil Bredesen for comment on that guess what we heard back that's exactly right\nEvery day somewhere in the world someone say some of the\nReason why the world's largest way in the old days we hold these people adventurous [laughter] no we called him screamed for the U.S is a group of hell out of Alex ... he's the one hand my walls of fire hall\nIn an effort to save lives we all these people ... voice or either\nHow long will it take you to get from four forty to Murfreesboro time saver traffic immediately after\nFox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three at Fifteen ten W LA scene and now back to the tendencies to report with the bill and Mike lady\nStruggle to figure out what the theme song would be appropriate for a Elizabeth I'm not actually a Native American war and uh the pretend to be in the ... the the\nLie a Jew we uh that yeah the Native American claims of Elizabeth Warren\nThrown out when she subjected herself to a fake DNA testing relieving subject yourself to a DNA test she basically did\nA um a phone call with a geneticist or something who said based upon the percentages of Peruvian Mexican and Latin American blood you you could be point one percent to one point six percent yeah that's a very compelling but zero Native American\nHe didn't even look at our DNA he just got a print it and they had a computer model that just sort of like a global warming\nModel yeah the by the way we're all supposed to be like neck deep in an ocean water here in Tennessee according to Al Gore's\nCalculations by the way if you are heading into Nashville this morning from Clarksville a W Z. T. V. or Fox Seventeen says look for about a two hour plus commute from Clarksville\nAs a twenty four east bound is completely shut down at exit thirty one traffic is a complete standstill so if you're coming in from that direction to Nashville this morning or either\nGo back and have another cup of coffee because you're not going to get here find alternate routes or just stuffed telecommute today because uh the traffic is absolutely beyond horrible looking at a two hour commute\nFrom Clarksville to Nashville normally about a forty five minutes to a to a one hour commute so double that and I'm not sure what's going on there but that's going to wreak havoc throughout the\nThroughout the day in terms of the traffic or New York city this headline from Drudge Report New York city marked the first shooting free weekend in twenty five years um that's kind of a good news bad news thing the first\nShooting free weekend at twenty five years is the good news the bad news is they're just ...\nOr maybe as good as you would think ah the feds have collected a record amount of income taxes in two thousand Eighteen Michael did you see this yesterday that the top one thousand forty earners in America pay more federal income tax\nThan the bottom Seventy\nMillion people in the United states we hear so much from the left saying we need to have a fair share we need to\nHave people pay their fair share well I'd say if if Seventy million people are paying zero in federal income taxes and this would include a lot of people who are here illegally who were not just paying zero in federal income taxes better collecting some bought into the taxpayers yeah if Seventy million people are paying\nLess than a thousand forty or paying taxes that is not a fair distribution edit underlines why\nA lot of people don't have any skin in the game and therefore\nAs Mitt Romney may have pointed out in our tickets at least they don't care about tax cuts because they aren't paying taxes if everybody's paying a little then they're going to be a little bit more concerned with how the federal government spends our money if it's not my money I don't care as much that they're wasting it if it's my money I get a little bit more exercise to buy that\nAnd yet again we've got this horrible I'm distribution problem of a thousand forty people pay more taxes than the bottom Seventy\nMillion people pay\nIn taxes again some of the other topics that we are talking about today Phil Bredesen has ah hooked up to and embraced\nA Michael Bloomberg we've got this uh audiotape we've got a story of Tennessee star dot com of Michael Bloomberg uh oh pining that the solution to our violence in our in our cities is to take away the guns from minorities now getting he didn't specify he wants to take them away from black people but that was clearly the implication\nAlthough if you're going to you know deprive minorities of their Second Amendment rights I'm Hispanic folks he's coming for you\nOr Asian Americans he's come in for you Native Americans he's coming for you what other minorities might be out there he's coming for you and doesn't deserve constitutional rights to be protected in this country this is a guy who's looking at running for president twenty twenty because he's a billionaire and things that makes him smart enough\nTo run the country even though he is clearly disconnected this is the guy that in his speech to the\nAspen Institute not only opined in favor of depriving minorities of their Second Amendment or constitutional rights but also came out apparently in favor of racial profiling I thought that was a no no and uh and and stop and frisk let's just randomly stop people and and check out whether they might be doing something wrong might\nThink about doing something wrong because that means that the Fourth Amendment also doesn't matter\nBut of course a Phil Bredesen disavowed his uh his friend Michael Bloomberg come get\nTo a microphone fast enough to say nothing [laughter]\nBy the way a new report says come out the fundraising faint to report from the FCC we find that Phil Bredesen who has said he's not going to give money to his campaign\nHe was just going to kind of like prime the pump blood well early\nIt provide a little bit for cash flow purposes World War three weeks out and guess how much he's provided for cash for purposes of the fourteen point nine million he's raised he's provided five point four million to his campaign\nFive point for me and just as personal money\nYeah just as personal money but he only has three million cash on hand as opposed to Marsha who has five million cash on hand so if he didn't provide his personal\nOf the energy of the Tea Party movement\nThat drove the the Republican take over the house of representatives and now he ... here we are due to that Fifteen to sixteen he saw that and and he decided to to wrap up the entertainment value of a rally and man he is\nDelivering and its destroyed rallies for political events for I think for all time because when you think of a political candidate\nNow saying we're going to have a rally it's like when you're gonna have two hundred people in an empty you know ... that's not around people think of that conversation Trump rally ten thousand people inside ten thousand people outside watching on big screens because they couldn't get inside people lining up we saw this during the two thousand sixteen election when we were doing lift the vote\nAll over the country people waiting in line for six or seven hours to get inside the facility and then in the last week or so\nYou know Trump would be running for hours behind time they be doing rallies at two o'clock in the morning and nobody would leave", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The TN
