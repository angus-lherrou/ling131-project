W. L. A. B. C. or eight hundred six eight eight W. L. A. C. is we get going thanks for joining us on your commute this morning and\nWe'll get you up to date on ah some of the uh the top stories that are out there for sure uh but they keep saying that the caravan from\nOr the south is growing or the numbers are upwards of five thousand or so now they're saying of migrant or individuals are hitting through Mexico heading toward the southern us border what's gonna happen when they get here\nOr the president has been um [noise]\nIt's been making some comments are about this and uh this could be one of those a flashpoint perhaps before the midterm elections which are just a you know about two weeks away a Michael Patrick Leahy the c._e._o. and editor in chief of the tendency storage here this morning is always a Michael good morning I'll be at a good weekend\nGood morning dug a had a great weekend and I was looking at the videos of that caravan\n[laughter] and it seems to me that there's a little bit of theater going on with that [noise] ah it it looks to me like the Mexican government is pretending to try and stop them uh but doesn't really have a lot of didn't really have their heart into it\nYeah I mean it didn't seem to me like [laughter]\nLike they were working real hard to uh the the stop them or slow them down right I mean and then the other people seem to be getting in line that along with them and also a you know at least some of the videos have the you know people handing ending them what closed insurance and everything else\nYeah well I I saw this one video and we we have the audio coming up here in just a second there's a narrow bridge between Guatemala and Mexico over a river and on the Mexico side apparently some Hondurans who made it\nPast already were were there and they had a message for all of the thousands of Hondurans on the bridge and it sounded like this\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nDone that I'm told in the Honduran national\nAnthem Oh nice [laughter] and now they're fleeing from Honduras because of poverty because of a political repression and yet they're singing the Honduran national anthem\nThis to me look like an invasion of the United states\nWell in it and uh it it's something that you know the I guess it's a few miles every day they're getting closer every day I guess my question is what are we going to do\nOnce they get to the U.S border because you point out Mexico's not doing anything of any significance to to stop this through their country they're they're probably more than willing to just let them get to get a pass and live the United states to deal with this and in one way or the other what do you think is going to happen because I I keep thinking this could be\nA man I think you know I talked about it some last week could be a real a made for TV a situation here that the left is really looking for right if the\nIf this isn't handled in a proper fashion this could be um something because the American people are not going to be um what I mean they're gonna be watching this and not going to be\nReal happy if a if things don't go to the right way on this in in what is the right way you think well this is a purest assaults on the rule of law\nWe have a border and you can't cross it illegally what this group of now you\nHear the numbers I've heard four thousand and then it increased to five thousand just during the news break I heard that it's up to seven thousand so it sounds like apparently a some Mexicans are joining them as they start traveling supposedly on a ... on foot through Mexico\nA because there are so poor and yet they have places to sleep\nThey have food to eat they have shelter um gosh where is that money coming from\nA this seems to me why it is a made for TV movie\nIt's a moment where uh what what you see going on here is it's a complete assault on the rule of law in America\nAnd the question is how do we stop it I think President Trump is now I don't think he's going to hold back I think he's going to figure out where on the board of the going to come and there will be troops there that's what I thought\nYou know and I think uh he's got to be careful on this or you know I keep thinking this could be short of the hurricane Katrina for Donald Trump if uh if he doesn't handle it in the way the American people are going to be satisfied with I don't know how you feel about it but I think it may be the biggest\nObstacle about the mid term elections for Republicans here if um if the optics you know or don't go well we'll talk about it more it's a significant events the numbers are growing and

some people in those groups you got some tough people in those groups and I'll tell you what this country does it want them\nPresident Trump recent rally they're talking about the caravan coming up from the uh the south the talk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen than W. L. A. C. but Tennessee star record the early edition\nA dug in Michael Patrick Leahy here this morning we were just discussing this um it could be a significant or or have some significant impact on the mid term elections perhaps\nAs the American people view what's going on really be a is President Trump got his uh sort of campaign going early on about the you know building the wall dealing\nWith immigration policy that had been a a a you know that people were upset about the fact that so many were allowed to come here illegally with world that are maybe take center stage versus um the sort of the optics of all of this\nThat I guess that's my concern do you have the same concern I have a guy by the way they is going to play this or or what\nNot exactly the same way you do Doug I I I don't think first if you look at that video or taken I think yesterday maybe the day before\nOf a of the Honduran migrants already in Mexico sitting in the Honduran national anthem to the Hondurans on the bridge stuck on the bridge temporarily\nI'm you know if you look at who's in that picture these are basically military age fighting men\nUm most of that a caravan looks to be military age fighting that what I think is gonna happen it's sort of a tick tock time clock thing right\nSo how long does it take to walk from the Guatemala Mexico border\nMichael Honduras Guatemala take responsibility and step up to the plate and stop being so complex set [noise]\nYeah I mean well said right I mean is that do you think it'll be the ... view that Americans are going to see it and that way\nI think so um yeah and of course angel moms ... they're called angel moms to because their children\nHave been killed in the United states by illegal aliens and so they speak that particular angel mom speaks with a great deal of authority my guess is what you're going to see is the further polarization politically of the United\nStates the far left Marxist ... I mean this Democratic Party and can you say that I mean that's where they are right now [laughter] that's where they are right now\nIs that even left in a visit I mean ... yeah ... they're going to attack a president anarchists forward to ...\n... is a more than ... ... more than likely they they like this unrest that's going on eBay but they also receive that these are are those who will be voting for Democrats in the future you bring up a really interesting point I'm just I'm I'm racking my brain to come up with a Democrat\nOr certainly there's not a prominent one that I can think of that the you know that they will be against this right or just these people coming knocking down the doors coming in here I mean I I Can't think of one\nYeah they've been kind of quiet but there'll be for us I think to say something and what are they going to say let them come on in in\nIsrael Bredesen weighed in on this yet [laughter]\nI Know you're not by now know where we haven't heard from several failed but let's get an undercover video and see what his staffers say because then we'll know wildly thinks\nOh well yeah well if you want the truth [laughter] okay we'll be right back ah you're listening to the tendency star before the early edition we'll be right back [noise]\nThe head of the Starr Report early edition with Doug ... and Michael Patrick Leahy\nPluck a women and men to not have that's why I and we should call it out and actually I I just for me as one of many many many ways this president has shown that has not Harry\nPotter not even a well like I don't understand people end up putting a price on taking matters into their own hands and try to sort of stick it out because they can keep things together all the foreign policy front crater a our reputation\nAlright maker Brzezinski you know her from the Morning Joe program MSNBC or talking there a micro bedroom ... CEO editor in chief of the Tennessee stars here Michael uh what is she railing about against Trump this time I mean\nAh you know the latest uh you know she's arguing twenty Fifth Amendment removing the ... that's right I had her dad yet is big Neal Brzezinski was foreign policy advisor to the greatest foreign policy president in history Jimmy Carter not exactly the greatest\n[laughter] yeah I mean you know it's funny that you hear I did hear that\nThe other day where she was railing against and once again calling for the twenty Fifth Amendment ... the you know the President Trump from office but what's amazing to me is the ... off and on that program they will uh say people should resign you know whatever's going on resign immediately resign now then they'll say but we need people in there to keep this president at bay\nAnd the into some which you know which is it the ... people in there\nOr because you think this president's dangerous or do you ah do you want them all to resign so that the what will happen I don't know I never understand the logic behind some of what's going on here if you don't want to give you don't like him right\nSo I have to tell you my Mika Brzezinski story I figured there had to be one here there is an out or or caution warning there is some name dropping going on here okay\n[laughter]\nBut it's not only was it or not that you would do that or not I notice that I had to do that no the right thing but you yeah okay go ahead so I look at what fantasy story\nWho are listening audience that I Am in fact an Ivy League or I have made that we're trying to get past that but I'll Try it passed and the worst anyway the worst of all Ivy League ... at Harvard grad\nUm and uh there are some things that are that come with being a Harvard grad humility is usually not one of those things\nBy the [laughter] you're you know if\nYou figure you know everything and then you get into the real world and if you actually try to start a small business you suddenly realize no there are a lot of smart people out there an awful lot of smart people but if you go and become a lawyer or an investment banker you still think you're the smartest and the world\nSo but one of the benefits as I used to when I was at a at a used to have lunch with a guy by the name of Alan Brinkley who was a PHD grad students\nAre and we you know there was one of these college deals where you sit and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and solve all the problems with the world Oh yes endless endlessly\nBecause we knew how to if we do but anyways Alan Brinkley ... father was David Brinkley of the hungry Brinkley report and and that was the big NBC News a nightly news from Nineteen fifty six to Nineteen sixty nine I think\nDavid Brinkley went on to a host this week with David Brinkley on ABC and did well known in Washington guy\nThe older guys getting a jet\nYeah there isn't a good idea and and good night for NBC News ah that David David Brinkley was a mentor to a Tom Brokaw\nAnd so when the Tea Party started a Alan Brinkley um and ah ah wrote this real nasty piece he's a good guy but he wrote a real nasty piece about the Tea Party and so I hadn't talked to for years he's at Columbia if I were in a minute I 'cause I've been involved in the start of the Tea Party this is I don't two thousand nine or ...\nAs I said you're wrong and I'm like five million levels Alan\nAnd so we had a dialogue back and forth and he was civil he's a very nice guy anyway so he\nEnded up shocked by that but I Know civil is never\nAnyway she introduced me to to broker and so broke on I Would talk back and forth and developed a friendship um over the past decade\nFast forward I I wrote this self published book\nIn two thousand nine called a rules for conservative radicals which is basically took the salt Lewinsky technique and applied it to 'em about politics from a conservative perspective well a guy and the ... I'm like I'm name dropping all over the place here but I have to tell the story so\n[laughter] so the guy at the New York times who's is suppose a conservative David Brooks you know the guy who likes to increase in Obama's pants that guy [laughter]\nSo so he writes a very snarky review of my book I don't even how he got it but it was like filled with snark\nNo is there is a guy who was just starting to be a literary agent with one of the big litter agencies he saw that he called me up several happens by the way and he said hey I'd like to represent new too which I said a sure\nAt least I got to deal with Harper Collins wrote a book called covenant of liberty the ideological or just the Tea Party movement was published as part of the deal I go up to the fly me up to New York city\nI'm a to appear on multiple shows I was on Fox News that's when I first met Brian kill me two thousand twelve and as far as on radio show anyway so one of the deal is so broke I does me a favor\nAnd he gets me literally a twelve minute segment on MORNING Joe this with Mika and with Joe now this was before the make a joke romance was public right [noise]\nUm and so I Walk into the ... and I could tell right away [laughter] the vibe between the two\nThere was something going on\n[laughter] on the panel so there I was being grilled by this panel\nHere you'd you'd parachuted behind enemy lines I've\nI've behind lines and listen listen to the the er the robes gallery of enemy combatants there there's this new Joe Scarborough who's gone further\nI flew traffic center we have traveled out ... just south of ... that's how fourteen to south of shelving of flipped over into somebody's yard sales watch out for the activity going on with us on that fast fourteenth street just south of shell the interstates her main quiet overall but not much is going on for is not a free\nMeal I think I Would hasten time favorite traffic\nThis record is sponsored by the extra Jim temporal scanners thermometer\n[noise] not knowing the difference between talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than double the ... the head of the sorrow for early edition with John Kelly and Michael Patrick Leahy and welcome back five fifty one science in the ... early edition\nThe deal joined the show coming up right after the news at six o'clock you're on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W. L. A. C. good to be with you hear a check out the the leader stories tendencies start dot com you had your news headlines sign up for the daily emailed last uh into your email box tendencies star\nDot com is a story up there about that I Know\nWe talked about this the briefly last week but the uh the mega jak but uh I don't know it's gotten your interest yet Michael adjusted will be one point six billion dollars by tomorrow now uh I Know that is that going to entice you perhaps maybe just a the venture into this and you\nKnow I I Will never ever ever pays the tax [laughter] that's exactly\nWhat it is the odds of winning one in three hundred two million [noise]\nUm I was just looking at the ... of the story got posted on the tendency started the uh apparently Fifteen people got the five numbers right they just didn't get the the mega mall a number but they still got a million bucks out of it I guess you know one time I uh the last time I just got way up there\nI stopped that the grocery store and I asked my wife just just gives the lotto ticket you know [laughter] and they're just you know it always comes back with all these lotto tickets I said wait a minute how many did you get up okay [laughter]\nI said wait a minute you blew a hundred bucks on this\nI just wanted one you know I mean the chance of winning one and three hundred and to make it I mean come on\nOne of the average between one and three hundred and two million and one in three thirty million ah gosh tell me it's got to be ten times drier [laughter]\nSo they don't go to Harvard I didn't have that ivy leagues that holiday or are they are bad but that\nHere's the thing when you look at these crazy a public policy to me I think a lotteries across your cup of policy era now I'm doing it but I'm doing it for the schools are doing it for the ... right yeah I've heard about ... come up so they are what are our lead story today at at the kind of see star\nTaxpayers band one point two million for the Nashville connector and what that is it's a PR campaign to get people to a ride share downtown Nashville it's not a good good use of one point two million dollars\nWell sure I mean that's advertising right or whatever um well yeah I mean the idea to get people to car pool well yeah like I don't know how to do that on their own I guess\nApparently not and I'm really in Nashville is it's just not a it's just not a city design work car pooling makes any sense\nAt all uh but let's go has been one point two million dollars on it because we don't you know we don't have anything else to spend at one point two million dollars on like oh I don't know raises for a a a employees of the city now when I was raised their police officers nope can't do that\nBut I like is they'll spend money like this for just a study on the idea and I always wanted to get into the study\nLike that area of study right exactly\nYou know I always I thought that's the job or are they the business to have is is ...\nDrag their people back and and if I think Mexico is understanding that this president is serious they've dealt with him before Guatemala Honduras not so much but uh\nI think they understand that this president is deadly serious when he says he will pull the plug on on financial aid\nAnd and stop the funding going into Mexico so they're at least dispatching troops down there to pretend they're trying to stop them and yet they have to they have to cross all the way across Mexico and and you're telling me that they can't let me just start peeling off the slow walkers at the back and trucking them back\nTo the border you know I think there are a bunch of pretended [laughter] well obviously they have the same DNA ads or your microbes turned off somehow they're\nThey have the same DNA as a they have the same DNA that you'll have microphones on ... percent whatever their technical difficulties technical difficulties they have the same DNA as a a along with one one thousand twenty fourth\nShe'll be down at the border welcoming them with open arms because she sees a not Seventy two hundred invader she sees Seventy two hundred new Democratic Party voters\nThey're probably already registered they've probably been voting absentee out of the Democratic party yeah uh and now they're just having your finger he look we've been voting why can't we come there and and they're not making any pretense they're coming here to take jobs from Americans and I think the president is is making it clear and and Republicans need to hammer this home\nDemocrats care more about illegal aliens than they do American workers they're they're wanting these people to take jobs from Americans and they and we keep being told well they are taking the jobs that Americans won't do 'em\nThat's not the case you know you've got a lot of really good paying construction jobs for example people would do those jobs if they weren't able to pay about five dollars a person per hour less than what they would pay American workers and I've I've used this example in the construction industry before\nThey're using illegals because they can make more money they can make a bigger profit by breaking the law and I'm Talking about the employers in this case\nWe wouldn't tolerate I don't think\nIf the same employers were saying you know we can use substandard last lumber we can use substandard electrical wire and and make bigger profits I don't think we would say will will tolerate that kind of illegal behavior so you can make bigger profits and yet that's exactly what they're doing when they're hiring illegal\nAliens to save money and to keep Americans out of work and I think the two\nThe two phrases that the Trump in the Republican Steve to hammer home is jobs not mobs because I think that one's going to work in the visual of what we're seeing you know ... cents at home\nAnd then the other is that the Democrats care more about illegals than they do American vets than they do about American workers than they do about American citizens and certainly more than they care about American taxpayers\nJobs but not mobbed with a visual example of a mob coming up through Mexico right now seven thousand to them and growing\nAnd and I'm not hearing any ... any calls by the by the Democrats and let's have a an emergency session in the U.S house and pass the funding for the wall in fact you've got an anti below sea saying we will not build the wall and if you need any understanding of why we need the wall watched them climbing fences fences don't work\nThey may make for good neighbors but we don't have good neighbors we've got bad neighbors south of us\nAnd it's time to build a wall and keep people from invading our country will talk more about it in ... Tennessee started [noise]\nAfter news from five ... on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W. I. Lacey [noise]\nAnd now back to the Tennessee ... with the jail and Mike Lee [noise]\n\n\n\nEver comeback into says the Tennessee star reports the bill and Michael Patrick Leahy with you we were talking about that a march towards America the trail of take our stuff as we've dubbed\nA trip to take our stuff where the Mexican government is wink wink trying very hard to stop them from going through Mexico\nI think I think the president should impose a ten percent tax on any wire transfers of money you know Wells Fargo anything else to Mexico it would bring in about thirty billion dollars a year in New tax revenue and that we could build the wall again with their money and start construction right now all it would take would be Congress feeling of a need to expedite\nThe the need for a wall and again as you see people climbing a fence it underlines why a wall is is needed because offense doesn't work and and you've got some folks that are actually saying it's time for the U.S military\n... to do live fire delivery fire into these crowds now again you're going to have some dead babies are gonna have some dead women that's the only thing that the\nUh that's what the media will conference with the shooting for let her know finding ... but but uh\nYou start seeing some live bullets fly that way I think you'd see seven thousand head south after the new same boat can run a hundred yard dash [laughter]\nWell\nAnd and it'll stop the next Seventy thousand\nWell that's the key I mean Newt Gingrich talked about that this this is going to be this caravan is the first of many if they are allowed to enter the country this is an assault on the rule of law and they're really literally thumbing their nose at at the United states of America say oh they're not even\nMaking a pretense now they're they're seeking\nRefuge or sanctuary because of their their fears and their own countries hey go back to your country and fix it\nFight in your country to fix it don't come take our stuff and take our jobs you know the bottom line is they're coming for one reason or there was one lady that the NBC ethic interviewed they didn't expect this she admitted she left her six children home\nIt or will he dispatch troopers and ice you know do we have enough of those plastic handcuffed to arrest the entire crowd and and what will the media what will the frenzy of left wing oh we have to let them in we have to be compassionate I I'm always struck by the Democrats what would Jesus do but they never asked\nWhat would Jesus do as they abort babies they never ask what would Jesus do is they they force bakers to bake cakes for lesbian marriages and gay marriage as they only care about what would Jesus do when they're saying well Jesus said to take care of the polar\nJesus said take care of the poor with your money not taking my money to give it to who you want to give so you can get more voters seven three seven nine five to two seven three seven W. L. A. C. eight hundred\nSix eight eight W. L. A. is if you want to join us on the phone lines what what should President Trump do and and the media is already playing this as isn't it isn't it time we gave sympathy and compassion to these folks who are trekking across the desert to come here like migrants before\nNot when migrants came here before they were coming when we needed workers when we needed those bodies due to build 'em the infrastructure of our country and they were they were coming to become Americans\nThey weren't singing their Italian songs in their German songs in their polar songs ... as they were on the boats pulling into Ellis Island they were coming here to become Americans\nNot to come and instill their values or lack of values here these are sort of the most dangerous and violent countries in the world\nAnd some of the most dangerous and violent men in those countries are coming to our country and we've seen what happens when these illegal aliens come here whether it's the rape of our moms are sisters our daughter's weather is the the brutal crimes the murders that we've seen taking place at the hands of these illegal aliens yeah let's bring in tens of thousands more\nShould the u._s. put military on the border right now to make it clear you're not coming in and if we have to use tanks to roll over here if we have to have Tiananmen Square to send the message this isn't gonna work so that the next Seventy thousand don't hit this way\nIs that the collateral damage like Nancy Pelosi was talking about hurting innocent or men and women Americans in order to promote the Democratic party cause and she's down with that is this just the collateral damage we need to secure our border seven three seven nine five to two\nThis caravan emphasizes the new apparently the new apparent democratic thing they don't want to make America great again they want to make America like Honduras\nMake America Guatemala again that's the that's the same again the Democrats mobs not jobs\nAnd Republicans need to drive that home and and you've got this choice are we going to be a country that puts Americans first puts our American workers first are we going to continue to put illegal aliens illegals ahead of Americans that's what the Democrats have been doing that's what they want to keep doing and and it's it's up to us\nTo speak up and speak out and make sure that our politicians are speaking up and speaking out God Bless Marsha Blackburn\n... what is she saying about this what is she demanding as action and of course we know filled reticence going to be down at the border welcome them with with an open embrace\nStanding right between Chuck Schumer for e books [noise]\nTo the Tennessee ... with the tail and Mike Lee\n\nComeback into says the tendency star reports the bill and Michael Patrick Leahy here with you we were talking in the last\nSegment about this uh this march towards America by these ah Seventy two hundred ten thousand\nGuatemalan Honduran illegal immigrants who claim of some of them claim that they're they're just seeking sanctuary they're seeking asylum from the dangers of their own home countries and yet they're you know those that have crossed and climbed the fence is illegally into Mexico\nUm there there safely out of their countries\nThey're not coming to America to seek asylum they're coming to America to take jobs from Americans to take money from American taxpayers and to illegally enter our country illegally hide in our country they will disappear into our country a ... if they get across the border with our catch and release policies that the Democrats have held in place in the liberals\nIn the courts have put in place because the rule of law doesn't matter\nAnd yet some like Janine bureau Fox News or or speaking it and telling it like it is both in terms of what the mob is and who's funding it\nLet me be clear\nWhen you cross the border into these legal aid to rest and\nYou do have the right pick out in the air we did we like to hear you can stay here and I think the Democrats George Soros and they were a lot that's kind of hair and why why why everyone else Arlene where I Need to face that Terry\n[noise] so where you came from\nAnd and by the way the president needs to follow through on his threat to take money take all aid I mean zero it out to Guatemala Honduras and and if any other country participates in this zero out American aid because we're going to need to pay for all those bus tickets driving them south\nPushing them back south to their countries the American taxpayers shouldn't have to pay to send these people home Guatemala and Honduras should pay the price of not getting a dollar more not one dime more\nOf American aid in any form or fashion amber not just whoa until they stop this until they stopped the next\nAmber\nThey need to make it clear that this will be a perpetual policy of shutting them down if they think they've seen poverty before they're going to see it in spades if the American taxpayer isn't supporting them they can either fix their country\nAnd follow the American blueprint or suffer the consequences because American taxpayers don't need to pay for them and Mexico needs to be taking note as well\n\nStart charging ten percent tax on every dollar that gets wired back to Mexico from this country a bit about thirty billion dollars a year into the coffers of the U.S government we can build a wall with the first thirty billion\nAnd then pay for these ah I'm exporting of illegals back to Mexico and places south with the money that will generate from Mexican trying to send money home to their to their uh their ...\nDown south now the victims of this illegal immigration caravan are are are long and the list is long and it is tragic\nAmericans who've been killed raped robbed by those illegally in our country and there's a group\nCalled angel moms who you saw on the campaign trail with Donald Trump who are those whose whose brothers and sisters and parents\nChildren has been killed by illegal aliens and they're speaking up there speaking up against what this caravan is bringing to this country because they've paid the ultimate price where the here's one angel mom telling us what we need to do to save our children\nNeed to shed a lawyer is down a ... and then they don't let any of them and we don't know who they are they are not that and how many of the uh how many criminals are amongst them we need to focus on the millions that are already here costing taxpayers ... millions and millions of dollars a year in housing and education\nAnd medical and everything else that they get\nA we need to focus on those guys that are held in prison draining our resources enough is enough I think it's about time that Mexico Honduras Guatemala take responsibility and step up to the plate and stop being so complex that\nYou know the bottom line is we we don't need to deport the eleven to twelve to twenty million illegals who are in this country we didn't import them we didn't bring them in we don't need to deport them\nIf we make it absolutely clear that you will not be able to work because we're going to start punishing employers that break the law\nIf we make it absolutely clear you will not get housing you will not get healthcare you will not get the benefits on the back of the American taxpayers they will go home the same way they got here because if they can't get housing if they can't eat and if they can't work there is no benefit to being here\nWe've made it beneficial to be here\nIf we cut off the benefits they'll find their way home the same way they found their way here\nSeven three seven nine five to do that seven three seven Ninety five twenty two you can also a singer comments be emails the bill show a Gmail dot com and let's go next to the phone lines and Patricia an international you're next on the ascendancy Starr Report the morning\nI get annoyed him I guess talk show or a non highly impressed with that um [noise]\nI'm a little and I found that ... is our whole family around magazine on the Internet there are a lot of those people coming into our country or in the world get all those people come from\nWell they're coming from Honduras and Mexico and Guatemala and they're being encouraged them on there is actually photos and videos of them being handed cash there they are being helped along not stopped at the border of Mexico the southern border of Mexico where they should have been stopped there climbing fences there pushing through and the police aren't doing anything to stop them\nUm again it's about seven thousand people now heading this way and it'll grow to ten and that's interesting Patricia and one of the things that they're saying is it only God can stop us now\nAnd interestingly there's hurricane Willa that's pouring into Mexico right in the path of this of this caravan of chaos headed to the u._s. so ... maybe a hurricane will stop them and and blow them by south\nAnd maybe we ought to use some of the same tactics we used George drug dealers you you bring in a bunch of drugs in an automobile or a plane or a boat we confiscate the boat what if we go out and started saying that the new rules going to be you employ illegals at your place of business you just lost your factory you've lost your office building [noise]\nYou just lost your stuff if they get caught driving a truck that you know he just lost that truck [noise] you see some employers getting serious about actually betting their employees and if illegals can't work they will go home [noise] we'll talk more about uh seven three seven nine five to do the ... the star\n\n... all time favorite traffic immediately after Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and fifty that W ... [noise]\nBack to the Tennessee report with the jail and Mike Lee [noise]\nRebecca Davis is the tendency Starr Report [noise] gotta tendencies star dot com Tennessee star dot\nCom you'll find links to some of the stories that we're talking about today also\nYou can now joined us on the phone lines it's seven three seven nine five to two seven three seven W.

T. president dot com\nWe've got the the fly us to president caps Donald Trump the fly US President as dubbed by Kanye West that a lot of people say what does fly us I mean it's like it's like it's like you know when you say he's bad that means he's good flyers is like the greatest\nYet Kenya used three terms to talk about President Trump the flyers president the freshest president and the dope ... president\nAre good they're they're the equivalent of great right on the great make America fly again deck America great again think of it that way\nSo we've got these red caps have Trump in big bold letters and then the flyers president ... looked like the mega cap and then these are the first round has the tendency try star in in white\nLetters on on the red cap it it's it's a great looking cab you could see it at the fly us or at blast president dot com blast president dot com check it out and that right there you can send an email and order\nOne of these guys they're only Fifteen bucks and I had somebody say you have to well they kept for made in China it's like yes but they were embroidered and sold by Tennessee her message business I don't know why these liberals hate Americans and hate American business\nSo if you want to fly as president cat go to fly as president dot com oh you have to do is there's a place right there to fill out your email address fill your email out and they will will contact you and make all the arrangements to get your ass\nYeah again when I tried to make a bunch of money out of this I mean that we're we're just trying to basically break even on these things\nWe had a number that called us and emailed us last week and we'll be shipping goes out to early this week so yeah if you if you emailed us it's on his way\nThere must be that's going to cost you like twenty five bucks if you're on line or somewhere by and by and a political hats Fifteen bucks because we're just we're trying to take\nWhat I like about it what I like about that is it it really a it's a conversation starter and the question is ... what do you mean flashed\nSo you think Kanye West is a good guy it's like yeah he's a billionaire black guy who's willing to speak up against the uh the plantation of the Democratic party and then double ACP saying oh if you're black you have to ... you have to tow the line and tell you and say what we want you to say\nThat's not America it's not it's not going to make America great again to have folks and having to do a political line dispensed by one political\nParty you know what it was funny seeing you know when he was in this the White House with Jim Brown and suddenly actually and it went on this twenty minute a tirade was sort of fascinating\nWatching Jim Brown with the best part is I was sitting there bemused going what the heck am I in the middle [laughter]\nBut what's interesting is here is a highly successful black entrepreneur promoting the policies of President Trump\nAnd then there's all of these liberals you know liberal or a journalist and Washington going tut tut tut you know how dare he white liberals right taking an African American\nI was gonna say let's do not ask a button I because I looked there there may have been\nA journalist there who was white I didn't see them and the pictures\nAre but the contrast between as you say white liberal journalists going ... ... ... ... talk to a guy a black guy from Chicago\nWho I don't think started out with a lot of money who figured out how to make money who is promoting the economic policies of Donald Trump and saying you know\nBlack Americans take a look at this guy what do we got some lose\nLowest unemployment in since they've been ... in recorded history basically among African American same thing among Hispanic Americans\nSo it's the policies are working it's not that he's just\nKind of being a sink a fat for Trump he's pointing out these policies are helping the African American community and when you look at the city is that the Democrats have been running for so long using their Democrat liberal policies look at Chicago look at Detroit look at inner city Washington DC looked at Oakland look at at the\nAt the the the portions of Los Angeles where democratic leadership has been put in place they break places beyond repair and and the only thing that's working in this country or where Democrats aren't running the economic show why would we put them in charge\nOf the whole country by the way one of the other ideas in terms of dealing with this caravan of thousands and thousands of illegals headed due to America is to simply shut down the border I don't mean just shut it down to legals\nShut it down to I don't let a truck come over bringing one one avocado don't let one more green bean come from you know field than in Mexico don't let car parts don't let cars\nShut it down no visitors if you're an American you can come home if you have a passport you can come home across the border but if you're not\nAn American citizen running home returning home yeah I don't care if you're the billionaire Mexican you're not coming across the border into the United states you're not going to be granted a travel visa to come into the United states\n... we will shut down the complete border with Mexico and after about thirty minutes of seeing a line of trucks of of ... of Mexican products trying to get into the U.S you'd see that the Mexican government begging and pleading for for a solution and the solution is to stop that caravan\nStopped that chairman and stop your people from coming across the border legally shut down the border not just shut it down to illegals not just block this caravan shut down the border completely and he said Mexico decide maybe they can that maybe they can do a little more than they're doing\n... Steve the Mexican government is trying so hard to stop that care of it I mean you know look at look at all they've done to stop them so far it's they watched they want they they let them climb over the fence is they let them I don't really take these inner tubes of ... across the river they didn't try very they didn't try at all to stop them\nThere there's a I mean to put put dogs down on the border I mean these Marilyn was there something that's called mallet gators I mean they they chop down on your on they're not going to let go let me start start showing that you are going to secure the southern border and return this caravan home because the next one will be Seventy thousand by\nThe way speaking of Seventy thousand President Trump is hosting a rally in Texas they've had to move the facility like two or three times to accommodate the crowd over a hundred thousand people are saying they want to come to this this rally with President Trump for a for Ted Cruz they're going to turn it into a giant tailgate\nPeople have been lined up Michael for ten hours all ready for the event tonight they're going to be waiting in line for twenty four hours to make sure they get in we keep hearing about this blue wave I don't see a hundred thousand people saying they want to come here Joe Biden in fact the Joe Biden and President Trump revoked in Vegas\nPresident Trump attracted about eight or ten thousand people to the middle of nowhere Nevada [noise]\nThe fact that a hundred and Seventy three [noise]\nThat brings up but again often ... these are people not coming\nAnd waiving American flags wanting to be Americans although I won't be surprised visually that they don't start handing out little American flag at some point to make it look like oh they're coming to immigrate and become Americans know they're marching with their Guatemalan flags singing their Guatemalan anthem\n[laughter]\n\nAlso very patriotic very American and I speak easy to dance to you know if I was on a\n... you know you'll be a star you know one of those ... you know reality singing shows I think there are a little ... you know that\n[laughter] but uh you know it it it's a decent song it's just not an American weren't any Sopranos are also in the chorus no that that's guys singing\nBass bass Senate Bob and loves base at us and I didn't hear a cigarette I see you're a single female voice in that you just need those on the very front of the line when the cameras were there and well\nWhere in at seven Fifteen we're going to be speaking with Craig surely the Reagan biographer NPR expert we're going to ask him a little bit about how the the the uh public relations of this plays out because these this army is likely to be on the border\nProbably now looks like they're headed towards California Arizona border or the day before the midterm elections gee how convenient\nAnd again this is being a being used I guess to to try and motivate that the Latino and Hispanic voters to say yeah we need to stand together and and support our brothers and sisters from Guatemala and Honduras I I don't think that's how it's going to play\nAnd I certainly don't think that's how it's going to play when you look at flyover country America that is looking at the visuals of this invading army of ten of what will be seven to ten thousand and the next round will be Seventy two hundred thousand people marching north into our country and I do have an idea where\nI got it got can't wait to hear this\nYou don't gang violence you know it's like the crypts and the blood you know if you're wearing a red bandana you go into the area that's the crypt or you were in a blue crypts bandana go into the\nTo the blood area in LA I mean you and you've got these gangs are spreading all over the country in fact that channel twos could be doing a big detailed story on gang violence in Nashville and how it's risen over the next week\nWhat if what if we just distributed red bandana to everybody marching in this group\nAnd then put the put the crypts on the border\nOh they won't make it in [laughter]\nNot gonna happen by the way speaking of not making it in the uh the University of Tennessee um football often didn't make it into the end zone very often ah and ah at the end of the game the titans couldn't make it into the end zone in jolly old England\nAs they as they went for the when I Do admire going for the win but I don't understand why they didn't you know crush it through I mean they had had a penalty they got half the distance of the goal and the titans decide\nTo [noise] to lose rather than simply for the fight for the victory with their running back maybe\nBush will do the live so far reinforced not benefiting nine and seven last you\nKnow and that's not so much when we come back ... surely joined us Reagan biographer Newt Gingrich biographer PR expert he'll give us some insights into how President Trump from a PR standpoint to handle this era vein of chaos [noise]\nLike fun here make account\nFlexibility is good endorsements I paid actors\nIs president Donald Trump called feel British\nWas recorded by Sheila do run for this\nDonated a lot of
