they're sort of view I guess there's a new twist on Michelle Obama's\nWhen they go low we go high Well Eric Holder's is when they go low we kick him huh [laughter] the advocating violence\nOr something and you're not getting any bubble against yeah how is that where you are is the new Democrats civility\n[noise] yeah Oh yes well we want to be civil Hillary Clinton said this week that you can't be civil Republicans [laughter]\nSo I tell if you put all put Hillary Clinton's comments together with Eric Holder's comments I think what that means is let's keep ... kicking Republicans until [laughter] the Democrats take either the house or the Senate\nThen you stop All right I mean that and [laughter] you know that's like by old adage when I was in you know in school and everything when the bully start picking on yet but you could get him on the ground I just keep picking regularly I mean he he gave him down your way to get back up and it seemed like Eric just wants to get Republicans down and like you're saying a and hope that the Democrats win and\nAnd somehow stop 'em in the ground here you know it's ah you're right civility I guess has gone out the window but it's not the Republicans that are have not been civil about things that\nIt's ah the same old group it's the old Democrat Party that seems to you know or or be doing their polarization although Phil Bredesen wants to solve all that you've probably heard that last night\nOr in the Senate debate or right I mean it's a it's another sort of a let's just sort of get along the beach I guess it's kind of the way I Would put it\nSo so let me ask you this question to if the leaders of the Democratic party\nAre now are saying and and obviously Phil Bredesen is part of the Democratic party he is not the national leader he would be considered leader here in Tennessee and he said nothing a as said nothing to counter\nWhat the leaders of the party are saying if the leaders of the Democratic party are saying\nWe need to be kicking Republicans until we take control of the house or Senate let me pose this question to you [noise]\n... let's let's suppose they take control of the house or the Senate and it's January of two thousand Nineteen [noise] do you think they're going to stop kicking Republicans\nNo as far as I can say they never had right I mean that's a ... the capital what right wasn't wasn't kick of course not just they'll step it up it will be\nWill be like a warp drive a the use of Star Trek reference ride though just to go to the next level of course and and British it will be this is it goes back to what we're talking about the\nWhen you're ... you're part of the plan when you if you get in there and uh you want to play a politics in Washington and play any role or you're going to have to go along with them and doing all that\nYou know my friend Craig Shirley who is the Reagan biographer I saw him on Laura Ingraham last night and she asked them you know what's your assessment\nOf the current political situation and he said you know the Democratic party is promoting in essence the French Revolution\nOf the twenty first century in a in an attempt to tear down every institution of society or the Supreme Court the Senate the presidency\nA marriage family that's what you're saying they want to hear all these institutions down and then rebuild a quote better society what is it is that\nI guess Eric Holder's should've said let them eat cake or am I right I mean it's it's amazing because uh they have attacked every\nInstitution I mean the law enforcement you know the the rule of law now they say the Supreme Court as illegitimate so every decision that comes down apparently they are going to a dispute because they say that it it has no validity because of Kavanaugh's\nAppointment to the court Nancy Pelosi said this week that uh they just be done to attack Kavanaugh\nUm we've not seen really open war against it but Supreme Court justice once they were on the court uh in my memory or if if we have certainly not in a long time really by one party or whatever based on ideology but that's that's kind of what's going on here so they're going to attack attack attack now when they get in\n... ah to power again and it will happen whether it's mid term elections or sometime in the future because that's just kind of the way things go with politics they swing back and forth when that happens they're going to want people to respect the rule of law to a certain degree right they're going to want the the idea of these institutions working\nAt least for their benefit anyway so uh you're right I mean if you continue to attack them then we have nothing really depend depend on the constitution as we talked about before is nothing more than ... document that\nWas a nice idea way back when but it's just the you know some or something that some old guys got together with\nWell you know the Google executives apparently have a

Tennessee report the early edition dug in Michael this morning and uh I Would just be women asking just sort of a point of interest about the\nHurricane Michael it hit the pan handle it was the strongest it hit the pan handle it a hundred and fifty five miles an hour but it's not the strongest are on record a there are it's like number four on the list the strongest as a Labor Day storm before they even name storms back in Nineteen thirty five and a hundred and eighty five\nMiles an hour sustained wins and then on the uh the barometric pressure this is from Janice deemed by the way the Fox news channel it was number three it ... it it was a means storm and uh we're just now seeing some of the the damage along\nA Panama City Mexico beach apparently took the brunt of this so anyway we'll have more details interviews in weather updates as we go on this morning the deal will joined the program I guess without trigger warnings or those free speech trigger warnings they do on the college campus uh because uh\nYou know if you if you say any they're about to say something that might be considered to be a\nA just a bit offensive to some and that can be just about anything on the left I could say wow big Lindsey Graham's doing a great job you know and all of a sudden you've got to have a a trigger\nWarnings about this when a major [noise] how 'bout that every time we say something you're you're there you go [laughter] that sounds like the old to be where it is it is I was just started to come up with something very good this is a low budget programs are certainly they pushed puts us\nBack and that was Nineteen sixties a television program it was ... [laughter]\nYeah exactly uh but um anyway so uh the will be along in a\nA it is amazing with this whole idea about free speech but when you listen and in this project ... video or that came up last night and you've got the full story about it at Tennessee star dot com is a you know here it is a again these campaign workers what what amazes me about that\nI Am is not OK well first of all that they're talking that he's saying one thing privately and in telling the public something else or but it is that they think that's that's doing good work\nI mean that that is that's doing the right thing I Believe is the way they\nYell at you as you listened to the audio and video watch video Doug as you point out you hear that phrase from these you know it kind of twenty year old types yeah mid twenties your old workers they all say you know what he'll do the right thing when he gets her in other words\nIt's okay for him to lie\nAbout what he will do because when he gets there he will do quote the right thing which is you know to promote far left policies far left policies that apparently these reticent campaign workers support I mean you're you're right it's one of the lack of moral character or on their part\nRight and they didn't you know he didn't just learning that the other day this you can carry this around by bright well I'll just tell you what you want to hear a isn't that the worst form of flattery we've heard growing up that if you tell somebody or what they want to hear but you really don't mean it\nAnd I tell a friend or something like that um eventually the truth is going to come out\nUh enter your not being a bearing through to them you're not doing the right thing that's that's not the way you do the right thing is it just uh it's just another indication right of um the way some people will be you know their role in politics but don't you know these people are probably going to run for something at some point\nOr another right that's right well they don't you think though it's it's more it's also a reflection on the entire\nA problem with our educational culture because\nDSM campaign workers they appear to be somewhere in their twenties or recent college graduates they're their products of public schools mhm where they are all talk to sort of give the right answer you notice that you see all these independent thinking a\nLeft wing socialist of\nMillennials who are apparently out there\nUm that they all think the same way because they've gone to high school elementary schools and high schools and colleges where\nAh they're basically taught to give the right answer to ... whatever the propaganda line isn't that line unfortunately is now far left socialism\nIt's indoctrination camps pins room was what it is\nAnd certainly trying to make up those points ... ... what what points is she talking about their well uh we have a couple of points in polls you know there there have been numerous polls on this last\nMonth or you'd have kind of polls bouncing back and forth some of the polls show that ah Marsha Blackburn was ahead some show that Phil Bredesen was ahead our own tendency star a poll done\nAnd released about three weeks ago showed Marcia had a three point lead well guess what's happened with the polls on Sunday ... released by the CBS that showed marsh now has an eight point lead fifty to forty two and then yesterday\nYesterday the New York times released a poll that showed Marcia has an eight point lead fifty seven percent to thirty nine percent over\nPhil Bredesen now I I Know that the New York times poll had a six percent margin of error so I'm not exactly sure that I Believe that we'll see how the other ones go but clearly internally that Brett is in campaign as\nSeen that that that he's trailing\nMarcia and so in a very craven way they they put his put his finger up in the window and saw which way the wind was blowing this a reticent campaign worker clearly said and I've got the quote here exactly this is what the president campaign worker told the undercover journalist quote Seventy four\nPercent of Tennesseans wanted to see Kavanaugh confirmed so uh I like logically based on those numbers and and what I've seen is that he'd already know that that gap between him and her has grown more and so he's not just you know just to get more boats he'll say\nThat uh he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh but you know\nThat's a debate last night holy cow you Marcia uh I I think yeah I think maybe Lindsey Graham ah came came into Tennessee last night I mean he had a pre game meal with Marsha because she was really really\nA very effective in putting Bredesen\nOn the defensive and you know she went right after that yeah\nWe don't really believe what you're going to say and then of course we we don't believe you when you say you would have confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh and ... you know\nI we manage foreign labor in Malaysia and Vietnam reticent got rich taxpayers foot the

I get that to me is is worthy of an investigation how many people have been placed in these congressional offices who are being paid by somebody we don't know that don't show up on the\nOn the pay scale on the payrolls we don't know their background we don't know who they are they're being brought into and given access to government secrets\nBeing paid by outsiders and and apparently the same things happening at the bill Bratton some campaign where people are baby being paid by George Soros organization\nBut we do know that I Am parent groups who knows and they're over there working free uh this this one kid that featured a regularly will Stewart\nHarm your way to conduct file darn Hillary\nBy two times every plenty of the ... the the third phrase\nMiss out on the phone darn jewelry now\nI teach I get one free ... and that's one of her for a very nice article by a third\nHannity on Fox News talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than\nAnd now back to the Tennessee report with the bill and Mike Lee [noise]\nNew York's looking for a third senator or with a with Phil Bredesen he was up there a yesterday or day before you even though yesterday raising money with Michael Bloomberg the um the anti gun guy Michael Bloomberg well Phil Bredesen in\nThe late not Marsha ... gotten as no he's not one of them you know the video is you got this great big townhouse in New York City\nMichael Bloomberg the former mayor who now is just registered as Democrats probably gonna run for president put twenty million dollars into gun control efforts that many of the big SUV a ride with Phil Bredesen and he walks in and it\nDoesn't take any question just goes right after the big money people and ... for gun control money [laughter]\nPlanned Parenthood money you've got to get that if I were fairly money Chuck Schumer money uh but you know he's independent that\nWants to ah get get the uh the circus atmosphere the chaos the [laughter] the ... out of Washington that we've seen lately and it's like\n... people who were doing that you vote for you puts those people who are doing this in charge I mean that's\nThat's the bazaar aspect of this campaign by the way if you're if you're just catching up with us you you need to go to Tennessee star dot com we have a lead story on a project Vera toss video\nWhere they have an inside the ... campaign headquarters video of about four and a half minutes of Bredesen campaign staffers and we're not talking about just you know the ... somebody stuffing envelopes\nLaid it out or that it was just a political move a ... in order to make up those points on the pole where they're going down you know you get what office she worked for here in for mayor make and bury the office of new Americans oh this\nIs so so that their voter security may actually be targeting a new Americans who are not active\nPhysical therapy ... even\nWhen I got to take a cab\nI think we have a nice around it's like to play\n...\n[noise] [noise]\nWe understand the minerals pro help we created an online caregiving resource center at ... dot org slash caregiving confined resource to come up with a character in community\nGarden we can better care for our phone lines were long\nLegal ... dot org slash can't get to learn more public service announcement ... are ... on the council\nHow long will it take you to get for Mallory lane to Madison Time saver traffic follows Fox News on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen then W. L. A. C.\nAnd now back to the Tennessee ... with the tail and Mike [noise]\n\n[noise] and looking\nBack into says the Tennessee star reports the bill Michael Patrick Leahy here with you this morning seven three seven nine five to to the number seven three seven W. L. A. C. eight hundred six eight eight W. L. A. C. uh Phil Bredesen and Marsha Blackburn had their big debate last night I thought\nThat I thought Phil did it did a good job I I thought again he was still low energy Phil\n... was still kind of bumbling and Bob around with the\nWith the um debate process of of you know either he was portraying himself as shocked when when Marshall would point out his record and criticize him for his record versus what he is pretending to be\nA buddy of cows before golden and confused by the fact well how dare you say something like that where this is supposed to be kind and gentle a debate and yet you look at the attack ads that he and his cronies like well Michael Bloomberg and others are are throwing at at Marsha Blackburn that the\nThat the uh Chuck Schumer who he pretends I I don't even know juncture I'm not supportive of Chuck Schumer really you're you're not going to help put Chuck Schumer empower along with Spartacus Booker and Elizabeth Warren and the rest of the looney crazies we've seen on parade in his closing\nHe talked about the fact that that we need to to get away from the lack of civility and yet this is the guy that gave forty four thousand dollars to miss we should be uncivil until we get power Hillary Clinton so\nFrom the standpoint of of his performance he performed as a kindly uncle Phil likeable guy until you look at the words and what he says that just is not is not supported by the truth\nAnd then Marshall Black but I thought again the attire we talked the first debate where she was worst sort of a tan students have kind of washed her out I thought uh both of them looked very good I thought the stage looked great\nI I think Marcia came right out of the box you know being aggressive\nI think she overplayed the Hillary Clinton handed I think a reticent did point that out at the end that\nI didn't think it was possible to use a person's name that's not on the stage more often than you did Chuck Schumer and the first debate but you've outdone yourself with references to Hillary Clinton\nAnd I think that one of the one of the reasons that Marcia comes off as scripted is because she goes to the same talking point time and time again and I think there were other ways to have brought up maybe other liberal extremists who are backing Phil Bredesen clearly part of their agenda was to tie him to a Hillary Clinton\nWhich we we kind of been advising for about six months that celery should've been how they should have been branding him and and tying him to the Hillary Clinton apparently they've decided that's what they want to do and and she was hammering at home last night so I think both of them did what they needed to do\nI don't think you'd move the dial one iota\nI don't think it's a debate that but what what I thought it was interesting is right after the debate like ten minutes after the debate ended the project ... video hit\nWe had our story up ten minutes later and they're they are British and campaign workers saying you know he's kind of lying about pretty much everything that cannot confirmation no you really wouldn't do that a Donald Trump they really hates them um so now ... on the phone Bill Bryson ... you know\nHe's not calm and now he's not he's really not but if he were to be on the phone and ask for your advice now what city do in light of that devastating undercover video\n... and this goes completely against my grain of of how I think you have to be on offensive us on the offensive I think you have to be aggressive I think you have to take control of issues rather than\nJust whistle pass the graveyard and hope they will go away I I Do however think what Phil will do will not to be a to take action just showing himself as a leader I think he's going to do what he's done most of this campaign and hide in the bunker I think he's going to follow the Megan Barry when her scandal erupted just\nPretend it didn't happen don't look them in the rye and hope that the mainstream media will cover for you and I think what shocked Megan burying against some of these staffers that are there in the British and can't pay at least one of them was a a former Megan Barry volunteer or work or in some capacity with her new American organization that\nWorks with the uh the illegal immigration community um I I think I think Phil and his staff will try to follow the Megan Barry model of just hope it goes away goes way the reason that didn't work for Megan is because inexplicably\nUnbelievably the local media followed up on the story did and they brought out during the day after day they fill Williams they they thought they only briefly but they did do it briefly pretended to be actual journalist say actually followed up on the facts and the truth and told the story and and that drove\nMegan Barry from office despite the fact that she kept you know holding out this hope that it'll just go away that it'll be a one day story and go away\nI think that's what the British and campaigned us I think they assume and account on that the Tennessee in and I\n... in the story and the tendency in about ...\nYeah that that there he's going to count on the fact that the tendency and we'll cover for him that the that the TV outlets will cover for him that they're not going to go pound this and put this video out locally now they're going to have Sean Hannity put it out on Fox tonight you can see this video at Tennessee star dot com getting don't believe us believe your lying eyes\nGo watch the video and then you tell us if it's if it has the impact that we are talking about that if people see it\nBut if the Tennessee and and the rest of the news media\nDoesn't cover the story and instead choose to cover up for ...\nThen it will have less impact than if they did their jobs and actually reported to\nTell you just tell me what you think bill is going to do what advice would you give him\nI I think because he can count on the Tennessee and and\nAnd the or the other media outlets to cover for him I think I Would take the ignore it see if give it a few days and see if anybody picks it up and does anything with it now I think they're going to see the black when campaign and some of the independent expenditure groups pulled out clips maybe maybe uh\nMaybe set up a website you know the real fill San calm and and drive people to see the video I think you're you're going to have to use social media and other means of pushing the video out if you're on the Marsha Blackburn side or wanting to help Marsha Blackburn you've got to push it out because again the mainstream media the dare I say\nFake news media is going to cover this up and if I'm Phil Bredesen I count on them because it is a consistent pattern the Megan Barry do the job journalism of tell the truth that was an aberration that even a broken clock is right twice a day and\nDon't have to lose a penny there is a better safer way to save for retirement and you can learn about it in

who you are you know who you are you're at the table as well You're welcome to join us a as we can first and talk a little bit about this ah\nThis videotape from project very toss that I I think has potential to really shake up the Senate race in Tennessee seven three seven nine five did you want to join us in the end share your thoughts on what you think the ... campaign should do what you think they will do and what impact you think this this video might have\nOn on the Senate race seven three seven nine five to do and you may be thinking to yourself what what video you're talking about because\n... and one of the Tennessee and this morning I didn't I didn't see it on the local news coverage didn't say if you're going to Tennessee star dot com we've got it as our top story of the day Tennessee star dot com it is a a a videotape four and a half minutes where an undercover a volunteer who ... who was at the ... campaign headquarters\nTaped videotaped and you can see the video four and a half minutes long Tennessee star dot com or caught the\nCampaign operatives that are running the volunteer campaigns the phone banking the voters security talking openly about the fact that Bill Bryson in his\nAnnouncement that he would have voted for Brett Kavanaugh was lying that he wasn't telling the truth that is all about politics and trying to fool voters which as the ... campaign team makes it clear they think are very stupid and dumb enough to fall for this stuff and and maybe we are\nBut there are that they're not going to say this outside the building but as they were talking inside their\nCone of silence a they had their ability to to express what they really thought about Donald Trump about Tennessee voters about what feels really doing and what the what the messaging is versus the truth they were very open\nAnd if you see this video you'll see the real truth about what Phil Bredesen in his campaign is all about it's what we've been telling you for much it's just rare that you have the opportunity to see it with your own little beady eyes it's called corroborating evidence\nSuddenly that a doctor for did not\nDid not have so so what is in this video again you've got to see it to really understand it fill up a Phil Bredesen running a pretense campaign\nHe is never fill he is deliveries he's doing exactly the Democratic playbook of of play like you or something you're not to fool the voters and then you get in and then you've got to put Chuck Schumer and the the left wing Democrat crazies in Paris the Doug Jones play book that he played perfectly ... in Alabama because of the complicity of the media\nThe media didn't expose who Doug Jones really was and the media in Tennessee is not doing it now look to Tennessee and and the and the left wing fake news media newspapers aren't going to cover this I I Will be shocked\nIf you see this covered in the Tennessee and I'll be shocked if you see it covered by any of the the television media other than perhaps channel to W. care in in in natural I think they might they might do this\nI I Will be shocked if you get much coverage from the quote so called conservative media in Tennessee there aren't I mean other than the tendencies start other\nThan under the only online news a conservative\nAnd even in radio I mean are are there are people that will avoid touching this because while the seats are broken and we can't we can't talk about\nThat or we do real investigative journalism I mean we broke at ten minutes after the project for tests video was released\nSo there might be some of your book conservative media that won't touch this either because well\nThen they'd have to give credit to somebody else for actually doing the job of conservative being an investigative reporter yeah that that that might be a little bit hard for them to to swallow into anyway if you're going to Tennessee star dot com check out the video go to Tennessee star\nOn Facebook where you can easily share it with all your friends we are going to be able to count on the mainstream media getting this truth out there they're going to suppress it they're going to cover it up\nThey're not going to cover the news they're going to cover up the news for Phil Bredesen is up to us\nTo to distribute this video and make sure that that as many voters and Tennessee have the opportunity to not do not just hear about it but see\nWe published this last night about eight twenty pm central time it already has three thousand eight hundred Facebook shares\nBut you've got several million people will vote in this election and if they do not see\nThis video and understand that Phil Bredesen\nIs lying to them that particular these Republicans that are kind of going along the the way with oh well Phil Bredesen he's a moderate he's a centrist is not going to be one of those evil Democrats that's not what his team says it's not what the team he's assembled believes and they've come together because they hate Trump\nBecause they want him to be a hundred percent Democrat while he was denying that he he's going to be that one person attacked marshal last I'd say how do you read my mind to know what I'm going

L. A. C. uh ... will report it however you know this is not like the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties where you know there's only a couple of networks is only a couple of newspapers and something called social media\nOut there and so you can shared on Facebook you can tweet us ...\nA ... and put it on social media and I think that that's one way to get it out to go around uh the local mainstream media\nYou you can bet that if this was Marsha Blackburn in her her campaign team\nTalking disparaging about Trump\nTalking I'm Talking about oh we're going to tell the voters were for this or we're for that and and we're not really\nThat this would be a banner headline it'd be like Nixon resigned kind of a forty eight point type in the Tennessee and it's that they're going to they're going to cover this up and that's what the president's going to count on that one of the other things that are that the British some campaign team says in this tape and this is will steward one of the campaign workers\nAre making it clear that\nThe British ... can't tell the people he is aligned with Chuck Schumer because that might be damaging [noise]\n[laughter]\nLike why we didn't hear for those calls this a that's a that's why we're not running\n[laughter] yeah exactly [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The TN Star Gill Report", "city": "Nashville", "day": "11"}
