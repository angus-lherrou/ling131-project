L. A. C. if you're outside or the local area\nUm we're gonna talk just a moment about the a an exclusive interview in the tendency star with the Senator Lamar Alexander Just a moment but I Want to ask a micro badly he the video editor in chief of the tendency stars are\nHere this morning about some comments that Senator Whitehouse a Democrat that your digital committee and some other Democrats a leader\nOr added to relate to the list here saying that a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed it back to this week delay by the FBI and the investigation and eventually if he does have enough votes in the U.S Senate in ... quite frankly could be in doubt but if he does have enough votes to get confirmed\nA Senator Whitehouse is saying he will be further investigated while he sits on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I've been trying to remember there's ever been to a time where we have had someone sitting on the court that under investigation especially if the Democrats win the Senate\nAnd uh but we had anything of that nature that you could remember that uh we would continue sort of a hearing even after the person is confirmed trying to find something on an individual I I just can't ah I I just can't remember a case that was similar to this\nOh I don't think there's ever been an ongoing never ending witch hunt of this sort of not not that I can recall there there has been an investigation into a sitting Supreme Court justice back in the Nineteen sixties Abe Fortas you remember Abe Fortas appoint a Democrat\nBut you'll have to lead to refresh my memory\nThe Democrat appointed by Lyndon Johnson to the Supreme Court and apparently there were some uh\nAllegations that while he was an attorney he took money for a for a deal that was not quite up and up\nUh anyway so he ended up resigning from the Supreme Court ah ... we've also had in American history\nThere have been about Seventeen instances of federal judges that have been impeached\nBy the house of representatives and I think only about eleven of them have been convicted I mean I'm Talking about Supreme Court justices a district court justices et cetera but but those are you know for a high crimes and misdemeanors right this this is you know look this is the new world we live in\nWhere the Democrats are far left ideologues who cared nothing\nAbout the rule of law nothing about truth they care about power and they are going to relentlessly attempt to pursue that power at all costs going forward you know this is the New America we live in\n[noise] yeah I think you and I both thinking this investigation is is probably nothing more than cover for some a U.S senators especially Republicans here to maybe vote in favor\nOf the nomination when it's all said and done but it also opens up the possibility that it may turn the other way for sure you know some of the people I was talking to this weekend or some of them in DC a couple in the administration seemed to believe that there were other senators that\nIncluding senator Collins and I'm In Murkowski that might have been on the verge of voting no if indeed something like this had not been done and it makes you wonder Mitch has got the votes um to make this happen\nIt's hard to read the tea leaves I think we'll learn for sure on friday there are five right now a cabinet has forty eight votes there are five senators\nOr who haven't declared yet three are Republicans to our Democrats and I'm going to include in the Republican Jeff Flake as the\nI don't know as he declared yet I think what's his current position today after well\nI don't know it depends on if somebody makes him in an elevator and\nWe might really load the elevator strategy letters confront you Jeff Flake\nAnd an elevator yeah on Saturday he in the center Coons this was actually played on the the sixty minutes interview they were at some gathering I don't know and a ... legs to meet me in an elevator I mean uh so uh apparently if you meet him in an elevator able to change his view so we need to gather round the elevator right before a Senate vote up apparently ...\n... they tried to convince the mayor or at least we know where the senator from a one of the senators from Tennessee I think well both of them I think said he will do to ... you have an exclusive interview at the tendency star dot com on this and we've got some audio often let's play the audio with the Lamar Alexander here\nBut as we sit here on a friday when this whole process is still ... a credit for that yeah investigation maybe voted next week earlier lay as you look at it right now where do you see going again while we change [laughter]\nNotice\nJudge Kavanaugh said\nAt sea below Gore's starting do a Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee about the the situation idea [laughter] I think that's a that's a good way for him to put it I guess is that he did meet one uh Michael that he didn't need further investigation to determine how he's going to vote on this\nThat he was strongly in support of judge cabinet makes you wonder I Wonder if he had breakfast with Lindsey Graham because you know he he was strong\nYou know one of the ... the comments on social media over another bit anyone but they said that uh you know what happened to Lindsey Graham last week the apparently a Senator McCain's estate has released Lindsey\nGraham's private part we're glad to see it right [laughter] I mean how many people were shocked I mean I get home you know relatives and everything and and listeners in the\nSouth Carolina that follow me on social media and they were like wow Lindsey Graham can you believe in what happened or what a turnaround but he was the big star last week I guess and and some people said is I think senator ... said it in the sixty minutes

there was a time when the media would say something like a you know about a potential president or they would have these uh these stories and discussion topic is about is this the guy you really want to drink a beer with I think they would even do like a\nYou know a polling numbers about or would you drink a beer with this guy well now with the judge capital and all the discussion about he was a beer drinking days are barely now it's almost like they're asking the question did you ever drink a beer with bread\nAnd if I had called the FBI immediately right did I Am I right about that\nBeer is bad now apparently severe that yeah\nI mean actually that's what they would always say as if there was a conversation they ride you want to sit down and have a beer with the guy\nWell are they it was well documented during the hearing last week that Brett Kavanaugh like beer and a and we're you know we keep making so much about it now we've got this North Carolina so he professor who said he was with him on the basketball team of jail and\nAnd again but he drank beer and you are directly a job to very quickly I might add that you know he's another one that's been involved in democratic politics I guess my question any conservatives that have a problem with judge Kavanaugh that or were they any conservative the gala Nineteen eighty two that'd be the better question\nWell God there are virtually no conservatives at Yale today we know that is you're right I you know I was actually you know I I I have a confession you read is ... ... you won't get confirmed either [laughter] I Am an Ivy League or\nOh there are a little little we will hold it against you know whether we hold against the but he's a lawyer write a little\nBit before cabinet and I and I will tell you there's a real group think that goes on there there's a league\nIt gives them that goes on there and took me about ten years over the fact that I attended an Ivy League school and I'm starting to small businesses what you know ... ... what got me over it because they become very humble very quickly\nWell you know that's an interesting point because you're right DC is packed with ah people who went to Ivy League or having a ... or the league education right I mean there's there is sort of a a mentality there you know people talk about journalists all the time about is there this groupthink and sometimes it's not really did you get together and\nAnd uh and come up with the the agenda of the day or anything like that but you have a background you have a world view it is sort of a at least a in some ways molded I guess uh when you go to college and so you you have some of the you reach the same conclusions and maybe that's what's going on with the\nUh with what you're talking about there so you know it's a it is a shame that we have so little evidence if any evidence at all\nOr about the background of judge cameras on and it would not be shocking I think you would agree with me on this wouldn't be shocking it'd be doesn't get burned right because more people that say about\nIt but I Will say the ... you know we'll learn you know what happened with these five or senators decide to do a by friday I think you know the vote will be held on friday\nAnd it will be very close or it could be it's entirely possible that all five of these undecideds\nA flake Collins Murkowski on the Republican side hide camp and mansion on the Democratic all five of them could possibly vote in favor of his confirmation which would have been confirmed him by a fifty three forty seven marching\nBut it's also possible that all five of them could vote against it or some combination they're up you know my my in game probability right now\nMy personal endgame probability with no evidence no additional information beyond what everybody's seen in the press is I I'll give him about fifty one percent a chance of being confirmed\n[noise] I guess I'm kind of leaning that he won't be only because I just can't seem center mccaskey and uh I don't know about Collins but uh you know I Know you can lose one but not to not to vote and I just I just have a feeling that the you know it's going to get worse um because you know the Democrats are going to say after this one we ... we haven't had a ...\nWell after ... ... is there will be a vote on front\nAnd you think do you think there will be absolutely\nOff your ... I think so yeah I think there will be a vote on friday\nYeah I Hope I'm Glad to hear your optimism because you know after talking to people over the weekend I just I'm thinking that Mitch McConnell does not have the votes\nOr is there any you know I mean the pressure of the time these uh a lady you know senators is so great and a ... and will we see a change illusion interesting\nOp polled the judge gateway pundits got the ah got the story but there's a poll in Missouri and I think you mentioned about Claire McCaskill where she stands on this whole thing and apparently after this Kavanaugh hearing the Republican challenger may have taken the lead at least in this whole uh\nAll the way she yeah what do you think\nAbout well I run a story about that at Breitbart actually at the end that poor pull by Missouri scout shows you that that they're GOP challenger Josh Hawley has a two point lead but what's interesting they asked this question are you more or less likely to vote for Claire McCaskill who by the way is opposing\nThe Kavanaugh nomination after the confirmation process\nAnd by nine seven point margin likely Missouri voters are less likely to vote for McCaskill after she came out against Kavanaugh that Paul was conducted on Wednesday before the hearings and Thursday during the hearing so\nNot the full effect of that so I think what you're going to see is huge pressure\nUh as polls show more people are inclined to support the nomination than opposing\nYeah I'm just wondering do you think that might be a situation where a Senator McCaskill might change oh no no no you don't need to know to\nThe Democrats and play and the high camp in North Dakota and mansion in West Virginia and we'll hear at seven Fifteen from Chris ... news anchor in Fargo North Dakota about how people in North Dakota feel about high camps about [noise]\nAll right the discussion ... joined the program right at the news at six o'clock he in a Michael will continue the next couple of hours remember you can always dial in during the program seven three seven\nW ELL easy and outside the local area Jane hundred six eight eight W ELL easy to get hit me up on a Twitter or Facebook or any time it will correspond with you that way of course and check out our website Tennessee star dot com let me invite you to sign up for the daily email updates Tennessee star\nDad gummed thanks to Austin doing a great job reducing during this hour that shit for me and we look forward to talking to you again tomorrow morning Michael Patrick\nLeahy here on the Tennessee Starr Report early edition emigrate rest of your day here on TALK radio Ninety three Fifteen tin W.
