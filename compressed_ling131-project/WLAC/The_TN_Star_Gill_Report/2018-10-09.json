August is second wife Marta ... yeah [laughter]\nThat's true it's true or here's one I knew you were in trouble was one of her big hits that would be for judge Kavanaugh I think right\nNow in trouble

Kavanaugh\nAnd uh he said he's you know like say there's with music twenty five percent less now but in a hit job on a Marsha Blackburn and I'm like okay so she's worth according to Forbes she's worth two hundred and eighty million dollars that was last week with interest you know what it is this week right\nAnd uh as you've been involved in politics before Michael as she does she gave me the money to candidates or anything I mean\nOr else ... as I Would say huh\nShe's worth two hundred and eighty million dollars so you would think if you are really involved in politics that you might you know have a long history of contributions well one of the things we do at the tendency star is investigative reporting so we put our Sherlock Holmes hat on\nAnd it looks good on you to buy anyway thank you have to say the federal election commission website but better you've been Steve [laughter] [laughter] and we\nFound that there is one contribution one contribution that a person by the name of Taylor Swift that we can find has ever made in the past ten years to political candidate and a cane in two thousand fourteen or it was a donation to a far left\nDemocratic congresswoman or Bonnie Watson Coleman\n... yeah that was right the mind yep yep she now she was running for the Congress into that fourteen she won and she now represents a congressional district in New Jersey now Taylor Swift who was worth two hundred and eighty million dollars according to this record\nAll of the Republican crossover that he had been counting on in which he had had some you know eight eight to nine percent cross over a ... that seems to have dissipated as a recent poll that shows him now losing by eight points to Marcia indicates\nYeah sometimes you don't have it both ways you get nothing out of it right and and I mean the ... the I think people realize it wasn't a courageous stand of any any type or when you wait till the last minute and you already know how the votes going to be right I mean you know and then it was fairly confident on who was going to win\nA and so um you know ... you're trying to appeal to to both sides and and that makes a really neither side [noise]\nI'm very happy with the president made some comments yesterday an opposite if we've got if you can get that to read the president made a comment about Taylor Swift a in this whole sort of controversy and and whether titles with really knows much about Marsha Blackburn since she seems to be so afraid Marsha Blackburn I Would guess she she was no somebody\nMight alter what what she she was she said her voting

what are these musicians\nAnd then he went off on their own just musicians in general but it was all based on his Taylor Swift thing Michael where he was like you know they're not that smart and why would people will be looking to a musician really in it for their you know political sort of uh\nInformation while they do but I guess like you were talking about yesterday they had this idea that well I I'm In the public spotlight I've got to say something I got to get involved right and uh and it's not just a playlist whip but it's a lot of these Hollywood types\nAnd uh you know I used to enjoy going to the movies and everything and I could put aside when whatever politics people at him and kind of enjoy things but it's getting to the point now where they are telling me how dumb I Am to support one candidate or another or my values are somehow way out of the mainstream\nOf America and all of this and uh I'm getting now okay I'll get my coffee somewhere else well or I'll start making my decisions based on a\nDog you went to ... school you're a graduate of middle Tennessee State University you apparently you don't have ... but\nShot at Taylor Swift who was born in Pennsylvania and moved here briefly to attend high school in ... and then in two thousand fourteen moved to New York city where she bought a twenty million dollar condo in the tribe Becca neighborhood

I mean if it's going to be monitored a music it would be country music for me\nAnd uh you know and so in fact I used to enjoy you know way back to the grand old Opry in ... in such we would uh you know a go at a mini Saturday nights and and uh and and watch some of the the stars Opry land was still around back then and and ... and so that was a sort of what I grew up with but the the idea\nThat those Tennessee music values what battle I guess a country music was actually you know it was it was more the common person it was not elitist it certainly wasn't liberal back then I don't know is there to actually on a little bit\nYeah that was very patriotic well values have changed a lot last thirty I mean I'm not dealing unit and you don't know I mean the difference in just being on the radio and talking about issues which I've been doing for all these many years is a ... we talked about things we will never dreamed about discussing\nUh open a Thirty Years' ago and the er I think the irrigation of the culture I don't think that's I don't think it's been a good thing really you know people say what values are you talking about Tennessee values\nWell they get a chance to be on TALK shows around the country these days and people have differing you know there's some regional differences obviously in this country about certain things\nAnd values in Tennessee uh and sometimes we'll be viewed as outside the mainstream and in uh in other places or I always thought it was just the you know being sort of patriotic\nOr believing in a you know I'm trying to give respect to authority

about forty five percent less\nFast [laughter]\nAnd I was wondering why why not fifty percent last Seventy five percent less where the president you know he's given a riot gear it only twenty five percent less than he did yesterday apparently by the way you had a good memory or Kanye West and uh tell us we have had a few going back to two thousand and nine\nAnd what happened was on I'm On the MTV Video Music awards and and I was like you I remembered something but I couldn't remember exactly what it was about but ah she received the best female video award\nAnd up the song you belong with me and when she was giving her acceptance speech county I jumped up on stage grab the Mike\nInterrupted her and said yo Taylor I'm really happy for you and we'll let you finish by beyond the had the best video of all time best video of all time he said and and apparently even the president weighed in on this at the time President Obama called him quote unquote of jackass up are doing what he did so that that's how that all started a\nKind of bad I'd hairs you had a you know things things change over time hey by the way I don't know if you saw her story on the tendency star today are about the two thousand Eighteenth pork or to have you seen it yes yes I have been so here's the thing at the ... the people in our listening audience can go and\nVote for the very worst towards the beacon center has put up for options and and uh they're all pretty egregious examples of pork ah ... the the the options are a disgraced former mayor Nashville\nA a Nashville or making Barry for all the overtime that ... her lover a sergeant forests are bodyguards or got that's number one but there's a couple of others to look at um one is service master got a five and a half million dollars to move down the street and you know that\nWell I mean a little money here there [laughter]\nSo that's the number two option the number option a company called alliance Bernstein got some unknown amount of money I think it's in the millions undisclosed yeah yeah\nBut they had a further move it was from Wall street to to a Broadway here in in Nashville so that was a third choice you could vote for\nWhat you want to be close to the wild horse I understand\nBut but the ... the last choice which I thought was interesting is apparently the University of Tennessee is paying people not to come to work [laughter]\nAll right where do I sign up for our [laughter]\nPaying people not to come to work yeah wow yeah yeah yeah yeah that sounds like you know I might start\nDone I chip interview because professors anymore always indoctrinated are young people so\nI might you have been on this but that might actually be depending upon the professor that might be public interest to do that but actually exactly\nWill I be able to do it what is it a go fund me out so either that or swift and she had been but this you only get fifty bucks to [laughter]\nLitigated [laughter] I Wish I were three hundred and twenty million [noise] [laughter] [laughter]\nWhat's his those do you think you would vote for ...\nOh I Would go with number one obviously because I mean a mayor you know the mayor's sort of a escapades were fun reading so no I Would have to do that with that you know here's a ... but here's the thing Michael that's the swap\nThat's what people don't like right I mean and it it's not only just I'm I'm sort of making decisions\nYou know that a kind of go against what I think many of us think our best interests but it's it's just kind of a buddy buddy a pork barrel spending all that kind of stuff uh the coziness that occurs where you know if you're the person in power you can do without the some some dollars here and there isn't that kind of the the swamp in your opinion\n[noise] yeah I you know just from a point of view of readership you know the Megan Barry having here or a bodyguard lover paid by taxpayer funds to travel to Athens\nA grease and various Paris along with her that that was just you know it was traffic goals for the tendency star\n[laughter] got to be ... well\nI I Would say actually uh the the one I Would vote for was this move of this company called alliance Bernstein from uh New York city uh it it was a truck Becca [laughter] we're we're Taylor Swift as\nThe I'm really I'm On a real dot com looking for my twenty million dollar apartment here\nNow it was from Wall street to Broadway here in\nNashville but what's interesting about that is it's it's an unknown amount of billions apparently nobody can find out\nHow many millions they were given to come here and my question is do we really need ... you know more folks are paid probably six figures from\nNew York city to come here with New York city that used to live in Nashville and then subsidize them to come here I mean is that something that we really need\nI accept that is well I mean\nWhen you're talking about subsidizing yeah I Want to know more right\nUm ... you know a lot of times of course and I don't know in this case because this was this is one I'm not familiar with but the\nYou know we do some of this and I think the criticism is valid where are you know we're trying to to bring businesses in and and and help create jobs that have Steve talked about you know various ah corporations that\nAt all to get some sweetheart deals he didn't ah like over the years and so I Know some of that goes on I don't know how are you you really should go in the idea of creating jobs\nDon't tell you how far you should go you want to hear\nWhere you had the the media the mob run amok you had the professors at Duke University sign these letters condemning the athletes condemning the entire lacrosse a team though the athletic department of Duke and yet at the end of the day it was all a lie they had these athletes were fortunately for them\nHad absolute documented proof one of them was actually swiping a key card across town when this a rape supposedly occurred it was proven that they did not do it the da da da da da da da da Vinci like and perjuring yourself\nPut her in jail because they decided she was too crazy to a sexually jail she went on to commit murder\nBut she was too crazy to jail but not too crazy to believe by these left wing mobsters that that were out there you know calling for these guys heads when they hadn't done anything that the the investigation at the end when a proper investigation was done declared them innocent the FBI doesn't usually do that\nSo usually they say we've been to the investigation you have to you have to go pretty far to get them to say OK yeah you didn't do it and that that's what they did in this\nOr that holes ceremonial swearing in last night\nWas purposeful on the part of the president and purposeful on the part of Canada that's a message is there a is unusual to have that level of\nOf messaging coming out but the president clearly wanted wanted that message proven innocent to come across and the reason is because\nHe wants to reassert the legitimacy of the Supreme Court end Kavanaugh followed with a very I thought I'm very gracious statement where he was saying look we had a very contentious\nConfirmation process\nBut I Am committed to being a team player he emphasized that ah there weren't teams on a team of nine and and I'm part of that now here's the reality of it though as

L. A. C.\nIf you want to use the toll free lined you can do that too it's eight hundred six eight nine five to two and a ... we were talking just a moment ago about how the the activist liberals on the Supreme Court are the ones who are really politicizing the court you're not seeing you know Justice Roberts chief justice Roberts going out giving a bunch of political speeches Clarence Thomas\n... you're not seeing these guys out there pushing a political agenda and yet when you look at what what Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been out giving speeches if she can stay long wait long enough to to actually give her speech\nIf she can actually rouse herself up to approach to the podium to give a speech Rosie's slumped down barely able to communicate and this is the woman who's who claims she's got the the the quick this end the wit to to be able to make these big decisions cast these\nVotes this is the problem with the life time appointments to the Supreme Court her physical capabilities of diminished to the point that she is hanging on simply hoping she can she can hang on another five years to deny President Trump the opportunity to make you have another appointment to the Supreme Court and we'll see if if that happens or not and yet you've got to Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor\nWho are too extreme left us to report on the court thinks the Republicans going along and voting for them not doing to them what happened to Brett Kavanaugh and\nAnd the Elena Kagan was giving a speech I think it was at Princeton prince on friday\nFriday night after the Susan Collins speech\nMaking her political agenda known\nI think it's friendly I'm quote unquote by the court that in the last Thirty years starting with Justice O'Connor\nAnd continuing like Justice Kennedy Hispanic person now\nFound the center where people couldn't put that in that sort of way\nThat's the name of the court and what's not on by one side or another and a and watching it I Am partial neutral unfair and it's not clear that you know I think going forward [noise]\nAnd then you were looking at you know Joe Manchin being fifty three we might have seen a hide camp we might have seen some others this became so divided so so much emotion tied into it that that these Democrats could not say no to their own radical extremist loony tune base\nSo let me ask you this question let's say you're Brett Kavanaugh this morning and you're about to go in to the Supreme Court to the far end with the other eight justices I'm ... ... what do you think you're walking into what what what's the dynamics of the court as you're walking into it how\nHow do you think the Ginsburg's Kagan's the soda my yours are going to interact with you and what kind of strategy would you deploy to be a a team player\nI think we've seen in in this man throughout his career and and through the confirmation process until they started the smear a guy that that does work\nIntellectually and personally to find a common ground\nI think again that just as his tone his tenor throughout the whole confirmation process again until he was the the victim\nOf a smear campaign that was orchestrated politically I don't think anybody can relieve in doubt that any more if you're going to be honest you look at the funding you look at the at the orchestrate you look at the talking points rubbing being coming from all different directions when you see the exact same language coming from multiple directions\nThat that's a pretty good sign that there was sort of this unseen hand that is directing it it was a parent\nAnd and yet until that happened he showed who he was and I think he showed fight\nAt that process he's still didn't get vindictive you didn't get personal he didn't attack Dr Ford he didn't attack the senators and say well sport you know\nSpartacus you lied about being in Vietnam if you want to talk about the the one my major lying about everything you know let's go a little Latin Latin here you lied and you're you're sitting here judging as a hypocrite he could have gone a lot further than he did so\nI think in the in the face of the attacks were you know targeted him he showed his character he showed her throughout his career\nI think the problem is the character in class he showed last night\nAnd that he's shown throughout his career is not the character in class he's going to get from Ruth Bader Ginsburg Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor they are they're as political operatives they're going to act as political operatives what they should worry about the the three ladies on the bench we're putting their politically the allergy I head of America I head of the court\nSteven prior got little bit more class and character then that Steven prior maybe one that they may lose on some key votes and it'd be a six three instead of a five four because I don't think he will tolerate the kind of politicization and demonization of the court the let's tear this baby down burned baby burn I don't think Steven briar\nGo along with that I see it exactly the same way I think the cabinet is going to go in there is going to be the team player he can be very nice to these to the other of the liberals on the court and um that Ginsburg Kagan and sort of money or are gonna are going to give them the back of their hands\nThey're going to be I don't think there can be very nice them at all I think they can look for every opportunity to undermine the legitimacy of the court\nAnd he's won by by seven one thousand [noise]\nWas too cold for camp [noise] oh\nJohn Deere gator extra thirty

complexity in the words Mitt thing but anyway that's that's just my view is if you really want to move the Thirteen year old girl vote than than she's probably your choice now Taylor Swift has has this political arena\nWith a with a long history of political activism of of really being engaged and involved I mean she's been making like massive political donations I don't know why were surprised at the\nAt the sudden surge into the into the political arena with her denunciation of Marsha Blackburn\nAnd an endorsement of Phil Bredesen endorsement of congressman Jim Cooper this is the most exciting thing by the way this ever happened to a gym Cooper's life [laughter] in fact that somebody somewhere of any level of celebrity is paying attention to congressman Jim Cooper I've always said about Jim Cooper the guy not only has no charisma\nIf he stands next to you he has a black hole charisma hours away in military now it doesn't make his bigger just suckered into a black hole in it all just kind of disappears into nothing there's an and yet she has really been a political activist for quite some time writing big\nChecks to ... you know the big big checks now her network has apparently three hundred and twenty million dollars and by the way much of which was a mass\nBy not having to pay state income taxes in California and New York where she has presided she's kept her Tennessee residency so she wouldn't have to pay those exorbitant New York state income taxes and city income\nTaxes you know Marsha Blackburn is really one of the key people and making sure that that state income tax or never came to Tennessee back in two thousand well with the horn on cars there you were with Marcia and the killer bees\nWhile Tehran her family were living in Pennsylvania and those are her Tennessee values were formed in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania\nAnd and then reaffirmed in in ... back to New York where she bought her twenty million dollar condos look I don't begrudge or

about a painter\nWith endorsing a Phil Bredesen Phil Bredesen tweet that again proves why some Seventy four year olds I wouldn't say all Seventy four you know there's some hip Seventy for\nThis one that I can think of almost Seventy four who's pretty good on Twitter\nThat President Trump to Seventy two people actually read his and and uh some of the folks that are criticizing the uh the Phil Bredesen ... by the way the imagery\nThat that that we've got up to the sea star dot com of\nOf the ultra hip uncle Phil Bredesen ... is is worth checking out another story we're checking out the Shelby County has delayed a road project are critical road project due to the fact that Shelby County is imposed these guidelines of minority participation the companies that do business with\nShelby County Memphis a minority participation has to be at least twenty eight percent\nOr if they if they're going to a road paving project you've got to\nFind contractors who offer at least twenty eight percent minority participation and and now some of the officials in Memphis are saying well it's it's a goal it's not a requirement yet will will come up short on that and see what happens when you started getting sued and your legal fees exceeds the value in the in the profits are going to make from the contract so\nNot surprisingly Shelby County can't find anybody to pave this road because they can't find a contractor\nIn this north Shelby area who can meet the twenty eight percent minority participation guidelines well that makes perfect sense or not I mean I Love having these\nWhat you are matters more than what you do guidelines that cities put into place the minority participation deal you know if I go into the emergency room and I'm suffering a heart attack I mean I literally touched my chest I've I've fallen out of a chair at a restaurant they rushed me to the hospital and if we're going into the emergency room for\nYou know hopefully emergency life saving surgery\nDo do

sitting right there you can join us on the phone lines on this hour as well as seven three seven nine five\nTo to do do you think of his cabinet shop like preparing my lunch in like the new the new ones bugs me what your first day of school was always a big deal that box we were kids and you know and you might you might be the Roy Rogers lunch box what what lunch box do you think Brett Kavanaugh got for his first day on the\nCourt I don't know but his two daughters that they're watching it and say we're joined now by our our good friend and managing editor of our sister publication the Minnesota son Anthony go ... who ah who has covered this crazy story about what will happen Anthony don't tell us good morning Anthony\nWarning guys hey Antony so how's it going well ...\nYou wrote a story that also that appeared in the Minnesota sun and the tendency star about this teacher that said in this tweet on right after the cabinet was confirmed and the teacher said quote\nSo who's going to take one for the team and kill cabinet what can you tell us about this story Anthony\nThat's right so right as you mentioned that she tweeted a ad in the school district she works for a later released a statement a and affirming that had had received several complain about the teacher who was named Samantha mess uh\nAnd they place or on paid administrative\nLeave hay to Leo exactly so\nShe can get some time off of work while the taxpayers are footing the bill it's pretty uh pretty ridiculous uh\nAnd the FBI bureau in Minneapolis and the Dakota county sheriff's office are both stated that they were aware of her comment um they didn't elaborate I mean for the uh for fear of any sort of investigation happens the fats currently works that\nSo Antony up in Minnesota what do you have to do to be put on on sleep as a teacher\nA that's a good question at this point I think it would take a lot um and you know the sad thing is this sort of\nBehavior is active on the rise and it's sort of rhetoric has a over the past few weeks or has been occurring a lot and Minnesota I'm just last week congressman Eric pulse and his wife received a phone\nCall at their own home I'm Jeff Johnson his running mate her home was uh actually entered by a democratic tracker\nWho Lied to her how's it going to gain archery\nSo Jonathan's running for governor and the running mate running for lieutenant governor so don't you just explain so ... so the lieutenant governor candidate who do do some a democratic tech tracker entered the home of the Republican candidate is that what that\nIs that correct yes she is tracker likes you are Donald Bergstrom has been a younger kid a he said that he was lost that needed to use the phone and so her husband's politely letter man\nAnd one daughter Bergstrom the candidate got home or whether this democratic tracker that in there waiting for 'em\nAnd you know not much was said about it so that's sort of behavior really is just kind of brushed off these days and\nWondering what's wrong with Minnesota I Know you're born there you live there and what's wrong with Minnesota Anthony\nYou know where do I begin a lot of thing um\nI think complacency on his work starts uh people people don't really care um\nAnd in this case with a cement unless the teacher in Minnesota I'm not only issued license to educate the nation years but she's also a special education teacher so she's working with students who are are peculiar Lee vulnerable uh an impressionable\nUm these sorts of comments are really all too common among our nation of educators especially\nEspecially up there in Minnesota so we have a picture of her from her Twitter account and by the way she's been on the job Steve since April and she she looks she kind of looks the part she of somebody who might say let's kill cabinet she has pink hair he has a nose ring and she looked pretty smart that picture\nThat is right um\nHas there been any ... Anthony ... to maybe ... what do they have to do to take away her teaching license again if you if you engage in threats of violence and he sort of things I mean while we're waiting to see if the paid administrative leave might lead to her being terminated from her job is there also an ability to remove her license to teach other kids and maybe pass\nThe trash and just moving to another school\nYeah you know I'm not I'm not too sure I don't have any sort of expertise on what\nOr should not be investigated or I'm really at this point I don't know what would cross a allied with\nThe kinds of [laughter] everything has allowed um well what I Do know a and\nWhat I have observed highland again a recording or for the Minnesota son um is that if the shoe was on the other foot and this was a Republican teacher an FBI investors\nDirect they save tons of money and you can to so skip the retail stores and come to a by force direct warehouse or go to buy floors direct dot com and never pay retail for flooring again\nWhere some people see desperation we see\nSome people see painting\nFor some people see the end of the road\nWe see a day every dog finds a loving home [noise]\nRush Limbaugh weekdays at eleven on TALK radio Ninety eight point three on Fifteen ten ...
