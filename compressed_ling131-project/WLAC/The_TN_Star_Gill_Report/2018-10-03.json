I mean that's the iceberg\nAnd that and then the far left attorney this arose funded attorney recommended by die on Dan Dianne Feinstein staff to her\nBefore anyone in the anyone else on the Republican side of the Judiciary Committee had actually seen the first letter including the accusations now what's interesting I think we talked about this before about this legend incident\nIn this in the summer of Nineteen eighty two when Dr Christine Blasey Ford was Fifteen and a half years old\nAnd a Brett Kavanaugh was Seventeen years or so turns out\nThat her brother the attorney Tom boy as he was Seventeen years old at that time it was living in the same house as was her older brother Ralph blessing junior who was twenty two just graduated from do and was on his way to go back to beat her\nYou see of North Carolina where he kind of J. D. MBA so [laughter]\nSo her brothers both of her brothers that are that we're in the house that summer are now accomplished attorneys and yet a neither brother has corroborated anything she said neither brother has said anything her parents haven't said\nAnything and apparently when she has a legal issue\nA rather than call her brothers who are a top flight attorneys hurt her brother Tom I was Seventeen years old and may well have been a person who drove around that summer because she didn't have\nA driver's license and he would have had at that age he is actually the associate general counsel for Northrop Grumman in Washington DC the big aerospace company in charge of the intellectual property issues a he's a pretty smart guy in a pretty good attorney\nYou know maybe they charge too much [laughter]\nShe's like I got to get one of these uh you know one call but it's all attorneys and maybe that's it I don't know [laughter]\nI uh [laughter]\nThey are but you're right I mean it it just it makes no sense because let's face it if you have a lawyer in the family the first thing and it's going to happen is most of your family members expect a pre law advise right and if your brother's a than a ... you would just expect a then that the they'd be upset if you didn't call them\nYou know er about some issues especially something as important as this and and it's interesting too and and we said this\nUh you know earlier this week about uh you got a couple of brothers here and you mentioned older brother's\nBeen um the it does it happen or where she is groped by a Brett Kavanaugh and and if and when any further whatever she felt concern for life as you said and all of this you think you would then tell us your brother\nEspecially if he's driving or home perhaps and I'm In you know are the ones I the people I hung out where they would have probably gone and the hits are more with him right maybe a little bit more than if\nYou are I think so and then you're messing around with my sister and we don't like it and um you know we're going to make sure you don't do that again kind of thing I mean that would just be the way young people would have handled the situation either right\nEspecially censor Seventeen year old brother Tom blonde say you know the one who's now a big time attorney that one [laughter] expensive attorney was what was living in the same house as she was and was attend yet why are you upset you Christine wind up saying I mean what happens only go on here but yeah\nTell me tell me and as it turns out a um\nShe her Seventeen year old brother was attending a at an all boys a private school called the last in school or not a very much uh in in the arena of the Georgetown Prep private school that Brett Kavanaugh attend to these were in the same social circles\nSo just think about it you're Fifteen year old sister you're Seventeen years old and you go to a private school and a boy at a rival private school is it is as your sister says oh he's you know tried to sexually or attack me what what does that Seventeen year old boy do\nHe goes over there and started poaching on a red\nDidn't ... but but hey wait wait just a

better route another traffic updated in less than ten minutes on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W well lazy and now back to the Tennessee Starr Report early edition with Doug ...\nWell I Would I Would veto the bill and I think at times you had a first understand I think it's important and the question the nature of the governor's veto power in Tennessee\nThe veto the governor is over written in Tennessee by a simple majority of the legislature is able to pass a law and they pass it with a good margarine that's going to be um the over over it and then so I think that what into governor Haslam thinking but at some times it's important to use the bully pulpit it's it's important to send the message that you need to send\nWhich is say this is just wrong this is this has the legal questions and then veto it\nWith everything going on with regard to the get to earlier that there was a good ... and just last night Michel at a part of the debate the what'd you make of what you heard last night\nWell I think Karl Marx dean just proved ... named oh you bet that that question that question was posed to him about the sanctuary city bill\nAnd which are the tendency general assembly passed a law that said there can be no sanctuary cities in Tennessee\nAnd governor has been a Haslam allow that to become law\nBut bunch Carl Marx dean has he would veto a bill that would outlaw sanctuary cities by the way sanctuary cities really are unconstitutional but not according to Carl Marx Dean I think the bottom line on this debate\nOr which was not really filled with any fireworks but I didn't believe the GOP candidate was very strong in that debate and the reason is he simply articulated this more standard conservative limited government view and Carl Marx dean\nBasically said he used for sanctuary cities in Tennessee good great\nI mean it really is W and get more information on the debate last night at our website Tennessee star Dutch gum you know I've always wondered and maybe you've got the answer to this uh of of why it is that people who believe that a large should be interpreted in\nIt's intended that is a Congress or the state legislature makes all our federal government or the Congress to make the law that we should look at the way or what it was intended to achieve that is what they were trying to accomplish by passing along the first place and why that is controversial why wouldn't you always want judges\nOn any court or to make that kind of determination based on all that is that way we all know what the lawyers and we know whether we violated the law or we you know trends grass in some manner and we kind of good good predict\nWhat the outcome of a judicial decision would be why would we want that rather than the sort of anything goes you know living breathing short of a document guided argument that we're all the time\nWell apparently you know a Democrat gubernatorial Carl Marx dean\nIs in favor of that sort of not not even living constitution approach is basically a we're not going to a sign into law um ... a well documented law\nPassed by the tendency general assembly prohibit sanctuary cities I you know who won the sanctuary cities in Tennessee\nDemocrats of course I mean it who else right I mean it's a\n... the other thing to Michael it seems to me is that you you have this kind of a decision making where you ignore laws that are already on the books right I mean we've seen this around the country with this whole argument about sanctuary cities that yeah the law says that if you're here illegally something should happen you should be sent back\nA and then forced to go through the the the regular process to become a citizen or ... you'll get a you know be so whatever it'd be overstayed their visa\nYou should you should go back or or you know re apply and that kind of thing and and what we've done is we just ignore laws to me that's more dangerous than anything else if you don't like the law get it changed it burn up people did agree with you you will be able to change it\nYou make a very good point and let's let's kind of\nGo forward if there were a governor ... here in Tennessee how do you think he would enforce that law prohibiting sanctuary cities\nIf oh I don't know the left wing mayor of Nashville David Riley decided uh no we're going to have a sanctuary city and we ... we won't allow the federal uh ice agents or homeland security agents to come in here in the state and we won't cooperate with him what do you think Karl Marx dean as governor would do in that case duck\nNone of what we're talking about right ignore the law just simply just not to not enforce it\nGotcha exactly a ... that's when he answers a question\nAbout the sanctuary city law that said there will be no sanctuary cities in Tennessee winning answers a question like that\nIn a public debate I I don't see how the voters have tendency can come to any other conclusion that it would be his intent to ignore the law and it and is intent to ignore the express\nA will of the tendency general assembly when it comes to the enforcement of federal sanctuary and our our federal laws about immigration\nYeah and here's what's wrong with that it seems to me is that the founding fathers put into blazed individually Porsche stages well this idea that the legislature up stage and in in the case in the federal government the Congress\n... they are closer to the people that they represent us and so if we let's say don't want to sanctuary cities\nWe go to our lawmakers in laws passed or in the case of the federal government then you know to federal situation whatever it may be and now we're represented if we simply have they have a situation where people can get elected and they can ignore\nThe law and ignore the representation then therefore we have no voice any longer right we have no way to really deal with things if you simply can't ignore the laws that you don't want to do in ... it's a it's a very dangerous sort of situation I think it was a it was used a lot during the Obama administration and I think it's carrying on\nYou know Doug I'm if I were on that debate panel and by the way [laughter]\nThese debate panels are all you know the far left mainstream media journalists out their quote journalists and they throw the softball to the left wing candidates and try to try to you know put the Republican candidates in a corner you know my follow up question would have been this is why they will never let me on one of these panels by the way\nA might follow up question Doug would have been what other state laws would you not enforced as governor [laughter] right\nRight I mean let's just do the book out the window here because uh we don't need any laws because you'll get to decide you know when every situation that comes along it's it's true I actually had for years I really believe this I'm actually a you know been on some you know ask the questions occasionally on some of these things and uh but I've said what we should get rid of that\nAnd let the uh the question of the other candidates I think we would actually had better debate and get to the point a lot quicker than I'm doing exactly what you're saying where one side seems that gets off balls and the other side actually gets real questions\nWell that's it for me or on the

if it involved sexual activity I Wonder if it involved drug use I I Wonder if it involved theft I mean what was her friend\nConcerned about that you need a doctor Blasey Ford's help to quote pass a polygraph\nAccording to this ex boyfriend who submitted a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee under penalty of perjury the ex boyfriend now lives in California His name was included on the letter but has been rejected\nHe said that he was in a relationship with Dr Ford from Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen Ninety eight\nIt and that Dr Ford he witnessed he physically witnessed Dr Ford coaching her lifelong friend Monica el McLean I may see exactly what he said quote\nThe frenzy media you would expect would have already track down this McLean [laughter] and and\nAsked her about it maybe she's hiding in an undisclosed location where's that bunker the Dick Cheney used after nine eleven she probably hiding at George Soros his basement with the with an for room service available but the bottom line is why is that the media track this woman down and said did you have Dr Ford help you pass a polygraph\nThat's a pretty easy question to ask and you base it on this testimony this a letter from her ex boyfriend Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ex boyfriend who said the following in this letter quote\nI witnessed Dr Ford help Monica el McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam\nDr Ford explained in detail what to expect\nHow polygraphs worked and helped McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam Dr Ford was able to help her because of her own background in psychology and quote\nSee I also want reporters to to ask Dr Blasey Ford what percentage of confidence does she have in her answer that she never never I never did I ever that murder then coached anyone in how to take a polygraph I Would I Would love if a if you're Ken folk\nA Senator Leahy would ask her what percentage confidence do you have that you never\nCoached anybody would it be the same hundred percent

percent was at ten percent\nI I think that we never know [laughter] we'll never know because I I don't think she subjecting herself to serious questioning I don't think she'll come forth now and be

S. it had no tax across the border which was the intent of NAFTA to\nTo make sure that the flow of goods and services between these countries would be at or near zero tear up or zero trade barrier that's not what happened because\nFrankly as Donald Trump is pointed out Mexico and Canada started cheating right from the beginning\nAnd we didn't negotiate a strong deal we didn't follow up but you're going to go from about sixty two percent of a vehicle having to be made in North America\nTo Seventy five percent in order to qualify for the zero tariffs you have a lot of Chinese bulk parts the most expensive parts that would be put in and just inserted but they weren't being manufactured in the u._s. it's intended to deal with that so there's there's a lot of good year\nAlthough it's still a bit too early to determine how how well it will do the American economy\nUnlike a lot of people who are commenting on this new U.S Mexico Canada to deal\nYou actually do something about this Steve you were there the White House the Bush George H W. Bush transition to Bill Clinton when NAFTA was really being developed and uh I think you know you you pointed out quite clearly that you know everybody in serious for free trade\nThat was the idea behind NAFTA as proposed but didn't didn't really turn out that way didn't\nKnow and in large part it's because I mean again as you mentioned I was working for the U.S trade representatives office as director of inter governmental affairs the last six months President Bush the first six months of President Clinton the the NAFTA deal was signed and negotiated under President Bush and then was passed by Congress under\nUnder Bill Clinton you may remember if it was going down it it was not going to pass into the Hail Mary pass was literally when Al Gore debated Ross Perot H. Ross Perot they had to re shuffle the deck and and that debate helped get just enough of the votes from the Democratic side to get to get the deal passed\nAnd then they didn't do anything about it they didn't continue to follow up to make sure that our service companies you know the insurance industry the banking industry legal services the idea was that we would get more access of those higher dollar\nService industry jobs into these other markets and they basically shut that down while they\nKept shipping low cost\nLow wage goods to uh to the U. S. you had different rules there environmental rules gave them a huge advantage they could just dumped toxic materials do they have environmental rules well they were supposed to under the way that it was on tended and and that didn't get enforced again so that\nWhereas a U.S company is going to spend a lot of money dealing with with waste materials in the manufacturing process in Mexico they were just you know dumping it in the in the back in the in the rivers and streams\nThis deal will improve it and and I think that's why you're going to see some bipartisan\nYou know what I thought it was very interesting about that debate the opponent of NAFTA H.

parade it's been called for for tomorrow for up for Brett Kavanaugh and uh\nYou know again I I think folks on a on a step up and make it public Dana I'm posted it on our lift the vote\nPage ah last week a call for prayer for Brett Kavanaugh on his family of a picture of them and to lift the vote on Facebook and by the way to go to lift the vote on Facebook you can find our efforts to make sure that Christian evangelicals are encouraged and\nEnthused and motivated to pray discern and vote in this election cycle in and looking ahead to twenty twenty will be doing that again as well but um she posted a pray for the pets Kavanaugh\nFamily posed over two million views again people when they're called the action when they're called the ... when they're called to to do up to do what what are the Bible has told us to do a second chronicle seven fourteen if my people who were called by my name which means Christians\nWill humbled themselves in prayer turn repair from their evil ways turn their face to God I Will hear your prayers I hear your land\nI mean the Bible tells us specifically to the way to heal our land is to turn to God if you're a Christian and ask his healing hand to be placed on this country and and we get away from that and when we get away from that we get what we've got which is this\nThis culture that's in disrepair this culture that is in decline because we have turned away from God he hasn't drained away from us and and part of what lift the vote focuses upon and and we've seen a indications that uh the Christian evangelicals in particular their votes in this last election we're the difference\nIn in in these places like Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania\nThat they were the swing states that made the difference and they're going to be the swing states in this election is while they're going to be the swing states in twenty twenty as well and and you don't just need to be praying at election time\nWe need to pray for our country we need to pray for our leaders and we need to pray for families like Brett Kavanaugh's families who are family who is being I'm absolutely smeared in this despicable attack and again the attacks that have been launched it Brett Kavanaugh's ten year old daughter\nFor for saying we should pray for the woman to I mean everything I Need to know about Brett Kavanaugh as a father and as a man is that what he and his wife have taught that ten year old girl that she would say and we need to pray for her to\nTells us his heart more than all the testimony more than all the investigations that testified to who he is which is why he should be on the U.S Supreme Court in my view\nI think the American people agree with that few broadly a raft must report poll came out yesterday sixty percent of likely voters believe that if the FBI report shows up and nothing was we'll find out that I can imagine what it would show up in a negative way for a cabinet since\n... we want they've got Dianne Feinstein a Democrat that don't want the FBI report to be be made public they don't want to be released they don't want the fact that they've dispatch these investigators to find the truth did then reveal the truth of what they found\n... exactly but sixty percent say that uh he should be confirmed I think the American people are are realizing now that this was a smear job it was a is a set up to go after him to make it appear um with looks like now apparently perjure testimony\nAlthough I Will say the fact that uh apparently he was questioned by police not arrested and charged not not having any action taken against him that that reportedly in Nineteen eighty five while he and a bunch of his buddies were at a at a bar in in jail\nThey um they got into it a dispute with some other folks including one guy and and Brett Kavanaugh I Know this is hard to believe through ice at the guy\nThrough ice at the guy that is really really really got to be you know just qualifying for what\nI I think the fact that he didn't throw a punch instead I Do I make them ... disqualifying but but you know I'm willing to cutting some slack on that\nAllegedly thirty three years ago he threw I sent a guy in a bar well there you go that you know that that's the new standard that is the is that the Spartacus standard now\nWell let's see the bronco bummer standard remember that rock Obama wrote in a book didn't just you know get caught in an ambush interview didn't didn't get a caller whispering something off Mike when the Mike was really on Brock Obama wrote in his book one of his many books of his\nDetailing his life because you know he wanted to make sure we knew you know what he wanted to let us know about his life or we don't always college transcripts we don't know his his actual academic and and collegiate history but we do know that he claims in his book that was written and edited and then published that he pretty much a really love to be your\nLoved smoking dope love doing he approached drugs enthusiastically in his in his words and yet the left does that look out of it has been taken brace of drugs and alcohol\nWell but speaking of books where people ... express their own conduct admit their own conduct earlier in life Spartacus Booker and wrote a book didn't he he ...\nHe wrote a column when he was a column and our college bragging about his groping of a Fifteen year old girl when he was Seventeen ironically the same ages that are at stake here that Cory Booker is also said that he doesn't care\nIf a if Brett Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent that that doesn't matter to him he doesn't think he's qualified to be on the court because he disagrees with India logically so all of this has nothing to do with what Brett Kavanaugh did or as is becoming increasingly clear didn't do\nA this is all about blocking conservatives from the court which is which is the way the Democrats playing and Republicans other than ... Lindsey Graham need to start puffing up\nAnd and stepping up and and this needs to be the defining issue in this in this mid term elections by the way I like all we we we did something new with the house last night", "show_name": "The TN Star Gill Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "03"}
