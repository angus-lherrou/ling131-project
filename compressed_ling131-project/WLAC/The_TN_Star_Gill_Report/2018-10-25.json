heard I heard\nRussia that yesterday do and he got some attention you know I'm I'm sort of these shows last night about it I guess I don't know uh I'm not kind of willing to go there yet I mean so it has to be either a Democrat sort of operative or it's got to be a Trump supporter light that's doing this\nOr going to be just a crazy person\nRight exactly that was my point is that so we got looney tunes out there that are watching news ah on occasion remember the uh when the Republicans were shot at at a softball game and the and congressmen ... was was you know wounded a that was a a guy turned out to be some Democrats there was a Bernie Sanders supporter right\nExactly I think we know he said they're blamed Democrats exactly right after that and that's what I'm Talking about it so I

headlines and commentary this morning\nOkay so ah once again the media and I guess it was predictable they would blame a President Trump after its surface that uh some of these male bombs were sent to the residents of a ... a former President Obama\nOr Hillary Clinton others CNN or was included here and a Michael you know it it goes back to when we've had a very uh shootings it's the gun that causes it right if it's uh\nIt'd be some other sort of it it must be right wing radio that has been sighted people that's caused it rather than putting the blame the people who actually\nDo the criminal behavior and that's a that was what was happening here it's got to be a President Trump this guy would who are a person to person a person would never have done this whatsoever if Donald Trump was not out there as president apparently right\n[noise] well yes and of course the blame on President Trump or this coming not only from the host of the view but also from the president of CNN Jeff Zucker\nWho immediately went way over the top\n... like within an hour or so of the rival these these ah bomb packages at CNN and with President Obama for President Obama and the Clintons she immediately went on the attack he without any evidence he blames President Trump for this now\nThat is orderly reckless and I think the reaction of the crowd at the President Trump's rally last night you know their favorite the favorite chanted at a rally\nA is CNN sucks right [laughter]\nWell guess what odd so so the the bomb scare happens ah Jeff Zucker goes ballistic\nIn the Eighteen Ninety said I don't know where they came up with this name they were the Brooklyn bride and groom ... okay [laughter] I've I've never heard of the bride and groom census\nRather than the bridesmaid's I guess\nThat would be that might be the current may [laughter] you\nKnow thinking about how many years and I don't have we got on this but do you think about the uh\nYou know the the uh the number of years they've been playing baseball and you know you have these names like the Indians the Braves or whatever and uh the Indians\nWere playing baseball way back and uh and and people want to make out like it's some sort of criticism to Native Americans or when they were playing baseball the Native Americans were still roaming some of the the ...\nAnd it was I think at that time historically would have been a\nA complement if you will the exact a bright but\nAnd they were in fact and I listen to the rest of these names yeah for a while they were the superb us I Wish I think like a ... car you know and I sing tenor change named every year though without apparently then in in uh Nineteen Lebanon Nineteen twelve they were the trolley Dodgers that's where the chargers came from trolley Dodgers in Brooklyn\nAnd then I I don't know why they switched to the Robin such I mean I think the Dodgers makes more sense but they were the robin's from Nineteen fourteen and Nineteen thirty one\nThe Brooklyn Dodgers from thirty two to fifty four fifty five fifty six when they moved to Los Angeles and broke a lot of hours\nYeah I mean and then been Scalia was doing the broadcast for all those many years and uh I think he first started like in the forties the wrapped up last year I think it was his last season are doing the daily a Dodger games but I remember thinking here's a guy that ah\nThat showed up when uh the Brooklyn Dodgers moved west and then look at all of the uh you know sort of the baseball history of course that he was a you know chronicling\nOr on the radio for the next ...\nWell then I had only out of your dog you you you you really hit that curve ball very well\nWell I I Wish I had the uh remembered exactly what they had said but I they they started the broadcasts

these uh you know these ... such because after all the president's being blamed all over the place or recreating the atmosphere on all the ... what's your reaction to what you've seen\nWell my reaction I heard about the the charge a higher you\nAre sharing that I can share that with the urge to jump on to the anti Trump bandwagon are accusing him of a gang or showing strict gates that if people\nAre already written growing area or a ... a lot of what I'm told\nThat I spoke to a well stuff or wherever they expose a pill if I'm a ... and what\nCan you picture patch on when it comes to

[laughter] of one of them actually looks like shoddy job I don't even know what I'm fascinated by a show\nI think that's where I Wish there was someone else because the FBI yeah that's that's a very only game in town and hope or they weren't near Washington and stop with political non stretch of try that\nUh 'cause I could understand that Democrats wanted a clue that some lunar Czech Republic

this a theory and and Michael mentioned is and Rush Limbaugh or sort of blow to this yesterday on this program\nThen there may be another motivation about sending these it might have been some sort of

the media golf course and\nUh except for a couple of reporters are actually started that they actually are they found out that this was all a hoax tire thing was a hoax you also have a history\nOr for example in New York there was a talk show host at the time when say a liberal and he had planned that New York city police department broke into his house\nAnd I hear a little legal search while he was out at a really really ...\nUh I don't trust it came out that Italy is the one who did it and then of course being white\nTV shuttle I what I Would put it past the Democrats the Democrats Yoel

with Doug ... and Michael Patrick Leahy\nIn ... flip the switch from a um [noise]\n... this is talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W ELL lazy [noise]\nLevy and my\nArgument is is the Tennessee Starr Report welcome in on the bill Michael Patrick Leahy sitting here [noise] in is that like bomb gear man are ya I'd write you got I've\nGot a bond with Iran yeah we're hearing music grow and you know we're part of the media so of course it is likely possible that we could get one of these you know a packages\nThat apparently have bombs that don't go off and white powder that's not dangerous at least that's what National Review said\nYeah and and other media outlets New York times and others are saying these these almost like the movie bombs that are so over the top two or to look like an explosive device but that that aren't really as they attached these these clocks that don't even have\nA a an alarm setting that would would trigger any thing and this is just a bizarre story I mean it's it's over the top\nOver the top is the right description for the reaction of the mainstream media CNN Jeff Zucker to this with Neal evidence to to the I I Know I guess just guess with no evidence who do they blame for the arrival of these bond\nDonald Trump is literally been sitting in his in his basement in between you know these rallies across the country making these bombs and then this ugly delivering them to Los Angeles to New York to Maryland to DC I mean\nThe the ability to deliver these things is I think it'd be a hallmark\nThat has to be explored as well because they've almost simultaneously been delivered they they apparently are not ... canceled stamps that are indicative that somebody has actually been mailed so it looks like they've they've actually dropped these things off you've got in New York\nThousands of these CCTV cameras ... they're going to catch whoever has done this within the next twenty forty forty eight hours [noise]\nWell I I Hope they do because until then we're going to get this onslaught of Trump blaming based upon no evidence and you know a jumped in on this Ohio governor John ...\nHe's a Republican by the way these vitamin Trump to absolutely of course it's all Trump's fault because everything is Trump's fault\nYou know I can guarantee this when they catch this person and they will\nI guess it's a hundred percent a hundred percent as Christine Blasey Ford was a it's a hundred percent I but I Will go without hundred percent for\nFor the when Alex um ... the bottom line is this will not be a member of Congress having dispatched these this will not being elected Republican senator or congressman who was sent these packages unlike the ones who have been calling for violence on the other side of the aisle Maxine Waters former attorney general's US Senators\nYou've had actual Democrat elected officials calling for violence on the left\nYou you haven't had any Republicans calling for violence and you and you certainly are going to find that these bombs were manufactured in distributed and mailed by some us\nCongressman US Senator so this this comparison that somehow only one side's been promoting violence\nNo you've had actual public officials who have been promoting violence on the left and on and on the right there being blamed for what either a complete crazy person has done because if you were trying to actually send bombs that would explode and hurt people this is not how you would do it\nThis would be actually on the list of actually how not to do it\nThis has hallmarks of hoax and false flag\nAnd yet it also has hallmarks of crazy because if you're doing a hoax to draw attention they're gonna catch you and you're going to go to jail regardless of what your intent was so either somebody is is remarkably stupid and crazy which I think would would probably apply at least to some degree in this case\nA or it is a very sophisticated false flag operation by the left by Soros funded money to draw attention away from what are we not talking about today the migrant mob a fourteen thousand the Honduran hoard\nThe the mobs not jobs Crowder mobs let's take your jobs crowd that's marching through Mexico we're not talking about that\n... that was damaging the Democrats and there is also a strong possibility that this is intended to do exactly what it has done I mean when you go through all the things that are the hallmark of these packages\nThese suspicious packages because increasingly the reports and and um insider details being reported by the media indicate that they are the actual bombs\nThese packages are intended to distract into to draw attention away from what else has been going on in the news that has been hurting Democrats who was at a false flag is this a serious terrorist threat is this to distract our tensions here while real bomb packages are being spent elsewhere we\nDon't know a lot and yet the media in this his Derek coverage of oh my gosh now they drop\nOne article for about ... where are all of our on our who are\nArmed and well how about provide problem from her home from work on my car reporter for life and\nWhat I Know first hand

I. lazy and now back to the tendencies are born with the deal and Mike Lee [laughter] [noise]\nAnd looking back in the ... the Tennessee star reports the bill Michael Patrick Leahy seven three seven Ninety five twenty to the phone number that seven three seven nine five to two seven three seven W. L. A. C. if you want to join us on the phone lines and share your analysis your thoughts about these suspicious packages that have been delivered all over the country\nWith the without canceled stamps with with everything on this packaging designed to hey look at me\nThe the bombs apparently are not workable there they are loaded with shards of glass not be bees and and metal pieces to degrade sort of a shrapnel affected me pretty much everything you go down\nIn these in these devices is intended to draw attention not do harm now again is this intended to\nKind of like a magic act say hey look over here while they're you know doing something else somewheres it intended to distract us in the media from the marching hoard coming towards us from Mexico which was really doing damage to the Democrats is it just some crackpot\nWho's who's some looney tunes off his meds are her meds I mean what we don't have any real idea but the hysterics of the media particularly since it's it's targeting us they sent it to CNN and then you had the ISIS flag parity\nTag attached to at least the CNN CNN bomb that looked like it ISIS flag but it's it's part of a a gator done a comedian act so again this this thing is just bizarre\nSeven three seven nine five to to\nDo you think this is a false flag do you think this is some Democrat organization or crackpot looney Democrat who's who's trying to hurt the Republicans by making it look like they're doing this somebody had to spend some pretty good time to get this done\nAnd and for all these packages to hit exactly the same time and exactly the same what a coincidence if you and I go down to the mailbox and and\nMale three stamped letters or envelopes to three different people in three different parts of the country what do you think that coincidentally the likelihood is that they're gone all show up within one hour\nOr two hours at a disparate locations all over the country it it does not fit any logical rational pattern so\nSupposedly targeted with these devices so you know unless you're one to hurt you know some cork in the mail room unless you want to hurt some Secret Service agent who's providing the protective capabilities to do with the former President Clinton former President Obama\nAre members of of Congress in the Senate unless you're wanting to hurt some just innocent person they these things never would have gotten close to the intended targets\nIn the airport at the beginning of the show or if they're doing this to take away a coverage of the uh the mob coming up\nFrom Mexico are they studying media alec a recording last about the mob media coming up or they are they are they trying to distance themselves from the coverage of that I don't watch them that much I sort of depend on yeah let me

the national review according to police investigators don't even have the capacity to to do anything\nThat they wouldn't have exploded I mean they attached a clock to these these are only a half plum better than you remembered clock boy\nThe ... the kid yes that took apart yeah o'clock put it assembled ... into a like a box took it to school and then his parents sued unsuccessfully claiming that he was falsely accused falsely arrested for up for this bomb hoax that he did\nHis mom was a better looking bomb than this one by far and he actually got it into a school [laughter] so I mean maybe they investigated and talked to a clock boy in and find out the you know where was he and has he been involved anyway you've got the police investigating an eighth\nPotential bomb the and again\nThe white powder one of these I Can't remember which one it was one of the celebrities that that started the claiming that I got a package too it was a flash drive in a letter\nAnd yet another suspicious
