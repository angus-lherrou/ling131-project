CD and I'll tell you right at the end of our interview uh the vulnerable you could call to to get a copy of that Andrew thanks for joining us on the program beyond well dug in Michael this morning how are ya\nWell thank you dug in the morning Marco\nGreat to hear from you looking forward to what you have to say about this important topic\nYeah let's talk about doing a great issue or Andrew because after all a lot of people were concerned about the president or you know short of a take on the trade would there be terrorists and you saw this on the wall street and what do you what do you think is happening here and did you see yesterday some good news\nOh absolutely yeah we're under pricing our tax policy for for girl for the longest chard and like a good businessman I think you know Trump is writing to ship as it relates to what it costs for in a company in the sense we shouldn't be strict\nRight and so we're we're moving here we've got the Mexico I guess in in uh in working with Canada but what about China I mean isn't that sort of the big dog that we've got to do something about if if we're going to really a deal with this across the board\nOh no doubt we will I mean the Chinese are resistant you after manager and how much is going to cost him the way they look at it in terms of a competitive advantage China's been drinking a competitive advantage stretch long before most favored nation that is\nSo rare poster Trump has been the the over they could possibly get it and obviously I think we've given China's a leg up enough I think one of the time when they were developing country they were seen as a threat\nBut now they're competitive real threat to United States so it's about time they are the sort of on the up like I think Mr Trump is finally gotten the message across over my pick up a little longer to realize that\nUh people are fed oh we've got to start a trade war when you're a trade war\nLong as it there's no way that we could lose its good a good time to fight back I think\nYeah it seemed like we uh people were asking me on another show the other day how do we get here it was sort of a gradual thing was that it was ... maybe a move to a bit more globalism or the idea that some of the\nYou know the the corporations became more of a sort of a global environment in in that occurred and of course I mean I Know we we like the automobile manufacturers we in a situation where many of the company's game here but they\nA symbol the product perhaps here with American workers so there was this sort of mixing of a of a sort of a U.S and other nations right sort of a a global aspect to it absolutely\nAnd and you know the problem is I see it is I'm a fair trade carrying a guy in the free trade garlic I also as we said okay no character on anyone anywhere anytime no barriers to entry in terms of selling your product in a foreign market\nI'm sure most Americans would go along with that but this notion that\nWe can buy anything and you know all the would we want from Canada but they can't buy any dairy products from American far absurd and industry\nWho you're going to have a two way fair trade or\nYou can't have a one way street that's for sure until somebody like Canada one of our dearest allies that the president would pick on them yeah just like a knowledge and going out with your good probably every Thursday night and having dinner and drinks and you're always paying at some point you're going to come on man probably yeah\nThat's right I Want to hear sort of ... been I guess the Michael in this discussion a Michael did you have any concerns at all when all this sort of trade discussion began by the president while I have a\nA key question for injured I don't know if you have an answer to this but\nYou know there were all these reports were ... the the point you just made about free trade not really being free trade in terms of even dealing with our friends in Canada\nAnd President Trump he was tough he was hard he ... and and and so are the people in Canada that trade representative was gonna whining about him being unfair and yet\nAnd yet a deal and got done I looked to me pretty much like at the very last minute like just before midnight Andrew loo it pretend you were sort of like a fly on the wall looking in the ... what do you think it was going on as a as the Canadians caved\nWell they were there were watching their watch I mean the other one we had an expiration that was of course the problem if we didn't have a good you know the idea that we the only way to kick the president can move this for gender which I support by the way the tariffs and I I think we ran our country for a hundred and fifty years on tariffs\nWe've never had an income tax and kill like he'd Thirteen\nIt so I imagine there was a hard line in the room\nYou know not to suggest that oh I don't want to drink or eat dinner with you any more but he I I just don't want to pay for it every week that's all ... and I think it would actually commonsense took over the Canadians way of thinking they are a huge trading partner the United states and it it was time to pay their fair share\nYou know my dad was born in Canada and when I was a kid we live right across the border\nIn upstate New York and we go to visit my grandfather on the farm and in Hemings for Quebec back and forth all the time and and and I grew up with having a very positive relationship positive understanding of Canada and and people in Canada but I tell ya\nI my sense is the Canadian delegation was just shocked\nIf you are as mad about literature as we are showing the great American Queen them in two thousand seven over a hundred and fifty two thousand volunteers and a hundred percent of Tennessee's ...\nTennessee do your part and

Bush\nHas been burning up the phones and and calling on her and she's been targeted by the left and she's irritated by their tactics\nRightfully so so if that's if that's how it turns out or you have mentioned vote yes and Collins' vote gestures fifty forty eight and it doesn't matter because parents can break the tie I don't know about Murkowski did you see that picture\nOf a Senator Dianne Feinstein basically physically intimidating of course she's eighty four I don't know how committed and you can be\nAn eighty four but leaning ... yeah yeah to intimidate because I don't know about ... I didn't\nSee I didn't see that was a so she's a she was trying to intimidate Senator Murkowski here\nThe same way the Democrats tried to and successfully intimidated or Jeff Flake although you never know how much they have is an act\nAnd we keep our guys out of an elevator ... if you'd get them up the blower without having to deal with that\nWe had our guys I I don't know I mean it looks more like ... he looks more like a you know Chris Coons puppy dog to me but hey baby\nOh they were they were yelling at a buck sixty minutes people didn't see that I mean and they were talking about there was a fishing trip or something they went on and our noses safari went on a you know so far you know I don't want to hear about that and I want to know right I Want to know about the\nYou know how you're you're coming to a conclusion and make a decision to hear about what's happening could not you know here's the goods not open minded about this you know Blake is acting like he's really open minded\nThat I don't think he is not only is he is either but but Kuhn isn't either\nI think it's like it's just really unreliable and flaky and I think all of this maybe you never know right he's not up for reelection he hates absolutely hates despises deep tests Donald Trump\nOr and he's playing to the left wing crowd or a as on the other hand you know Lindsey Lindsey Graham you know probably got a ticket to buy for it if the guy [laughter] right [laughter] well I mean\nBlake said yesterday that he the bills like demand without a country was asked that question did it feel like I'm without a party I'm I'm a man without the country because ah as he was asked on sixty minutes you know the Democrats do like you the Republicans don't like you that is true I mean a Trump supporters don't like it I mean\nHe really is a person that has nowhere to go so what's what's the game what exactly what is he playing is he really\nAre so concerned about judge Kavanaugh but he's added this drama or was he the guys who were the instrument maybe by the leadership to provide some cover brother or Republicans you also a ... maybe we haven't talked about that that are out there and they you know they're

journal Wall Street journal yesterday was\nAwfully good it it goes to a fundamental issue of fairness I'm sure there's nothing worse or in a person's life that a sexual assault on west\nIs being accused of sexual assault that you didn't do in front of a hundred million people and that's what we that's what we've got here and it's it's destroying judge Kavanaugh's reputation which up until ten days ago was among the best of it\nAnd you've got the increasingly they're just\nWhat the what the media will report we've got Jane Doe anonymous letters that Kamala Harris is now thinking about we got this alleged bar scuffle thirty three years ago where he's accused of throwing some ice at a guy uh I I don't think it was one of those big box you know it was probably ice in a drink so it's there is no\nRational fair basis for even what the media is reporting\nThis\nYou know there's always been reports you know the what people are looking is\nJudge Kavanaugh has been subjected\nTo six background checks over the last twenty six years in connection with the various federal position she has\nAnd those background checks are expensive the FBI goes in and says you know Steve yeah what do you think about Steve skill and ask a hundred questions about Steve guilt and they ask questions like does he live beyond just means and I know when I was going through the process one of my friends\nAnswered well don't we all but there\nThere are all sorts of questions and it picks up all sorts of rumors all sorts of here say so what's different\nToday is it suddenly all this stuff is in the social media within seconds and people tend to believe that\nThe uh the the Senate is moving ahead in a bipartisan way doesn't get much attention I mean it's huge news this week that would have\nNormally occupied front pages a new deal with Canada and Mexico that apparently will resolve the the tariffs disputes that those countries and then the opioid issue that has been captivating and hurting people for a long time the Senate with ... year legislation is going to move ahead today to deal with that\nYeah we we believe today or tomorrow but we're ready to send the bill to the president at this is the most\nSerious public health epidemics that our country has and it's it's very difficult to deal with everybody says well we should have a moon shot for opioids and the problem is we just can't\nGive this problem to a federal agents who see and say go do it in ten years what we've got is something that has to be done in every community doctor's office families et cetera so we've got proposals from Seventy two different senators everything stopping and all at the border from coming through the mail this stuff that's\nFifty times more powerful than opioids pills for Seventy percent increase in deaths from Fenton all to\nTrying to find a non addictive pain medicine you know there are lots of people listening to you right now who\nLive with pain and they leave something and we need we need to find something that's not addictive ... also another example is to is to allow the food and Drug Administration to tell manufacturers you could always sell opioid pills or in a blister pack of three five or seven\nSo you don't have a bottle of sixty and then take it home and put it in your bathroom medicine cabinet and your teenager gets it takes it to a party and somebody's dead the next morning\nThe challenge is to find that balance isn't as senator between people who need the medication people who need the painkiller and those that are abusing it I mean I I hate it when I go into the pharmacy and I have to show my photo ID to buy cold medicine because they think I'm going to run out and somehow figure out how to make math\n... no you're right that that's that that's the balance it will probably overreact here because the opioid problem is so damaging you know a third of the babies born in the new metal in your natal\nCenter in Johnson City or are withdrawing from opioids because their mothers that we'll probably we'll probably go too far and the people who are living with intense pain won't be able to get medicine that they need so\nUh it is a matter of balance but but it's a terrible problem and it's in every community in Tennessee\nAnd it's this this kind of bipartisanship that that should be being heralded and and the fact that you've got both Democrats and Republicans joining in this legislation\nAre already in the house has has has passed but yet you've got the hypocrisy of politics you've got Chuck Schumer spending literally millions of dollars attacking Marsha Blackburn on the the opioid legislation that she co sponsored along with Democrats and Republicans\nThat Chuck Schumer voted for and yet he's running

doesn't aged well [laughter] I didn't even have to be sure to check out that story as a as Google again showing their political bias to use and it's why President Trump and others are wanting a full investigation into\nInto what these big corporations are doing in terms of their influence we we we worry about Russian collusion but let's worry a little bit about the collusion between the Democratic party\nAnd and the media outlets that are that are communicating in a way that it's completely unfair and and not responsible\nIn the high tech companies Facebook Google Twitter go down the list\nWhat other stories and and folks that I listen to me for a while I'm no I'm a history junkie I mean I I'm I'm a history nerd I Love history and we've got a great story that's up on a tendency star dot com about the the state\nOf Franklin that didn't exist didn't exist for long never really moved all the way into existence but every Tennessee at one point was ...\nIt is to have the state of Frank one that was coming out of the territory that was North Carolina before it became Tennessee and and kind of an interesting bit of history\nTwelve counties which include you know we're junk where President Trump was last night and just the city and he's in Washington County that's Washington County souls and county ... county but as part of the twelve county area that was part of the the the\nState of Franklin that never really quite existed but you know we have a a columnist Gregory Watson who writes for us weekly on the constitution Gregory is the only American in history who who's singular efforts\nA help to uh give a constitutional amendment passed the twenty seventh amendment and what is the twenty seventh do it basically it says this Congress cannot vote raises for itself\nHas to be it can vote raises for the next Congress but not this comfort hound our founding fathers overlook that one was in the bill up for it was in the first bill of rights was one of the twelve amendments it it never got past but there was no end to it\nAnd Gregory Watson was a student at the University of Texas in the early Nineteen eighty she was reading a book he saw that he said well it's a good idea why did they ever pass it\nAnd they know nobody really ever knew a and then he said well is there a deadline and there's no there isn't he spent the next ten years of his life talking to state legislatures around the country\nAnd it became basically got passed was ratified\nNeeded two thirds vote from ... states you've got\nIt got you've got to do to you know\nIt was passed by enough states will be in this now\nAnd the members of the constitution is all because Gregory Watson was in the library one day and said hey let's do this he spent ten years working on it but so he wrote that story for us it's tendency star about how the\nTwenty seventh amendment got passed and it will use so good we said why don't you write weekly about the constitution and he wrote about the state of Franklin which is interesting enough twelve counties in East Tennessee including Johnson City where President Trump was last night you know we were part originally of North Carolina but in Seventeen Ninety four\nOr they want it to the people living there and wanted to break away from North Carolina they declared themselves to state\nThey had to get permission from the continental Congress to become a state well the continental Congress never got around to it so it was sort of in limbo until Seventeen Ninety six after course our constitution was ratified in Seventy and eighty nine so they're hanging in limbo\nThey want to be a separate state the Congress doesn't allow it the Congress does allow those twelve counties to be part of Tennessee not North Carolina in Seventeen Ninety six and so that\nAs Paul Harvey used to say is the rest of the story\nAnd it's relevant today because you've got some discussion about whether Puerto Rico should become the fifty first state of the president saying he's not really in favor of that in and voters in Puerto Rico a couple of times have rejected it as well they kind of like their special status where they get the benefits and don't have some of the responsibilities\nThe she's ready to update yes also needs to stay good also has come up in California where the proposals that have been rejected to turn it into six days three
