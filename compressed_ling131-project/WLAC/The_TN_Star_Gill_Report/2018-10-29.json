L. A. C. welcome back five thirty three our time of year the Tennessee Starr Report the early\nEdition we call it the Steve you'll warm up show Steve will be here after six o'clock All right let's talk about it a I've had this conversation Michael with\nAh friends uh other Republicans or Democrats you name it that the the people who support Donald Trump just part of a sort of a ... a movement is that what Howard Dean is saying here is that the I mean it or is he just insulting just doing so what do you think it is\nWell I you know Howard Dean a such a great stared of of morality [laughter] former chairman of the Democratic\nNational League made and scream at is that time and uh you can be good at it I guess\nYeah famously a ended his own quest for the presidency by an ill advised just screamed fast [laughter]\nYeah 'cause people were worried about ... in the rye enemy or primary yeah yeah it was scary actually when he when he did that and it that people were like wait a minute this guy is out of control it and he's talking about Donald Trump\nNow he's an out of control guy and you know his story is he was born to a very wealthy New York city family and uh and then move to Vermont He was part of this\nWhole oh I Know a creation of a new Vermont a far left\nProgressive so many of them from New York City that happened in the seventies and eighties you know when I was growing up across way sham plane from Vermont in the little town called Plattsburgh New York's\nA Vermont was very conservative\nOr the old saying was remember when FDR had the a of a landslide in Nineteen thirty six and only two states went Republican and the saying was\nAs Maine goes so goes Vermont and it was you know it was farm country and very conservative folks it boosts where Calvin Coolidge was born you ended up becoming moving\nDownloading ... mallard which had been right on the Bernie Sanders the home of a your cousin I\nAm I just couldn't cousin who is as far left in in the loony sorry 'cause how has the right I mean what has an allowance dean and Bernie Sanders\nUm so you know you have to put that in context and the other thing about this they have made it a I'm sort of a a ... they they have made it sort of a a almost cause I religious a battle between good and evil here's what Howard Dean had to say about that\nThe struggle of out from that this has now become a struggle about good\nOf the United states is evil [laughter]\nWow that's amazing that you know no matter how much\nWe disagree in the past with the you know people like rock Obama we thought the you know his a burnout leftist policies at times or you know we're not good for the country I don't think I remember Republicans certainly not elected people or are people who had been elected saying that the\nThe bronco bottom was evil right or even Bill Clinton for that matter even with all his shenanigans that he did back in the nineties so we now have struggled verse good versus evil and when Donald Trump is evil\nThis is why the leftist protestors feel like they could do anything they want because they claim this moral superiority now it's entirely falls because their policies are are very much state is very much a let me ask\nYou this oh Michael because it along that line because ... is Trump\nIs as President Trump sort of also followed end of this where he has called the ... the you know ... named a number of people who your enemies are in such a bitter enemies you'd think that if that has also a lead to this or you think was it the the good versus evil argument from the left first and then Donald Trump saying that what do you think\nWell I mean has he called them enemies or is he just called them the opposition I mean clearly\nCovered enemies yeah I mean I I I'd have to go back and look you know and and everything but at least that that's a I was thinking he had but the\nAh I'm just wondering because this is so different than in the past right where we were talking about our politics and it wouldn't be necessarily good versus evil or if we did we were joking about it and some you know some contacts there um\nBut they call the president evil I mean that's that's going very very far\nWell well here's what Mike Pence had to say about good and evil in the United states\nThere is no place in America\nOr anti Semitism and this evil [noise]\nWhere you go that's evil that does that mean that that's boiling out really evil there I mean I mean the president you don't have to visit a winning the campaign was going on and uh you know some of my my Republican friends distressed that Donald Trump was leading in the\nIn the in the primaries and such and a discussion about you know the people that support him or whatever the present my view of Trump is always man\nBut here's a guy that's all the country going the wrong direction\nAnd the Donald Trump a good uh is is the good things are the laws of this individual here he looked at the country so they were going down a rat holed or whatever term you want to use and decided because Donald Trump personality is such that he was the only one that can fix it\nBut he is the guy that uh you know is not going to stand by and watch the country just go down in the tank and he believed because he does believe is that the he alone is the guy that can turn things around and got into the race now that may be right it may be wrong about it but that's not the motivation of evil person if I'm right\nWell here's the thing you can you think of anybody other than Donald Trump who could withstand this huge media onslaught this huge set of attacks from the far left from Democrats who could withstand all those attacks\nI'm an ex smoker [noise]\nMy only advice [laughter] never\nIf youre trying to quit smoking

glittering new at clearing new dot org\nBecause brake light suck time favorite traffic coming up on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W well Lacey the Tennessee Starr Report early edition with Doug ... and Michael Patrick Leahy\nPresident Trump on the death penalty they're talking about obviously the shooting in Pittsburgh\nOr over the weekend of the Jewish synagogue that uh you know we go for years and years sometimes I've covered a a gauge where an individual is convicted of murder and um you know and here they are many years later and they're still awaiting a the actual carrying out of the Senate because of all the number of appeals and this and that and\nYou know this has been a sort of a frustration because the ... corps wants to knock down the death penalty\nIn the in its entirety and uh but the president or very strongly I'm saying that we need to move up or step up the process I don't know I Wonder how we can do that you know we have so many appeals into him such Michael it you know that really does linked in this whole process between a conviction and the eventual carrying out of a sudden it\nI think at this particular case the U.S attorney in western Pennsylvania\nHas made it clear that he's going to go after this alleged shooter and uh and well he should I I Will bring up ... did you see what the far left Democrat mayor of Pittsburgh said\nAbout the proper steps to stop this sort of thing he said he criticized the president who would also said that ah ah is this sort of thing would not have had this kind of this level of outcome had an armed security been at the synagogue\nAt that time and the far left Democrat mayor of Pittsburgh says oh we don't want to do that well\nA common sense says that would make an awful lot of sense to do that don't you think\nYeah and I'm I'm sure that he has some kind of security when he's out in the public writing so he should back away from that as well I mean they hit the piracy on\nA beach kind of event is amazing obviously it may have helped if there had been a security there may not have because the security I Would have been the first one gun down but at least it would have been an opportunity to ah to confront the shooter and that didn't happen so I mean but to criticize the president but that doesn't doesn't really make any sense to me well but\nHere you may recall here in in Knoxville\nI think a couple of years ago a crazy person stepped into church and started shooting people and uh I think three or four people died as a result\nUm and uh what has happened since that time in much of the south much Tennessee you go to church on Sunday or you will see an armed security guard there at least one or trying to say I think\nI think too and you know in a art concealed carry permits or whatever right at the church and one of those areas of top limit tried to carry so um you know that that may be should be re looked at as a at least in some states it's a\nWell let me tell you something I I I I I don't think that's the law necessarily prohibits concealed carry\nA in church in Tennessee ... college would do that but I I I think that uh uh many members of church congregations uh do do carry a when they go to church up for this very reason\nWell I mean that's what I'm saying it ended up well I think but you know public gathering and they just maybe it depends on the the definition of it [laughter] I Know when when I got in mind\nIf we're going to take the guns with the gun grabber started screaming for before the shooting was even over a if you're going to take the guns from those who are innocent millions of millions of Americans didn't shoot anybody yesterday with their\nLawful guns they're they're legal guns and yet you've got the left already screaming we need to take the guns um the response of of punishing people who perform lawfully legally because of the bad actions of one person is akin to saying well you know my neighbor\nUm ... got a DUI last week and we're going to go round up everybody else's cars\nOr ... or or if we're going to actually go after folks for misusing and abusing their constitutional rights\nBecause somebody does let's go after the people who actually miss used and abused their constitutional rights so the the district were Maxine Waters lives should see their right to vote taken away because they have misused their right to vote\nBy voting for Maxine Waters that is actually more direct nexus to behavior and punishment than taking my gun because some nut case in Pittsburgh did and yet the left doesn't see any any rational reason\nTo what to limit their reaction to these people doing bad things to only limited to their decision to do bad things\nThe problem we have in the country right now I Want to me is that we have many brands of crazy out there Steve many brands\nWasn't and we've seen we've seen diverse particular brands of crazy do this sort of thing you know the the left was not quick to blame Bernie Sanders noted Bernie Sanders except blame\nWhen one of his followers one of his volunteers actually went out with a gun and shot up a congressional baseball practice of Republicans targeting Republicans shooting at almost killing Steve police\nCongressman from Louisiana you didn't see the left blaming\nBernie Sanders and and the Democrats for that shooting and yet they are quick to blame Donald Trump for this shooting in Pittsburgh where the guy was an anti Trump her go figure absolutely crazy or another brand of crazy we saw on display\nAnd and a lot of coverage but we're going to talk about it in this next segment at Marsha Blackburn a vet in Nashville\nWith the race Stevens a cabaret cabaret with our newfound conservative friends or at
