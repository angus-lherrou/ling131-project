[noise] and I ... a or not I ate a lot at one time and then like I I don't know how ... and ... like you know I haven't had any major health bill required break with it but\nYou know I'm pretty young and I you know\nI Want I Want to know what what you thought my general risk factor is that how exile\nWell I mean for the for the most part right now if you're near you kind of you're almost your mid twenties\nIt's not that big of a deal but it just never when I say not that big of a deal your body's pretty resilient that age but\nYou know the same time it's never good on your liver you know to drink that much you know obviously it put large amounts of food and at one time your body can handle that pretty well I mean you want to do you like one big meal a day and maybe another\nYou know small meal or something it's not ideal\nBut your body can handle it has it's a much junk food all the time fast food and all that yeah I mean that's gonna that'll catch up with you\nAgain you don't really see cancer and those sorts of things early on you see those later\nSo and it takes about ten years for a tumor to form the Bonnie I'm not saying the bad eating habits and what you're doing right now is gonna causal then I'm just saying that in general it takes quite a bit of time that's why you see people really started getting medications and\nTheir life changing when they get into like their forties late forties and fifties and because it takes about that long those poor habits over a long period of time to start causing the body to break down enough to to cause that kind of thing so\nThat's just that's just my first thought to you but why the alcohol every night and you just treat you like it you're hooked on it you just once the nail\nOn the line I went to college and it's in our atmosphere you know walk ship people dying and now I'm not I'm not working for the for the visual adrift during a coping for just a way to\n... to ... you know I I don't fear and every night or anything but you know\nOne night without at least a couple of drinks is very rare you know [noise] where ever read your part of what I Do I feel like if I start with the food\nYou know can I add your life I I I I I don't see like a big adjustment on your future because after regular part of what I [noise]\nYeah I get it but I mean at the same times are you happy doing that or you just if it was healthy for your body you do it all the time right\nYeah absolutely\nYeah it's it's not I mean if you can break those habits now is probably gonna be better because what you'll see is you know as you get older and older people keep doing these this kind of pattern it will start making some pretty negative impacts on you later this can cause cognitive thinking issues potentially can cause real ah issues of the liver\nAnd that kinda thing plus man I mean you know what it alters\nYour body chemistry in a negative way you know me and make you make you feel good and all that what if what if you want without it what would you deal with would you do things I Would you feel down and out like depressed what would you feel like\nWell I'm the occasional by where I don't have a drink you know I I actually noticed myself you're still unclear I Know I'm a I'm an educated person I Know what I'm doing but uh I\nThe standpoint you you can never really down their view on diet and ... you know sort of get rid of it all out working\nAnd you know how long how long will not be able to stay in the habit I guess I'm more worried about\nI wouldn't be a stain it man I Would just change it [noise]\nI mean if anything cut it down to just drinking on the weekends at first\nAnd give yourself a break during the week\nYour body can handle that fairly well a lot of people do that for long periods of time [noise] I just you know I I'm not a big not a big alcohol guy just never [noise]\nWhen it comes to your health and ... it's a depressant so you know Everytime you drink at your depressing every system in your body so that's why you say on the occasional time where you don't break you feel clear\nWill that clears your body getting back into balance and that's what I Would
