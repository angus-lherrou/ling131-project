makes a big difference it said to banish belly fat is a great article you want to drop the belly fat vigorous aerobic exercise to just jogging or brisk walking beats weight or is this is trading that's what a new study shows\nSo if you're overweight or mildly obese and want to lose the fat belly fat visceral fat or liver fat and here's an interesting thing that says that\nThe visceral fat the Oregon fat can be almost more dangerous than just the regular belly fat\nAnd they're saying that the aerobics training was better than resistance training\nThis was ... a PHD and exercise is a physiologist at Duke University there was a new study done in the American Journal of physiology endocrinology metabolism\nThat belly fat fixed study details they say this robot training group exercise by walking on a treadmill an incline they put a quibble at twelve miles of jogging at eight percent maximum heart rate each week\nAnd the resistance training group did three sets of eight to twelve repetitions on weight training machines three times a week the combination group did both workout study lasted for eight months\nSlept focused on visceral fat is located deep within the body around the stomach and Phil spaces between internal organs\nThat could that like the inside that and it's the one that strongly linked to heart disease diabetes and other health problems is different from the subject tiniest that which is just underneath the skin kinda more that belly fat and that's what expands the waist lines\nBut they found that the aerobic group did better now here's the deal\nThat's great that they've done this study and wanted to read this to you because\nStill do this surge training that we have which is more of hormonal training is stronger of a physiological response for Bernie body fat even in this\nSo you can go bust your can walk on the treadmill for forty five minutes that's fine you can go out and jog for an hour you can actually get more of a result\nIn twenty to thirty minutes of busting your can even twelve to Fifteen minutes they've done some studies\nNow there's some workouts of saying five minutes\n\nCan do really really well and you can get a response and you can get a decent response of the body but you need a little bit more than that from the research that I've done but it doesn't take much and it's about the intensity it's about having those surges\nOf higher intensity and then resting for just a moment and then surging again and just just really hitting at heart a lot of research on that and you increase growth hormone increased testosterone so just think about it's about training smart about working out smart and you don't have to spend a lot of time you know in our busy schedules busy life many people don't have an hour\nDon't ever want to spend an hour because of increased a lot of negative hormones like cortisol\nCivil war\nNo one wants to admit it but we are right now I Believe in a civil war\n\nAnd it's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it is happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs that two sides fighting against each other even though there are two sides of liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're seeing if somebody's asymmetrical we're seeing something that's a patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups\nAnd we have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support your attention occasional ... and it is leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points about things like gun control\nThings like immigration\nAnd it's not just that that were radicalized that were radicalized with TV shows Roseanne next to remark immediately we we turn into a political football they bring back Murphy\nBrown it's a political football capitalistic kneeling a political football\n\nYou know we have a hurricane right now heading for the Gulf Coast Michael now will be about loss of life it won't be about property damage it'll be about whether or not it's global warming this is another ... ready to\nRally the troops to political or something and radicalized people it's happening\n\nAnd you say well quite no one asked me to join the war no they're not going to ask you to join the war is going to ask you to pick a side because the war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we so obviously he thinks like this will know if I say that they're going to see things like that no I'm not taking any side I Would say in general\nThis is what we're saying itself composing there's no official or to be called\nThe war is that all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything but it doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identify the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identified after the war and that's what historians do\n\nWhen you take a look at all of the things that we could say were little skirmishes ... and little ideological a fight so we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas\nAnd what's going on here in my my city is it is just it's terrifying\nAll fronts\nAren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as rigorous missing the signs of networked violence thinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us to the\nMany actors working to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood the cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocateurs Olive Garden plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks we have a Islam we have a border skirmishes where you have ever has Thirteen we ... I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this is why George Soros is always the guy that being said well he's funding move on these funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics if you think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments and now they're fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths\nFactions products like mushrooms taking different forest but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\n\nOr seeing chaos accelerated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds of I mean look\nWe have a healthy immune response obviously for the local and national authorities\nThe goal of the civil war is not death but the fragmentation of the republic the goal of the global assist or will America down to manage will collect this and this would easily your heart and the resolve of an increasingly authoritarian world government and would provide more reason to implement smart city infrastructure in order to maintain full spectrum control\n\nWhen I said get ready for anything prepare for anything I wasn't getting when I was announced Jones I said prepare for a war footing I'm not kidding I don't know bits brinkmanship with another country I don't know if it's saber rattling I'm no it's right here\n\nBut after what happened in Portland last friday stores were told to close because there was going to be a flash Rob because the gang truce was going to go in and Rob the stores and a local local store where anti fought directing traffic the police looking on people being harassed if he didn't go to the direction of anti fought told them to go\n\nMy wife Janine was a victim of police brutality when she had a friend were adamant local McDonalds\nWitnessing the arrest of a man who was screaming and agony Janine has a background in in public safety and she said this man needs an EMT this man needs an ambulance the officer cuff during the chest with his forearm\n\nHit her right when she has her mastectomy\n\nAnd she couldn't believe that this officer did this to her but she was heartbroken over trying to do the right thing and she was met with violence by the officer\n\nYou know it wasn't I mean it was the hurt and it was the bruised it was all that but she felt like this is my community and it's falling apart that's the only thing that she could think about me she was raised in the northwest and she loves the Pacific northwest and this is something that she can't believe what's happening\nHere and I thought it was just going to get worse because virtually every major institution right now in this country is being radicalized you're being reshaped by the radicalization of our public lives you can look at it the social media section you could look at it\nOr you could look at it on a regular media\nI mean ever since the president was elected reporters on boats\nIs there to back up and I'm sure we're not going to name the guy's name we're not going to talk about they were just going to say it happened and there are a lot of good officers but no should it be to be taken care of so that's how it goes there are good officers out there to really fix seven three thirty seven hundred in Tripoli except for three thirty seven hundred will be\nBack\nMine mine\n\n\nIn the DC area make over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trained tomorrow dot com or call a\n\nTo hear their Berlin to be drawing the line I mean\n\nOn and on and on and off\nYou are listening to ground zero that it was called but I Believe ... three thirty seven hundred\nShoveling six seven three three of them you know my I\nI don't again and and that's the thing I I don't understand\nThough this weekend there was a protest in my neighborhood downtown\nAnd ah and the father was there and they were directing traffic and people were\nTelling people were to go there were blocking traffic tell me more to go and if they wouldn't they were abusing them and the boys just sat there and let it happen\n\nYou know I Want to know why I Wonder I Wonder why you know people I mean if you look at some of the videos I had them on my Facebook page and I said to myself why does this happened in my community why is this happening in my town\n\nAnd I said you know be prepared for anything I wasn't prepared to see I mean for the first time in my life I was angry about what I was seeing because I saw this old man probably scared out of his wits being abused being yelled at having a baton bashing his car\nI mean it it's not just the mobs it's not just the anti fights it everybody everybody's pissed off everybody's radicalized up something stop being so damn radicalized\n\nThat radicalized we might as well call it's a civil war in this country and and it's not because we have a union and Confederate see we have several groups that are pissed off but want to be heard to want to be known that will do anything in their power to do it\n\nGo to Jack in California hijacker on ground zero yeah so right now we're in a unconventional so or at least that you\nKnow it's an unconventional all it's a civil war this is how civil wars are fought in in modern times it's not about dying it's about fragmenting it's about I mean some people will die and some people have died because we've had these terrorist attacks we've had shootings we had all these things going on and no one's going to call it it's a civil war I mean what what what do you expect that show\nIf you compare it to our first civil\nCivil war was the first civil war this is an unconventional what you want a Confederate union you're not you don't get a get it it's not going to conventional this the way civil wars are fought in the twenty first century\nWell I think a President Trump acknowledged it when he referred to the angry mobs and\nWell and that's another thing in a civil war President Trump has no power unless he wants to enforce a sedition what'd you haven't done so I mean he has in civil wars there are no power the president will now be park as we want to do what they want anyway and the argument would I Want to\nClaim that the doors that looked like a scene out of the walking dead is exactly right\nBut you know what's interesting is some of the tactics that are being used like a giving out the first cell phone numbers of people in the address is yep and confronting people at their whole set restaurants in the halls of Congress\nRight and this is this is ... this is conversion theory because what it does is it can ... people over to be the same way it starts the domino effect if one person decides to harass another person or another person or another but it all happens\nIt happens it happens I mean you know a ... wouldn't mind Maxine Waters said to harass people she should have been taken in and she should've been talk to but she didn't she got away with it and now people are doing it\nWell Maxine Waters and uh what's the guy's name Corey Booker ... Corey\nI don't know anybody who sit there and encourage this type of a yes\nThey've been encouraging this type figure\nYou know immediately to the media doesn't to encourage you to\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because\nIf you look in our past oh remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated mhm and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Nashville", "day": "10"}
