about the uh information and what I Need to do and I just don't really know where it again or how to start my die like that or change my dad\nWill fi bro as we call it there's still a big debate I mean if you ask positions the older the older physicians\nBecause fiber males is fairly recent diagnosed I mean a new category diagnosis or if you ask older physicians they'll say they'll have mixed opinions I said well I don't really know if it's a diagnosis or not the younger ones where you know I think we're so used to it and we get trained with it that it's just yeah OK you have fiber oh\nBut there's so many mixed feelings with it because it happens as a result with depression\nAnd I I guess well let me let me put me rephrase that happens a lot with low serotonin okay 'cause not everybody would low serotonin is depressed or feels depressed pay\nAnd low serotonin you could not feel depressed and have a good outlook on life but your body aches all the time and that low serotonin a lot of time just what's causing the fiber of type symptoms well\nThere's some test you can have done your doctor could check it a lot of times is the first line of treatment is doing a an anti inflammatory\nThat's one of the first lines of treatment is to do that\nYou really have to look at\nWhat you could do to build those levels backup serotonin levels there's a lot of things in your diet that can raise it up five had ... trip to fend for example is something that can help but also eating higher levels of protein chicken fish eggs are keeping that as a priority and you're dying can make a difference\n\nSo that's a big key so you have to look at just some of the basics of what you want to focus in on the amount of happy to do it to show you one of those things with with fiber miles you\nThat you have to look at is that you can rebalance the body so many times okay you're not stuck and it can be in and make it through fatty acids efficiency for example I mean that's that's
