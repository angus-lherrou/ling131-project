I I Know you're worried about him I can hear that okay and I understand\nWhen somebody has a ... addiction and they're they're they're in they're stuck in a behavior whatever that is okay if if they're stuck in that then he's got to get to a place where\nHe can overcome it okay and and he has to want this so even though it's the ... we're dealing with fluid that can be dangerous somewhat to the body he has to want cars deliver itself\nIs not going to get better unless you unless he stops you understand that right so it's it's one of those deals where it'll continue to decline unless he's willing to step it up\n\nSo he has to really jump in and and make a difference in that realm\nSo I Would encourage you to to make sure just to see if if he is in a place where he can\nGet some help is if it takes counseling if it takes support groups if it takes whatever to get him into a place where he's willing to to get better to ... to not be stuck where he is I mean all that really matters and that's one of the big key is that you have to look at\nFor him is is seeing if he if he wants to get into that place because if not is it just be a spiral it'll be just the ... the same old same old same old same old same old it'll be continuing and it'll be all the time you got to get him to a place where he's ready to to get out of that place and and really begin to thrive again and do well\nSo that's a that's a big key gotta focus got to get him focus got to get into a place where he can do well and not be stuck where he is because it's tough that's not easy where he ... the place he's in\nIs not easy and play season is is challenging to say the least\nSo\nNeat you got to get him to a place where he can he really do well and I'll tell you having a physician on board with your family doctor maybe an addiction specialist\nIf it'll be helpful but he's got to understand where he is with his health too okay that that makes a big difference has got to understand the level that his health is in and where it's headed\nBecause if if he doesn't understand that then that's going to be a whole situation by itself gun to understand that and will help any way we can if you want to you knew where nutritional type areas that he can look into to get information down in the body but it's going to take it's going to take some radical help his needs eat physical one on one help with someone\nTo really get to that place he needs to really cause the fluid and deliver all that is I mean I have to tell you this it's almost secondary\n'cause all that's going to continue those are just symptoms of byproducts of poor choices his lifestyle is what's ruining his own hill and I know you love them and and I know that's why you're calling but until that\nGets taken care of that's why I'm a huge firm believer I think medicine all we're doing for the most part is playing catch up I really do I think our if we can get to you and your lifestyle choices every single day and modify that I think you can unravel most\nHealth challenges that we face today all the way from diabetes heart disease the whole nine yards I think we can knock out most of it if we can if I can get your lifestyle under control if I can get you making good choices if I can get you going in the right direction then all this other stuff is just I mean again it's it's it's not tough\nMedicine managers and it manages in an amazing way I'm telling you some of the best I've ever seen our school systems training systems are absolutely amazing\nBut I think we need to spend more time getting to people in the front end to modify their choices every day that is the absolute key triple eight to eight three Seventy seven to this triple eight to eight three Seventy seven to you're listening to on call radio right here on the ... network go to in shape network dot com\nLet's go to Janet Hi Janna\nMarried air ... hurts your cause I can answer and it's a ... for that\nAlso [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] oh\nMichael Jackson said he wants to go to the moon really so he can borrow\nYou want them all [noise] just say the word now are are\nWhy the U.S government\nHe\nWhich you're surrounded by\nLike I Wonder\nI call this the one area and\nWhere the radio show that keeps you up late [noise] like the ...\nSay especially a lot of all the driveway listeners that I\nWas stuck in the driveway listen to the program the want to leave your car do you I wouldn't even [noise]\nCool things to talk about the triple a six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nBuddies Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nGo to Michael in Oregon Hi Michael you're on ground zero\nBy longtime first I think you you know all\nAbout it I just uh each on your show but I'm about that ... that if you think about it what what more genius way to bluffs somebody thinking he got more technology than yeah\nYou do need to make money right\nWell I don't know if they get or not I'm just saying if if they did it was genius anyhow\nWellbeing about this a T Barnes was on the show when they just couldn't be classified some ox carts project ... card with the ... project very fifty one you know he told us he said that their new in the satellites were coming overhead so they had to go out on the tarmac and they had to put cardboard planes on the tarmac to give the Russians the idea that they're working on some sort of an aircraft\nOh I remember something you know they used they used to put a fake aircraft that big car board airplanes they used to put on the on the runways there if you wanted to fool the Russian\nYeah yeah I remember that\nSo I mean so there are plenty of they're putting fake cardboard planes on the tarmac fifty one that could easily uh put together some you know grace soil put it somewhere on the sound stage\nAnd uh and make it happen they they could easily do that I mean I don't\nSee why it it's beyond the pale whipping they couldn't set something up or do close ups of a of a moon modeled just like they did a you know for Star Wars I mean what Lucas did was basically what they taught him\nA what he learned from the NASA mission when he made Star Wars he knew they were able to use miniatures either I mean who would've thought miniatures so advanced would give you the idea that you're looking at something like a death star it was it was just amazing\nWell that's very true yeah yeah and they they could possibly do it but you know and then another thing I I don't think our scientists now\nHave the engineering backgrounds is it pronounced it back then as well so that could be another thing might are not coming up with things you know if you think about it they're searching for life but\nThey're not looking for electromagnetic signatures you know you'd have to be a ... or ... well I have a magnetic signature you see what I mean\nYeah well I mean they they had this or they just they come out with all this stuff saying well we want you all do you know when you do your mission has got to have some sort of a plan to find alien life whatever you do from conceptualization to beyond\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the ... program so what are we going to now Olga putting to lay\nOut right yeah when I have to weigh out there that I I ...\nEither way I I think it will come out and the next few years whether that it or not it'll happen\nWhile I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I think they were going to go back on their idea that he went to the moon but\nThinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs don't kinds of other crazy stuff I mean what if he said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and we're trying to go to a ... go to the moon and uh you know would we give you a little bit of money\nYou know you make this a little space race a little more interesting and I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge it to a race that I Am compared to like the fat kid going up to the the ... guy saying hey I'm going to I'm going I'm going to run a race with you and I'm going to beat you\nAnd then in the ... and ... and the the guy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
