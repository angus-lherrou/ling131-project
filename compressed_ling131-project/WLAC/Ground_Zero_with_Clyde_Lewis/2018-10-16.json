one of the keys that we found on the ... really on the lifestyle sign\nThe diabetes type two is one of the most I Believe a health challenges that we have\nThat we can really overcome it mainly because your lifestyle is what put you in it there's some small genetic components to this very slight mostly lifestyle that's good news though so it's not like are pointing the finger\nWhen somebody gets in that it it's amazing how literally you can start\nGetting rid of the processed foods getting rid of the jump to sweep the candies to process carbohydrates the bread pasta cereal crackers

take your call or we can send us an email their website\nEither way will be glad to support your quote for the hour comes from Neil Armstrong one of the great mystery creates wonder and wonder is the basis of man's desire to understand about that email came in June in Dallas texas says I drink a lot of coffee\nBut it's the cat still as bad as caffeinated\nWell it comes down really when you talk about coffee and I'm I'm not anti coffee I'm really not\nThere's good benefits from coffee I mean there's it's got like a sixty five percent reduction in prostate cancer and it's got plenty of antioxidants in it that are really good for overall health but coffee also stimulates a lot of quarters all this is what is kind of a little bit on the negative side about\nIs it can stimulate quarters on the cortisone levels I mean ... all we all have its British by the adrenal it's a woman thing\nCourt us just to be elevated my morning that's what makes us up she's called her circadian rhythm it wakes up in the morning and snaps you out of bed\nAnd then you're good energy throughout the day supposed if you're healthy and then you kind of wind down as the day goes on then when it gets dark at night you should really start winding down that some cortisol levels\nBegin to decrease in record is all really decrease schools\nThat you know a good thing well what happens is people's system becomes clipped and cortisol level is actually elevated at night the slightest yep and they can't go to sleep and they\nWatch television down the computer or whatever and then in the morning they have hardly any cortisol production\nAnd that's one of the coffee comes in because the coffee bean itself stimulates quarters all and as you stimulate more quarters all production that's where that's where you wake up that's what you should stop the caffeine\nThat actually wakes you up it's literally the corners of production that so that's a couple of keys there that can really help you along the way because I mean at the end of the day decaf or not it's not the casting\nThat's the challenge it really becomes more of what it does your cortisone production so one cup of coffee keeps cortisone levels up about six or seven hours during the day\nAnd it can cause increased wrinkly skin aging in the skin\nYou can store more body fat now if you couple caffeine regular caffeine whether it's in green tea or whatever it's got a lot of fat burning mechanisms in it but a lot of times in the court has all his accelerated her increased that's where\nThe challenge really comes in when you start dealing with that\nThat's of course you know again where people kind of struggle with that because you know I mean it's one of those deals where not everybody in the you don't gain spare tire you don't want to deal with destroying brain cells in and muscle cells and all that\nAnd I'm not saying coffee directly done all that I'm just an elevated quarters on the body can do that over a long period of time and it can cause a white candidate for people to take steroids that can cause\nThe actions white game so I'm a bigger than coffee do it in moderation you know that kind of thing but think about green too because green who has caffeine you get a mental left\nBut it also has sixty five percent reduction in cancer as well by drinking it and it reduces cortisol in the body so because of that actually support not\nDoing it since ... mother out on the charts and want to thank our producer Jay Patrick engineer Jon garrison and the rest of the Disney ... one person suddenly you

here to tell you about my good friends at\nLiberty health share as a doctor I'm always looking for the best options for taking care of people's health and that's exactly what I found with liberty healthcare liberty hill shares not insurance it's a bold\nAnd lowering health costs\nHelping your fellow members in other words your monthly sharing contribution goes to help others needs how awesome is that personally I've been a member of liberty hill share for years\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state which is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I Divide that this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think\nWe need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreeing with the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this quarter and wants to take over to go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\n[noise] ... yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\n... ... ... you know so\nYou had a the Turks came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have in a in a price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong\nSo the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump has a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections\nAnd they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy\nAnd it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide beads stay manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWould this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wishing I were to look at\nThe un other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to Laurel could be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ... is a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory\nWe have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but you know watch him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey has said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh the glue them out of the country\nSlide if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason you said that he was in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can get in there and the embassy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey make the argument that the CIA was facilitating operation deep late ... argument that he said operatives lady I a whore facilitators to the murder of this uh uh of of cars Yogi\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian us a beep said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too but what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple\nOr our country even more can be give the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident does an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia\nAnd the thing that I have a feeling do need to do that well I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot\nYeah\n\n\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we train tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight of them [noise]\n\n\nI don't remember\nHow how how are you one thing I'm I'm Wondering how\nYou already are\n\nOh I like\nWatch [laughter] Les Paul highly\nI'm part of the government because that that was made everybody\nHaving a hell I found out they said if it has any group of people they don't even try to undermine down\nWhen there were no one has undermined out more than ...\nOver again\nWe\nI'm quite Louis\nYou're listening to ground zero and lot of people are saying and this is something interesting to see the writing me and telling me that we're supposed to be independent now of oil we produce more oil and Saudi Arabia well the question I have many as it were that were that\nSufficient why is gas so damn high right now I don't get it I mean we've we've seen it you know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even up to five fifty a gallon but now we're pushing four dollars a gallon\nAnd uh I I really think though that would have an effect probably not as much in fact this may be you know\nTen dollars at the pump by me but I always get into this fear that some somebody will wake up to ten dollars a pop because it's something we've done or something is happening\nYeah I don't know the the ... the world down anything is possible anything we speculate about the past is coming true it it's just weird how you know and ... how much division would happen if we found ourselves in a\nIn a in a moment of scarcity when I talk about ... weeks ago with ... and re Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must bore scarcity\nIn order to demonstrate what it would mean to\nRedistribute the wealth redistribute\nGoods and services in and and make everything uh a happy global family see this is what they're pushing for an outside interest\nAnd outside interested is not American Constitution republic not democracy it's something else they want and they they they need to make their dance and trauma that he's traumatized enough to be ready\nBecause they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty that's where they would say due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish\nAnd what they want to put forward a in that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United\nStates of America to go to George in Kentucky Hi George you're on ground zero\nHey I have a foot here so they're a little bit I think you're right about the state but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that day rallies way Trump passed to ignite public on both directions good and\nBad or we have and if we have George George leech or like the way the white light but no you know you need to acknowledge\nThe fact that there are other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be\nThe major but I think the next one coming up is it will be stabilized with this tape state airing involved in all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on the elections and we'll just carrying ... two weeks staple\nWhat country do you think it was so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you would think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that I did what we\nKnow it's not stupid if you think about\nIt well it did he would lay that\nMost you got most of the American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I give you your Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the story is between the neo Nazis planned everything that's going on I think about all the ... going on and what this is set up for an Emmy ... if you look at it in the respect no that's not going on it's not happening\nBut then you go okay well that can't happen but it is happening wicked all the diversity yeah I mean like that's happening with every bite out of the airport you got all these a fraction of the people that are just ... fit about everything in the country\nIf you look at things will be stabilized everywhere\nWe are being labeled by the time all the countries all the countries that ah you don't want to hold onto their sovereignty and their freedom or being destabilize it right the United states is a big ...
