disagree they bring their differences to light they vote the EU's constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries but\nMore than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries a little over now we've had disagreements in the past and that's something to this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his\nBalanced and ah\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with them and that's nonsense\n\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history meeting sixty one where we distrust of the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil war I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree\nIt's such a disagreement about how our system is run we have a ... we had a civil war there was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out\nThere were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a you know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now but I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict\nThat one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulp and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country when he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposing but none other than John McCain\n\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards of Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there were major coups in the planning for Truman and for\nFDR major coup of course planned and and and actually executed by a those in the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be infringed in national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution number two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\nNumber three\nThere will be sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate nation of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes now I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out and of course we have been\nAnalyzing in speculating about being state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst but this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow government has always been\nThe dark commanded it leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nWhile we're looking under rocks for falsify proof all we're having these disputes\nAnd the symptoms of war here in the United states be effected working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven\nWhich makes it even more suspicious especially when\n\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James\nAnd chief of naval operations John Richardson\nWere sent rice and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressman during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just were attacking officials but this isn't registering it\nTrump history and I said sometimes you don't know what you run into you have somebody step out and
