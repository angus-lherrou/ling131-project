[noise] it can also get well so members it's all about choices\nThat we make every single day the choices we make today\nCan and will determine the kind of health we're going to happen tomorrow I think that these things called smart contact lenses and of course they say now that you measure blood sugar levels in diabetics so Google is actually working on these smart contact lenses that would measure\nBlood sugar glucose levels and the tears of people with diabetes is successful the contacts would offer diabetics a painless\nAnd more convenient alternative having to protect themselves to get blood putting the test strips\nAnd they're an electronic reader that can collect the data the prototype contact lenses have miniscule wireless chips and the glucose sensors\nAre able to measure the sugar levels per second Eli daylights inside the windows were also flash\nWhen the sugar levels are too low know Google's conducted clinical research studies on the contact lenses and is in discussions with the U.S food and Drug Administration is saying now that this isn't the first attempt to develop such a device in two thousand eleven Microsoft team but the University of Washington to create contact lenses glucose sensors\nTo ... to to really be able to monitor these and make things a little bit easier for everyone along the way to go to Frank now on the line Frank\nOf fortune regarding a price daycare and I was wondering if you could try your permission for probably about that\nYet prostate is I mean obviously it's a growing concern for guys and the younger generation guys

... number one is eating an avocado in a regular basis now if you got BPA sure doctors get you on a round of antibiotics I mean obviously you want to stick to that\nIf you're wanting to figure out

that should be able to help you along the way AAA to eight three Seventy seven to muscle building exercises they're saying now can reduce women's diabetes so lifting weights\nAnd other muscle building workouts reduce women's risk of diabetes according to a new study the researchers analyzed data collected for nearly a hundred thousand US nurses over eight years and found that those that lifted weights and depressed ups or similar resistance workout\nWere less likely to develop type ... diabetes and this was from the b._b._c. news but compared with inactive women those who did at least a hundred and fifty minutes of aerobics activity\nAnd at least an hour of muscle strength training a week or a third less likely to develop diabetes and it was already known that regular aerobics workout can help prevent type ... diabetes in previous studies have shown that muscle building exercises protect men against the diabetes as well so weight training as a whole\nHas been known to be quite helpful its support I mean I'm just a big big fan type two diabetes with our obesity rate in America specifically and people being overweight has just sky rocketed and I'm just sick of it I'm just sick of seeing people\nGetting sick and I'm just ... it just gets old like there were getting bigger fatter\nPeople are just getting sick and they don't feel good it's time to make you change the other thing is I can tell you what to do you you have to do it yourself with diabetes I'm telling you exercising and doing some type of of resistance exercise I don't care if it's the bans you want to get an exercise video something\nReally helps the body if if you the more muscle mass you can increase\nThe better you can stabilize your blood sugar levels in the body and of course that comes with not only just exercising but eating well you have to make sure you eat the right kind of foods on a regular basis\nSo eating habits really do matter and making sure that we get the right kind of foods and on a regular basis you know equal amounts of lean protein sources like chicken fish beef or ... low glycemic carbohydrates in the former fruits and vegetables and that are healthy fats\nThey're all means you're walnut your cash draw because\nEating these kinds of foods at a regular basis only is going to help your overall system as far as living the kind of life and the freedom you deserve living the kind of health\nThat you need if you don't have to be ... you are you can really come out of that email came in Wendy in Buffalo New York says that over the last year I've been walking in eating healthy and I want to start working out with weights but never had before what's a good way to get started\nWell and the weight training I like to get a trainer I think most people should get one even if it's just for the first months even if you just go meet with him once or twice a week because if you don't have a good knowledge of free weights and the machines and all that they can really help guide you teach you some basic routines\nModify your routines and get you to hit the goals and the results that you're looking for\nAnd that's really the ultimate key it's it's to get your body in a situation where it's balanced and making sure that you get to foods that you need of course someone like a nutritionist or lifestyle coach can help you with that but\nThe exercise I think it's really important to have someone guide you say you have just form you don't get hurt\nAnd you learn the differences with the the temp bows and in and how fast you need to work out how slow you need to rest and and all that sort of thing because all of that matters and getting results there's such a science\nTo exercise fitness and weight training I mean it is very very detailed and the more you can have someone walk with you and that\nThe better results you're gonna get and then you can do it on your own and you'll be fine but you see the coach in the big and the beginning of it but it's another hour the charts and when I think our producer Jay ... engineer Jon garrison and the rest of the team go tell one person something you learned on this show and together\nWe change the health of

Sweden\n[noise]\nManning sweet and said that the sound filled the entire sky it lasted for about an hour he says he's like something went from one end of the sky to the other end and uh\nSo could this be extraterrestrial aircraft could this be test aircraft could this be something that could be sent from space like a signal\nThese these real cosmic XO cosmic does signals coming through there are a lot of things to think about it especially when they're discovering some of these particles that don't exist there they go against the standard model and that's what blows me away let's go to her when in Tennessee I crew and your ground zero\n[laughter] Hi Hi I'm\nA ... I found this topic very interesting and uh um so I did a little research on the train goes because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the sun\nRight during my research I found out they were getting neutrino from a number of sources of boys saw large metallic cloud of ... and\nAnd the supernova Nineteen eighty seven eight ... and and uh it in the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried\nSo very very deep in the ground and they have to be extremely large what worked what\nCame to my attention is this has been an Arctic oh where are you know at the polls a media writes in in ... they're all they're they're found very easily in ... and it's common place to find things just fall whose faith\nIn in that and touch reach into our planet right um so you know it came to him are a lot of tension let what if they would be holding this neutrino detector system has to be so deep in the ground so large\nThat they ran across something they found something that maybe shouldn't have been ... you know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nSee that's the way you know in my ... from whatever they may have filed\nBuilding list detectors and the question is you know\nWhat is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera see right not son particles\nCars aren't new apart these aren't these are not neutrinos for the sun these are not neutrinos from\nPerhaps the quasars something else these are neutrinos from a what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or do you think it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is somebody that doesn't belong on this planet is being a ... for the Antarctic ... into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular throughout point and it works fine leader detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the poll you know they're ... that's\nThat's a bit odd out to make our magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of beef up the comic particle right and ... and you know\nIt it is really concerns me 'cause well you know ... ... ... detectors have to be very deep underground in filled with water\nAnd in in order to you know could detect neutrinos that large numbers of it has to bounce off a particle right ... ... a heavy water molecule right and what we need it said he'd be water molecule it creates a splash that fit the detector to protect\nAnd that's how they detected neutrinos now while they're building this incredibly large apparatus this you know this has been\nUsed to train our detectors are not quite ... not quite as widely known as the uh had drunk a collider right at least those things are models twenty miles law in in ... that leads to take these three oh detectors fear\nNot quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of at\nWork and she wouldn't nature and\nWhen they're taking down into this ice is not faint disturbed\nOr hundreds of thousands of years I mean I'm like they look they found a thing literally yeah like the movie\nYes the move around a thing as they did\nAnd and they could open a planet up to something we're not ready to have\n... and that's why they had to bring down a Russian Orthodox a patriarch president assuming they're turning in state but all the all these our all all of these\nUh um public figures in in the politicians in and scientists to before what time you know it it it's scary\nCome really come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the creature that lives on practically nothing lives on the air and sunshine doesn't live on any food lives in harsh conditions\nAnd look what he's putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a single back and this is why we're so concerned about tech technical signatures SETI\nThey could just see the microorganisms whatever they found charity you know we carry microorganism bacteria\nIn our bodies are foreigners just ... just for us to survive you know we have good bombing bad right now what ... wherever they found that lady there and it may be very first to our biological system\nSo they're keeping contained there obviously but they they they're they're certainly concerned\nAbout the signatures it's giving off there certainly concerned about what we're hearing what we're watching this the the fast radio burst the ... the the rumble in the horn sounds in the air they're concerned about these things because they just don't know how to identify it they can I Do\nNot coincidence no it's not going since ... are just going out and said oh something's\nBeen found in Antarctica something it was a are actually sending a signal out from space I Believe was the more they traced the signals to an article that neutrino signals were also trace\nThis is definitely communication and they won't tell us it's communication until they most certainly habit pinpointed as to how the communication was set and what was done and what the what the result will be [noise]\nAny in this day and age that can't hide anything no can't hide anything from the public I mean we're going to find out we are going to say I hope I hope we don't find out too late before we can do anything about it\nYeah it's amazing time 'cause Oh thank you for your expertise thinking for calling to program you see it's a it's it's definitely something that I'm sure\nThe president or those who want disclosure and all this never thought this is getting going to be happening the way it is a lot of people who are like you know talking about you know other things going on an article that may have nothing to do with this but it certainly is interesting how this is all coming together [noise] I don't think anybody is mentioning\nHow important it is to notice that things coming out of there do not do not fit and they do not fit the model the standard model that science has breaking all the rules of physics right now oh\nVery very interesting time to
