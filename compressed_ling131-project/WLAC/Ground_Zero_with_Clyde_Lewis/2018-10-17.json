Spanish civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War a ... a ... a lot of Mexican starting to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to uh to uh to probably didn't marijuana along with alcohol and we really complained about marijuana nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up and they created in the ... campaign around reefer madness I smoked pot you go crazy and there's\nA funny movie now wasn't funny on called re from ... to talk about all set up\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana act act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nTax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana and they put a tax on marijuana and that didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may ...\nOn illegal and it's been illegal ever said but the fact of the matter is is that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created the police the police state around are around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana\nOr psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we know that marijuana clause I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and I was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with a lot it every day the the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you tried something\nAnd I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I says I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's\nAnd so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away\nAnd it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea and I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints\nAnd ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a ... a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country as such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world\nThey they treat or this type of a crisis not with jail time in and punishment\nThey they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and a and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better\nOr a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help\nAnd they're in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments and I think that the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or\nUh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have them is not going as criminals and be trained to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under\nMedical arrest that would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because\nThe problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said in the beginning but it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain\nBut it's felt physically but it's pain that is felt on a on a I guess you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain or wracked with pain\nExplained al ... they'll work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it now I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people\nWho say that they like things like tram at all and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over it or or biking than or Percocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as thorough set and most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be ally basically\nYou know what I mean one of the scariest things one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you that this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery\nAnd uh I was given a a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're\nAnd this is my got here it's been caught you know you can't move because you know your core has been cut and you can't move and it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced\nAnd that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication\nOr to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times feeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of\nOf calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill\nThat's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe have an addiction to the smell\nTest your body down regulate its own natural production so all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out of balance what's really interesting to me why and how much of the stuff that we talk about it affects the central pain for example could be related to things like inflammation inside the body\nFrom too much sugar Yeah Yup or outwardly show this agency maybe we're not getting enough I think we know we take zinc out of the diet completely one of the things that happened to get anxious you get to pry but maybe there's people are suffering from\nFrom the efficiency never teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your diet side of inflammation is going to go away just like that you lose weight you're gonna feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nBut we live in an empire quiet where the empire depends on on eating sugar and eating grains and eating fast food and eating and eating and eating so they are well\nCan be created yeah we\nAgain it comes right back down to understanding our bodies are standing by chemistry and this is what I dedicated my life to helping people understand how their bodies work at a biochemical weapons or biochemical level at all [noise]\nAnd that's when we need to be educating our style right in Asia the Internet ... living it should be much easier any way\nTo educate ourselves into how exactly our bodies were amazed me\nHow ... how much non understanding we have as individuals and the culture and even our authority how much not understanding our health authorities hat\nHow the buys put together and how the body and how the body work did you you talked to
