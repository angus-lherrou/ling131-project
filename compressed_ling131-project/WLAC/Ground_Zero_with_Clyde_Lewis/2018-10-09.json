network dot com what about our kids today we all think that maybe kids grow up too fast always talk about that when they're when they're little but they're finding now than in some ways a trend tends to be that us teenagers are maturing\nA lot slower than in past generations so high school kids today are less likely to be drinking or having\nSex they say versus their counterparts in the eighties
