C. when there's low vitamin D the calcium really doesn't have any regulator and\nThe vitamin D is kind of the regulator of it and it makes a big difference so if you don't have enough\nThen that's where you get into trouble but for the future keeping your vitamin D levels up is going to be a big key and you know that now so that's fine so it's just about coming up with a new game plan that's that's what I did get a blood test done and then from this point on it do you ever get podiatrist you been working with\nNo not really I I I just like an actual remedy I buy them and they would that fit the last time I had a check which it probably wasn't too bad\nThat's not too bad seven day now and he's a better place to keep it [noise] yeah\n... yeah there and you ended up on the high end of the range yeah do you eat a lot of counseling based foods all\nNight it's very good my profession but it's vegetables I'm very very little there you go well and if anything okay for a\nLot of green vegetables yeah lots of green vegetables\nYes you're getting a ton of calcium so it's a it's about it's just a mountain and vitamin D if he's not bad don't get me wrong but when you're dealing with some kind of nagging little issue like bunnies you want to be bringing up to that next level\nAnd getting those numbers up between about Seventy in Ninety is really taking it to the next level so that's when I was looking to just a couple of things I mean they're not going to go away overnight and that's why I Would go meet with a podiatrist you just get their opinion and they want to do it naturally but still just just hear their thoughts I Would at least go have\nA a console and here they have to say and then go from there that's that's what I Would do personally right triple eight to eight three seven to seven two lines are open with questions about your health let's go to Barbara Hi Barbara\n...\nAnd whining it anything thinking I\nHave the doctors told her that's the only option or I guess they have well here's the thing or the\nThe big issue in this where they are to the nurses is many times it's about the only option and you can support the heart you can support the heart health\nUh but at the end of the day you know you want to make sure that\nI don't know from what I've seen let me just say this from what I've seen surgeries about the only way in that now you can support the heartbeat vitamins omega three fads and healthy diet but with ... with the orders to notice is really in once one other thing I have seen and I I've actually read a lot on\nAnd have seen even implemented in some more natural alternative practices is increasing the high amounts of written in the body can do that from food based sources or supplemental force a sources I'll talk to your health for folks to sit with them in stock and in in that kind of thing but that can be helpful\nTo be vitamins are very important when you get deficient in those you'll see a lot of that with the orders to messages but at the end of the day you want to go to ... I Would not discount\nThe potential for surgery on that I Would you know and I'll tell you I'll shoot you straight and and always tell you kind of my thoughts on that but again I see a lot of great success with the surgery so I wouldn't be too worried about it as long as you're in the hands of a of a good physician you know I\nMean you're comfortable with him I wouldn't worry too much about it [noise]\nJust because there's there's a lot of\nThere's a lot of people that really get good results and I just [noise]\nAre not only that but the uh the budget to protect us from asteroids went from sixty million dollars to a hundred and fifty million dollars overnight\nTo something certainly is going on out there something that they don't want to tell us about but certainly this is a an amazing time to be monitoring what's going out on your ... what's going on out in space to go to Greg in Texas it's good Greg Hi Greg you're on ground zero\nI act and then I had a lab got from all that I have a little\nScary for you now based on what you're saying now and I tried that or I or all of a you know we love wearing ... saw the same time there was painters\nWere what here's what about the years\nLast shares a like a global a round objects\nOh years three years there were around ... yeah okay\nUh-huh they were about a quarter mile a wide clubs and that's what I saw in ... Iraq of that and she can get yourself a professional remote zero 'cause I was just an average Joe\n... is a professor or a lot of errors or to work with your head of the staff at all and get ... a ... a ... there's a major advantage that\nWell I mean it'd be great if we could like second guess the moon or second guess what's going on in the sky you say you saw this in your remote viewing if there is a remote you're out there that could remote view what's going on in the ... it's a a professional I wouldn't mind you call them down and try and get out but Greg I thank you for recommending that I'd be glad\nYeah at ... ... when I got a suggestion is ... there was a T. V. O. T. V. show cause space not to not any of that you know I remember the first day at ... or ... or the cat is a huge blast\nYeah it was a nuclear explosion on the moon uh-huh\nRight well as you called it was a sort of ... ... ... check this out and keep an eye out for a ... or that way Kate ... such as yet\nSo I don't think that it happened as a mom said it was impossible but we do know the moon is pulling away from the planet is doing on the short\nIt's kind of doing it a bit by bit little by little\nIf you go to Nick in Texas Hi Nick you're on ground zero\nI don't know but I'm doing fine how are you\nNot as bad a call in a sort of soft activities and I don't just make us see I'll tell you how to ... that\nThere are\n... ... s activity or else they call ... ... oh see\nYeah we know about it like streaming frequently the as huh\nYet just like your shoulders so if you go to a more than ... people complaining\nAbout one getting ill left center them\nE. L. S. it's getting to make people comment cry\nWell we're not talking about that right now we're talking about what's happening out in space it's not about E L I can I go to mark in Colorado Hi Mark you're on ground zero\n... thanks for taking my call that a lot of sound bite kinda sounded to me like an old dial up modem modem trying to communicate\nWell it wasn't a dial up modem it was a it was the the sensors that are picking up where they say is a rattle under a under Antarctica and that's what they are picking up it's rattled but some are arguing that what it is the wind blowing across the snow or the ice and that's why we're getting that sound and others are saying it may be from something else completely because\nThey've been receiving these neutrinos signals and they didn't know what they are so something is active in Antarctica something is active in space right now they're shutting down the telescopes and there and they and they are they shut down YouTube for temporary period of time because something they didn't want us to see went on in space last night was going on right now in space\nRight but uh but I've ... I don't think it was a mother or my or something else other than that and the train those uh that's like a radio reporter so to me\nI was just bizarre I think it's bizarre that the that's the sound uh that uh they picked up on and and while it's in the science journals still you know geoscience journal saying well this is what we think is some seismic waves were picking up on others are saying well this is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or\nSending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in the coincidental ... has been going on in the past three days\nWhere I'd like to know is the single going into that coming out it's the same and the strengths\nDo anybody anybody can take the signal and they can speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the signal because I used to have a guy who he would hear signals he'd say well let me speed it up and see what I get it needs to be to have all this like rpm and you'd get all these weird sounding side band voices going on\nSo or the you know whatever they said that could be I get really even slowed down side band or a sped upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure they're saying it could be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust to create this type of\nAh the sound uh it does sound very much like something out of preventing planet and sounds like something to be from an old Nineteen fifty science fiction film and uh once again I played it and I get I'm getting worried that when I play that I got some jamming going on so I don't know if they're trying to block me from playing this\nI mean what's going on and kind of reluctant to play it again but maybe if I get enough demand I'll play it again so people can hear it\nWas a one quick question and uh every earlier saying more about that you sort of the sun\nThe structure in front of the sun\nI thought that might have something to do with all this\nIt it's one of those things that we get out into the the ... that's for sure that something you know that they were looking into it sunspot\nCertainly connected to this we we we never know though I mean sunspots shut down and then all the telescope shutdown we have the rover shutting down on Mars and then we have\nYouTube shutting down so he's telling me the Amazon shut down and I don't know what that's about it but maybe maybe something else is going on maybe this is some sort of a test baby I don't I don't know but it just seems a little weird a little awkward\nThrough talking about a possible alien invasion some people are feeling like this is how many of the invasion would begin that you know we we campus so he was rocket going up and sent it back down and get away you can't go into space the ins asked is a band and\nAh you know all these things are happening and no one's giving an explanation as to why except the budgets going in to protect the planet from extraterrestrial attack had just increased Ninety million dollars which is also something to pay attention to\nIt you know it doesn't sound like the winter may but\nThat doesn't sound like when to me either I agree with you mark thank you so much for the call I agree it doesn't sound\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\nHe is the

something that is bizarre Antarctica released some interesting sounds coming from a size ... sensors\nWas released today and they're saying well they're arguing over whether or not its seismic waves being picked up the sound of the eyes shifting when the winds headed or maybe something entirely something alien\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nGo to Margie in Michigan Hi Margie and ground zero\n... my my
