her name has alligator exactly\nExactly okay told me once I got a fulltime job because I was like a flaw or restaurant jobs that were like hey Lenny that actually passed over the payment Philly and I said okay without getting myself into help\nPayments are included and paying payments Oh nice okay\nRight or the story sucks [laughter]\nSo I'm now a few years later a or at slash ear see I got my job and she gave me the payments and I realize that even though I don't have started off\nIn the corporate world I don't make enough to to pay for the car so my story kind of like a lady that called the NFL I Know you're guideline that I'd have to get rid of the car but I don't know how to go about doing that that I get my leg you know it's not our off though thick yeah and it also fix so\nShe mentally ill and they don't act like is she mentally unable to make legal decisions\nNo she's not mentally eight she's mentally able she has a virus that if the credit so that's why he was able to get the car in the pain that she did\nSo here's the thing she tried to do a nice thing for you and she did it in a really stupid way and so now you're both stuck\nRight because you ... shows more\nIt's not gonna hurt your credit at all your credit is not involved it's her credit that we're worried about we want to do a nice thing for her 'cause she's sick and not able to deal with this so uh what she probably knows more on this car than it is worth I'm guessing\nIf they care for it at our adding Kelley Blue book steady was a word around a close to twenty thousand at that and they found out\nIt's worth close to twenty thousand would have voted against it\nI Want to throw like ... like twenty thousand now okay or does your ... to have any money\nShe retired but not really only she couldn't afford it okay All right well\nUm she you guys are in a pinch us is very uncomfortable because there's what needs to happen she needs to sell this car because her niece can't pay the payments and when she sells the car she's going to lose seven thousand dollars on it what are we going to do with that\n\nDo you feel obligated to pay that\nYou're not legally are way I don't think I mean I Know what I Do get accepted it I Know yeah\nYeah how old are you how to try it what do you make a choice without\nJeeze [noise] okay well someone's going to find the seven thousand dollars to put with the twenty thousand dollars that you get from your the she gets from her by her to pay the car off so that the buyer can get the title and that's going to leave you and her\n... her seven thousand dollars in the whole if you want to help with that you can um where I'm mediating this I Would say you both did something stupid I Would ask you to split it\n... that she each thirty five hundred and you eat thirty five hundred and let's get the car so if she's too sick to handle the transaction have her sign of power of attorney over to you for the this title\nAnd then you get the car sold and um I have her come up with three thousand five hundred and you go borrow three thousand five hundred and that's your penalty for being engaged in this in her penalty for being engaged in this because the other option as you stop paying the payments and she gets ... D\nWe doesn't sound really scared of the credit yeah that does that doesn't sound like a good plan to make because she's going to end the\nSick old lady's gonna get sued\nTrying to do something nice but she did it in the stupid way [noise] so I think you both split this or that she was the fairness thing it's not a legal thing [noise]\nBut it's what I call stupid to actually do something stupid

with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking to you for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college money from my one year old mhm I'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for about\nA thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I put Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it\nAnd then everything above that and that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different being there in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and in what you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nUh any extra money I come in to throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payments so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house and then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find in my budget almost keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you guys are\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it currently with the U.S department of treasury\nUm it as a result of having been additional service academy or three years ago um and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue paying off the smallest at first or should I\nI'm just a start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know the fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount of all I'm\nYeah I'm In what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile so you learn you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on line three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can cause you got wonderful income you'll be dead for\nTwo years it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start going thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go way really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either after the surge through in the service or you're assigned to\nThe recruitment and death and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nStray dog on life and the money this is the day Ramsey show on news radio listening thin W. L. A. C.

[laughter] yeah but it can happen it can I address\nOn what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you\nKnow of of her checking account because\nAnd what is it out at the website or do we need to go someplace else for that\nFrank Franklin theater okay yeah\nClinton theater [noise] they are they going to court oh well\nWell you're a little bit static either we last year but uh I'm gonna see this and I'm going to do the best I can ... I Try not to embarrass you and I'm In an embarrassed that the the um my producer John who who every time I go out I represent him\nAnd [laughter] ...

listen I'm real quick or or you get the good night sleep if you're not\nA let me let me give you a least one path that you could do that because I worked for me\nMy pillow dot com I'm not kidding and guess what the promo code caregiver caregiver is to promote\nFrom my pillow dot com or just the most creative I I mean I just say and I just said you get they get four pack with to travel pillows now why is it important because guess where caregivers traveled to\nTo the emergency room [laughter] to the fairly critical care waiting room ... board where there's a kid with the blues yeah there's and you and and you can wash these pillows you could put them in the drier\nThey are that you could get all the ... off of ... wherever you take them to if you're sitting there I mean I've had to sleep in in your rooms in in in family waiting rooms and so forth I've had to do all that and\nYou know you just feel you just feel funky and [laughter] you you know you want to live that long how long [laughter] I Am from South Carolina and I can't say foggy\nAnd and you just you just want to have these are great pills you just open the washer in and they they keep their shape made in usa Michael until you've seen those commercials\nThey will let caregivers have fifty percent off on this my pillow dot com so help me understand why you're not doing it because we ... need a good night's rest okay we just do ... ... ... little things like that can make a difference for us\nAs caregivers just getting a good night's rest and and and so that's that's what this show is all about herself to find those little things because it's not going to be the one big thing\nOkay 'cause we can't solve the problem anybody tells you that they can well they're going to lie about other things too\nWell I mean if you look down there walking on water you might want to listen well yeah that's\nYeah and and and that by the way that's a that's another thing\nI Do a lot of caregivers John who struggle with trying to manage everything that's one of the the land mines in my my book seven caregiver land mines is thinking that it's all up to you [noise]\nHere's a little test to find out if it is or not\nLook down at your hands [noise] do you see nail prince [noise]\nWell [noise] okay then it's not all up to you than is the St years to fix see the Gulf for us as caregivers is not to try to fix everything but it's to live peacefully with it [noise] to get a good night's rest to take care of herself physically emotionally fiscally [noise]\nProfessionally spiritually all of the above that's what we're doing on the show that's why we're so glad you're with is eight hundred six eight eight Ninety five twenty two we'll be right back this is hope for the caregiver [noise] we're so glad you with us we'll be right back\nTo\nA degree\nTo the show for a few are givers about hosted by giving you may be right that may be crazy [noise] hey\nBut it just might be a little bit sick you're looking for well look you guys can't see this unless you're on the Facebook Live thing but beer was ah was let thinking the math out of that song are so I I Do like to be some piano man\nVillage oh well All right he is he is one of the ... he is hoping the caregiver we're so glad you're with us you know in that well that's one of the things we've tried to do is have a little bit lighter show we were not here to to provide this at this place of of group ... we're not equipped to to wall oh\nYeah I I've done that on a done that been there done that got the T shirt and the therapy and it just no I'd walk into a you know diagnoses and [laughter] and shock treatment or you know I just I'm just not there I Am\nI'm more interested in strengthening each other's strengths in myself for this journey you know healthy caregivers make better caregivers I mean that's just that's the bottom line I think a wife and caregivers make pretty good character well as long as we're not laughing at of just you know a little bit of [laughter] you know but we we try to have a lot of fun here and and let people know that you don't want you can have\nA more joyful life on doing this now let me recap a little bit of what we're dealing with earlier [noise]\nOr caregiver tip of the day or was to limit access\nIf you were being gang up on\nBy people in in that will happen it'll happen when you least expect it will happen with church members it'll happen with family members will happen to work it'll happen and people will come out of the woodwork to give you all kinds of advice or criticisms about what you're doing or not doing\nAnd if that's the case that you just feeling gang up on limit access deal with these people on your terms not on their\n... if not cut off access to limit the limit yes you're not isolate yourself but you are going to protect yourself and I go back to what I saw it martial arts just stay at my ah we have a monthly black belt meeting and this is my instructor\nA critic who is just wonderful and he came in to the room where we were training there that was part of the exercise and into big room there there was three guys that were waiting and there was going to start trying to spar with attacking\nAnd he immediately disabled voter that that literally but he he could he and and then he backed up\nBack into the doorway so they could not Russia one time they had to come single file so he's going to deal with them on his term's not on there and he did that kind of instinctively unimpressed everybody a was with what he did and so\nLimit access to your heart limit access to your your emotional wellbeing your physical wellbeing from people who are maybe speak maybe they have good intentions maybe they do let's give them the benefit of the doubt but that doesn't mean that they're having good results\nIn by coming up and trying to to parachute into your life until you as a caregiver hey you're doing it wrong or you get this or you get this ... you know no they're not doing it they're not ... they're not doing what you do they go home to their place of safety or whatever I I've been a caregiver for thirty two years\nThat those you've been listening to show and and watching the show on Facebook Live and YouTube and so forth how many times have you heard me come in beat up my fellow caregivers and tell them what they should be doing or whatever I mean I still do it\nSo if I'm not doing it to you and I've got thirty two years of experience\nWhy don't you let these other people do it too I mean really I mean I think it through why do you live in that habit you don't need to\nAnd and that's what I'm hoping I can do to the show was to infuse you with the vocabulary and the understanding of what it looks like to protect yourself self defense is what the show is all about you don't value I mean you don't understand what you don't value so we'll just start by helping you value who you are\nSo we're still nothing on fire were ways away from having to worry about their so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at that job and find out you had that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in my ear might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you've been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through is you feel the tyranny\nThe tyrant in your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly\nAnd out of almost ... out of almost a desperation an emotional desperation I my wrong or am I reading your mail\nHere correct okay and so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate\nBecause you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing and flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff and I actually know how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and ...\nGood and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't like that yeah that's probably about twenty three thousand kinds\nThat is not bankrupt up All right okay and do you have any IRS that\nYou know just for clarity on the house\nOkay and what type of a home loan did you have F ha VA or conventional\nUm do we wait for it started off fresh shutting may but then it got I'm told in finance and I'm at this point I don't even remember what kind of why\nIt's possible that they're not going to chase you at all\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have you fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars and the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to you and your wages and you just begin to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy\nTo see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again\nRight starts at all new but if you can just clear these things up they drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by garnishment\nBut to day I Would not file based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight you're going to be okay\nIf I Am able to start paying off but that we will be back he co founded smallish that are just\n... I Would love to swim smallest the largest and I would call the smallest one in subtle with them\nFor ten to twenty cents on the dollar and then I Would set of what the next one for ten to twenty cents on the dollar ... meanwhile I'd get my student loans going on a basic payment plan that's all after you're back to work and feeding your kids and have lights and water and used to live and all that which is infinitely more important than anything we're talking about\nRight\nNow have you been through financial ... virtually learning how to handle money\nI read said her own money make over a librarian but how how did they go through the glass is my guest I'm going to pay for it\nWhen you're facing and\nAnd You're welcome to the\nSomething about where you are them\nThis was the day Ramsey show\nAround here we go both ways ... am yeah we are doing both this is talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W well lazy and\nWhy should I get asked all the time is do I need life
