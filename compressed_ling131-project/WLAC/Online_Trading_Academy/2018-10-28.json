L. A. the this is the Tennessee tax busters and we are granted retirement intact advisory [noise]\nTalk radio Fifteen ... the this is the tendency tax busters and we are granted retirement and tax advisory welcome back to the show thanks for staying to through the commercial break we got some interesting information coming up for you but before we dive into it before we start talking about the\nDownfall and your IRAs and your four oh one case that most people are not thinking about a clip also brought up an interesting point over the break is that there's also somebody out there keeping a very close eye on your IRAs and four one K. is that most people are not aware of and we're going to talk about that\nAnd we're also going to talk about solutions to have more control over your IRAs and for one case then you may or may not be aware that you have now\nBut I don't like important stuff has [laughter] sounds like an ... it is only important stuff on this Saturday morning but I guess some caffeine Jimmy ... feel better [laughter] or you do he he will get a better job will per year there you go like the coffee okay the cliff and I were talking over the\nBreak we were talking about the types of people that we see on a daily basis and that it's interesting because a lot of times that the individuals who do come and meet with us or our tax professionals are our state planners I'm here at Grand retirement tax advisory\nThey show up at an educational event ahah yeah you know\nThey typically fall into a couple of different category to you know we we do we see a lot of people still that\nUm have done exactly what they've learned to do growing up and they put a little bit of their paycheck every single paycheck a little bit goes in their four O. one K. ah or there for three be depending on where they work and um they just let that money grow during their career and then they get closer to retirement and then all of a sudden it dawns on them\nOh wait a second now I've got to take this nest egg that I saved and I somehow have to make it last at least as long as I Do\nIs right message they that's usually what somebody reads a seminar they'll say individual retirement arrangement arrangement yeah it does kind of sound a little slippery ... a little bit\nBut here's here's the slippery part Jimmy that was very astute it is very slippery so the slippery part is this is that\nHave you ever thought about why you can't and a spouse or another person as an owner on your IRA or your four one K. like you could a joint bright investment count as some people some people don't even realize that but you can't you cannot you cannot because you already have a joint\nOr interest in your account in his name as Uncle Sam there you go and here's why\nYou have an arrangement you don't have a joined the ... you have an arrangement with Uncle Sam has right and the arrangement is basically this Uncle Sam came to us in the seventies and eighties and said hey if you will differ this money we're going to do a couple of things for you when to let it grow tax free until you need it and we're not going to tax you on the money you put into it until you take that back out\nAnd we're going to let it grow ever more and more like that's awesome Uncle Sam we like the plan and and it does have a role I mean we're not saying this isn't about this is a bad thing\nBut it does have its role but then what if in the seventies and eighties we adult hey Uncle Sam\nHow much taxes are we going to oh when we take it out what would have told us Andrew well let's just figure it out when we get their ups right we'll figure it out later so the point is we don't know how much of that so when Andrew said earlier there's somebody else keeping an eye on your account but maybe you're not aware of\nThe truth is you don't know how much of that money is yours and you don't know how much of it is Michael Sam's and you won't know until it's time to start taking it out so cliff\nOf I asked you right now if you wanted an open an account with me but then I got to choose how much of it was mine year to year would you do that let me think about it and after the break I'll give you my answer to hire a blank check that's just made me a blank jak we'll be right back at least they do and we've got more than a great information coming up this is talk radio Fifteen ten W. L. A. the\nWe're the Tennessee tax busters brought to you by granting retirement and tax advisory\n[noise]\nRadio Fifteen ... feet at the end of the ... and we are granted retirement in ... welcome back to the shows they things for a stand tune\nBefore we left for the break we were talking about I raised ... and a big sneaky underhanded\nDownfall and maybe not underhanded [laughter] for us to be a question I suppose I did but I got to set that I got it for everybody just in case they are just joining us so\nWe're talking about IRAs and ... and how a IRA we've been widely told that stands for an individual retirement account but if you look up the publication five Ninety on the IRS website you will find that Uncle Sam calls it an individual retirement arrangement\nAnd the reason behind that is because your IRA your four one\nK. your tax deferred retirement accounts or a joined account with Uncle Sam\nSo every time Congress started talking about taxes you need to look at your TV and say I have an arrangement with those guys right\nYou do and and the scary thing is the the uh\nThe downfall that we see is that who gets to change\nTheir ratios of how much money in that four one K. your IRA is yours and how much is the government's with a government that's right and so when push comes to shove and the IRS in the in our government says you know what we can no longer pay our national debt bill\nWith the tax revenue that's being created we have to raise taxes what\nDoes that mean for your tax deferred accounts that means that Uncle Sam is going to come in and say All right\nMore of your account as mine now when you take this withdraw I'm going to keep more of it because I'm going to raise taxes or I'm going to do away with deductions or I'm going to get rid of exemptions and we're gonna talk a little bit about that cliff came up with a a really interesting concept that I Want to get to about a\nFew didn't ask me my ... you know maybe they don't worry don't worry we're going to just stay tuned we're going to talk about uh the government taking benefits away or what they really do to kind of skirt that issue\nBecause they don't they don't scoop in LA I'm taking a hundred thousand dollars a year IRA\nAs they don't do that well anyway cliff I Know you want to answer this question so can I ask cliff before we left after the break if if we could open a joined account together an investment account together and if I could change the rules year to year on how much of that account was mine and how much was his and if you would do that or not what the answer\nAs much as I respected in Meyer and care about you know I thought about this deeply and the answer is no\nI'm Glad you put some thought into it I really tell you wait the opposite there you go well I've had a little caffeine now this morning and my brain is thinking clearly you know but that sounds ridiculous right that sounds ridiculous to somebody sat across the table for me and said hey let's open an account together but I get to change how much of that account is mind than yours your ear and nobody would do that\nBut that's what our ... and our IRAs and our tax deferred accounts are exactly right but there's a way around it and there's a way to protect yourself from it and there's a way to put yourself in control instead of letting Uncle Sam have all the control\nThey will not happen on its own and you need to work with a team like ours if not ours like are somebody who has the tax professionals the financial professionals and the legal profession\nOr this or yeah there's a legacy issued definitely yes I Am\nAbsolutely all under one roof so that you know you're getting the best information from all the sources on the spot and that these individuals are working together for your benefit\nBecause how many times have we have people come in who say well I was told X Y and Z and the non back to X Y and Z but I was all this this is so about my retirement account and so I I took these actions and we're like\nThat hurt you yeah and there's no way that you can undo it yeah war there's whether you're going to do it but it's going to be hard yeah\nSo you don't want that to be your case so when you're making these big decisions make sure that you're getting a second opinion talk to multiple groups find out who you click with and who makes you feel at ease and who you think is going to bring the best information for your scenario to you and I've heard you ask\nPeople are are you comfortable enough with your president plan are you comfortable enough with your president advisor to get a second opinion there and if you are in great let's talk and if you're not then that ...\nAbsolutely I Would beg my girl friends to bring in their mothers sleeping pill please bring in your father's racers we can do this secretly no one will ever know that you know me and my life because remember I'm a quadriplegic I Can't handle these thing I Need help\nTo in my life and yet these wonderful people God Bless them refused to listen to my to varying requests\nBut they spoke words of hope into my life and they said to me John it you may not be able to do quadriplegic you may not even be able to do chronic pain but you can do all things to Jesus Christ\nWho can strengthen you will you turn to him will you trust him and that and they want him to allow you persevere and into your and Peter I'm just so glad I'm living\nOh my goodness I I just turned sixty nine years old fifty one years and it's wheelchair and I celebrate life and I noticed that

states which allow people like me the guy with technology without a drug abuse of sorts or or or anything that is a\nIs an tied light that we already have\nGood laws which enabled people like me to plan um our our future and how we want to be treated and what we might like to uh have for treatment and what ... what we might not want to have for treatment we can make choices so let's not to share of the future\nAs ... said a moment ago let's have hope\nWell those are beautiful words and I think that's the message that we all would like to hear is available to anybody in Seventeen year old

a time you know one of the best things and it's not so ... it's not real spiritual but that I was told you know by my ... I Know is that this is\nThis is a blip on the radar screen of life okay so let's not get caught up in this right now because there will be a respite now whether that's just a little bit less painful\nYou can make it to the next thirty minutes or an hour or the day whatever that is but there is hope there is hope I love\nYour\nShow for ... and Peter Rosenberg and bring you three decades\nOf experience to help you stay strong and healthy as you take care of someone who is not\nAnd we're glad you're with this eight hundred six eight eight Ninety five twenty two I'm going to put that interview with Johnny and with gray Seattle and our ... just a little bit later on his own social media outlets are Facebook is hope for the caregiver or on Facebook or Twitter killed his hope the number four caregiver\nAnd then the podcast you can do to standing with hope dot com and you'll see a Bush is subscribe to free bugged yes you'll be right there is just we put the show up there put clips of the show all kinds of things that we have out there and we put the resources out there for you\nAnd we want you to take advantage of them and uh and soup standing with the dot com where the music or you can hear Gracie in Johnny uh sing a couple of do it so they're they're just phenomenal through at all because he lives with you here in the blow your mind\nAnd and get involved and what we're doing support if you like what you're hearing here do you do you do you find value in what we're doing that I'm asking you support and help us do more\nUm too often I have found that the big issues of our of our culture or being defined by people that um\n[noise] let me just back up\nLeading the charge on helping the family caregiver in a way that no one else is doing I have the largest presence out there across the country on radio and I I'm committed to this I I I Am so\nPassionate about helping the family caregiver whether it's give them information about legislation whether it's give them information about their water heater I don't care I'm going to strengthen these folks I'm asking for your help to do it if I'm not doing it who's going to\nEnd who's going to bring the resume that I bring with it and so that's a bold statement but this is we need to be able to determine this so I'm asking for your help build a stadium was hope dot com today and get involved and Gracie um unless you have the last\nWord you're ... when I say ten seconds that means ten seconds darling I come on up here that gets it and we had to cut you off because we have heartbreak oh God love you know ... ... are you ... you would generally just gave a great interview and and I'm I'm going to put it up there\nI was reminded about that Senate bill to OU six thirty three six build up six or through not put all of this out of there on the ... I guess you'll be able to fund it\nYou know ... love what you said there that that you had those moments and you know I didn't know you\nWhen you first get hurt so I didn't I think people think\nThat you know we did not\nEnough [laughter] to you for that clarification or [laughter]\nYou know I didn't know you when you got her I didn't know those those despair I've seen you would rather just spare moments of goals or their despair which but during that initial time of the wreck when you're thinking you're Seventeen years old and you wake up in your whole body is broken at one time or a or a resident wants told us that you had two hundred breaks\nOr for this car Rick I mean it just devastating courage\nAnd there's no way you you thought you could ever live like this uh so uh I I I heard when I hear those things have you being Seventeen Eighteen years old and your your begging friends for a razor blade or ... or sleeping pills to be able to just to check out\nAnd and look at the life that you live you've lived to see your grandchildren and people were walking in Africa because if you people are walking in Nigeria because a few people or or or getting hope in in this show because you lived\nIn you've understood that life is so important last words ... and what are the one minute no kid one minute last words\nI what I said\nOh crap when I realized over a minute ago I was gonna say that's one of\nHe's had cancer a couple of different times his dad passed away in his early sixties of cancer and he's like I don't know how much time I have left I'm retiring\nAnd so he did he was a schoolteacher so we had the pension you know and it was one of those things that he could do and he just is never going to live in a super extravagant lifestyle that's not him\nI mean but he can do what he wants to do and he still does some things for the school district so he still gets a little bit more money coming in but he's able to do what he wants and enjoy whatever he's got left I I think he kind of\nA under sells himself and his future but but that's just me but the ideas what if you do want to retire sooner water some of the challenges John that that goes into\nYou know retirees say at fifty five there it's different retiring fifty five sixty five 'cause there are a lot of rules and regulations to get that retirement money\nWell let's talk about those but the big thing I Want to stress before we get too much further is\nIts retirement doesn't have to be an age it doesn't have to be you know ... ... people are looking at as a destination and they want to get to that retirement [noise]\nMore often than not people come in and sit down and we'll have conversations in and we'll look at their finances and we'll look at all their assets and we start talking about what their goals and dreams are and they start projecting out when I retire when I retire and you know they might be fifty five ... mark that's a great time that people come in is when they're in their fifties\nAnd they really start you know looking at what the future is going to hold because they want to get out of where they are\nIn after having a conversation with them you know I look and I go why are you wait until sixty for a while you wait until sixty two but um you can go right now so I don't want people to be constricted\nWith just a age number just like you mentioned your buddy who was fifty five let's look at what it is you want to do how much you have and can we make it happen and it may take and it's going to take a few changes probably a few you know modifications a in a few understanding of some of these things were going to talk about today so\nYeah so let's let's touch on some of the rules of getting to a four O. one K. or getting to an IRA before the age of fifty nine and a half\nBecause that's that's kind of the one to hold back and then there's another big question and that would be health care so we'll we'll touch on that as well but let's first start with some of the rules I mean Iraq can't get to it until I'm fifty nine and a half four O. one K. sometimes I can be for sometimes maybe\n... ... you are correct so if you're coming out of\nUm the employer sponsored plan so the four o one K for all three B a four fifty seven some of these things\nIf you sever employment after fifty five so if you're fifty five are older and you are still employed or not employed because you're suffering employment but your if your money is still in the qualified planner inside that four O. one K. for all three B\nYou can take money out of that plan without any penalty you still pay tax on the money but you don't have that ten percent penalty\nIf we're looking at the IRA world and some of these uh you know different I Will just the traditional i._r._a.\nIt is fifty nine and a half we have to weigh two before we pulled money out of there without getting a tempers have penalty so the four oh one K. that is about the biggest advantage aside from a forced savings plan is being the biggest to bash before all and K\nBut the the allowing of money to come out of that plan inside the four oh one K. so they can they can take money out of fifty five and um\nYeah when you're no longer employed by that but uh basically so you're basically they're retired he got laid off there's a lot of I mean that that happens does that happen often do you have many people that get laid off and then go you know what I think I could just go ahead and retire\nThey start to look at it they come in and they sit down um than in the end we we start to look at some of their finances and we look at uh something else you mentioned health care and we're going to touch on that in a second because I Want to spend some time that as well [noise]\nUm because it used to be a real barrier before we had healthcare reform people were like well I I gotta stay working because you know I'm you know unfortunately sometimes ... and one of the stories I think of as a couple that\nThey came in and they said you know we wanna we wanna retire but I Can't retire because my spouse has MS and I can't get health insurance well now we can so health health insurance and then again I don't want to divert too much on that 'cause they'll cover it but\nYou know let's stick with the the IRA they go oh my gosh I can retire I can get healthcare I Can't afford to do\nThis so what we look at inside the four oh one K. is and then you know we're never strong proponents of leaving money inside the four o one K plan\nBecause if you roll that money out after you retire there's so many other places you can put that probably so many better options are Bush say more choices the of the University of choice when you get it out of the four o\nOne K plan but leave enough in there to maybe that supplies are supports your income for the next four or five years until we can get to the IRA or until we can get to some of your other assets that you know aren't going to have any penalties on the one we draw the money\nAnd that's really a by I think it it's it's a big decision but it's not something that I think just the average person can just do that can they can they just say well I'm going to pull money out of my four oh one K. are there\nI mean does it get a little complicated or not yes when I was thinking there's a little bit more than just going okay I guess they're no longer work I'm just to start pulling money from my four oh one K. and you do have to remember whether it's four one K.

had a great quote if he ever did you know he used to carry a note around in his pocket\nAnd they're not that you did not he had a note in his pocket that said see John Nathan seems said call John ... after he said call John David it was\nBasically just I'll just summarize 'cause I Know are running short on time in the segment but it was a\nHe read it every single day we kept it in his wallet and was basically a note that says that ah the gist of it was [noise]\nMake sure that what you're doing today is what is purposeful passionate and exciting to you because you're exchanging a day of your

passion to find your purpose make sure you have enough money to do it called us six one five six five six zero zero nine nine\nSo we're talking about the idea of retiring sooner one of the biggest areas that are really critical when it comes to retiring soon\nSooner rather than later and say you're retiring before the age of sixty five healthcare you've got to have it and how are you going to do it that's our topic when we come back stay with us this is retired federal John even which on navy and associates\nCollege graduate professors at you and you see are very knowledgeable they work in the industry because I got a degree from you I'm you see I got promotions that helped me move up in the world and earn more from my family\nOr in your degree on line for Murphy\n\nIs retire fit I'm pleased to hear what John haven of John ... says his John works with is fine with all the financial plan designed help focus on living out a fulfilling for\nRetirement and we're talking about not just one thing we're not talking just about finances we're also talking about personal health physical health we're talking about everything kind of working together because if you have money and you don't have health doesn't sound like a good retirement\nYou have health but you have no money let's not probably good either and then you have money and you have health\nBut you have no personal balance in your life there is no really good thing that you know I mean it all goes together and and the idea is to try to get everything on the same page going in the same direction you rode the boat and the same direction\nSo that's kind of what we're talking about today or do we are talking about the idea of retiring sooner some of the challenges that that poses\nAnd if you'd like sit down with John Connor to find out a little bit more about where you are and you wrote to retirement six one five six five six zero zero nine nine no cost normally Geisha no pressure to sit down with John six one five six five six\nZero zero nine nine one of the biggest hurdles to that decision of I'm going to retire at fifty five for example or I'm going to retire at sixty\nIs certainly Social Security has kicked in yet so we'll talk will touch on that here and just a bit as well but health care Medicare doesn't kick in until sixty five can you still keep some insurance at work even though you're retired there is a ... that's a big part of this equation of being able to retire\nSooner rather than later would be the health care aspect isn't it\nIt is yeah and uh you know we've had this health\nCare reform going on for the last eight years and we're not sure what Trump is going to do with with a unraveling and I'd always be talked about unraveling at them shirts unraveled\nA or it is on rebel just to some extent and so it's a constant question that we're always asked and I have been you know a strong proponent and I'm not going politically here but my youngest daughter Julia is a diabetic and she's been diabetics as he was four\nAnd so when the the healthcare reform came about um [noise]\nIt really was a big positive change not only for my daughter but it was a positive change for a lot of people that we talk to because\nYou know with with my daughter being diabetic finding health insurance we had to stay on group plans or you know we couldn't go into our own individual planned\nUm because we couldn't get coverage [noise] a lot of people that we're we're talking with that come in for retirement face that same challenge because somebody has a\nIllness or something happened where traditionally before the health care reform and they made health insurance all guaranteed issue so no health insurance has all guaranteed issue so anybody can get health insurance anywhere whether it's through the exchange which again is not our area and I'm not a hundred percent familiar with it\nBut you can go to any carrier and get health insurance is guaranteed issue if that doesn't mean the price is you know favorable but we do we can get coverage so if you have\nSomeone in your family that you're going okay I don't I you know we have the means to retire I can afford to retire\nBut it's just this health insurers we won't get health and search you can now get health insurance so that was a huge deal for my my diabetic daughter because we couldn't get health insurance but now she is covered and she always was covered but she can get covered under an individual plan versus a group playing so I was dressed the folks that we can do it\nWe got a budget it\nI also hear sometimes a price wise people come in and they go oh my gosh it's cost a fortune to buy health insurance you know it's going to cost me two thousand dollars a month ago I was talking to my neighbor and my neighbor said\nNo it it's not always that expensive and we've got resources and people that we can help get your health insurance so a critical component for sure we do need the coverage because Medicare doesn't kick in sixty five\nBut isn't that that's one of the challenges because sometimes you can leave and and your employment will still allow you that what's that killed when they\nAre we can cobra ... for Eighteen months if the employers big enough I think you need more than fifty employees are I Know they\nCan get very expensive though yes\nColbert and get expensive but you can also you don't have to stay on that plan because now they have the portability law where you can move from your group sponsored plan and doing it ... individual plan and there is no longer preexisting conditions so they have to take you and it just depends on the plane they're coming from\nYou know what your cost will be or what your your benefits will be in that way but this is\nProbably one of the biggest expenses that you will have isn't it\nYes yes it will so to get to be expensive for sure especially if you get the age six so really what\nYou're saying is just let the ... you're saying if you find somebody that you know so you can have the coverage I'm saying just\nRoll the dice come on there's nothing you got to tell you [laughter] so\nMark is not the one that you want to call you have if you're going to retire because if you roll the dice do not listen to that if you roll the dice now whether you jeopardizing you're jeopardizing\nA basically everything on one because you I mean one bad health they could wipe out your\nTime you don't really it really is amazing because I Do think that the health care and I think it's one of the challenges and I know that's one of the areas that you'll talk about in the lifestyle maximize or\nYou know when when people come in and you're going to talk about income planning on going to talk about investment planning on and talking about tax plan together and talk about health and long term care legacy an estate planning because all of that is part of the lifestyle maximize er and it's the well rounded you know the the physical the financial the personal all of that working together\nBut at the end of the day when you think about something happening most of us don't think last never going to happen to me you know you drive by a car wreck on the ... that's crazy I Can't believe that just happened right over there was never going to happen to me well I've got a friend that is fifty six years of age\nMen diabetic like kind of like your daughter Julia for a long long time so he's had the companies that different things and he's my golfing partners what he is well we played in a tournament I'm In the Ozarks
