make\nThis a book [laughter] the the big lighter that's if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against the tightly gripped finger around the

it like you did before\nI rarely meaning to it [laughter]\nAny here\nEvery three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could you know\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to to talk about tonight turn off the television and sit down at the kitchen table tonight look at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people and pour it all on to this rental for two years is this rental worth that to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or going to have you know horn and we want to sell it\nBut I don't want to know that I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rental ... if the best way to do do it is to live debt free the\nNationally live debt free\nYeah stop it and\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah so um you know decide because I think\nYou are really doing good until we got to Home Depot and then borrowed money for rental and then you kind of like lost your mind for a minute\nOr so\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much I you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get by to ready to buy rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with this rental\nBut I Would do one of the

eight hundred grand okay my goodness gracious ... so what in the whole world this was a ... ... is our numbers\nYeah Dave it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses so um you know for a long time we had to have the new everything and the nice everything luckily for us bus for us that we had a decent income to what I'll do for a live with all that\nWell I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy\nAnd I said how can these two little lady Hossam ... okay an auto\nUm yeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I listen to your show probably for about\nEight months leading up to this and you know for me it was pride and ego just you know I'm too sophisticated for that that's best for other people and um I came to realize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just\nListening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold a a lake house we sold a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but\nWe made it through and knocked it out and so excited my\nGoodness gracious so I don't er thousand as your typical year's income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years this range between eight and one point to run\nYou know obviously ... Wheldon so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the lake al spring with the Beatles springs\nSo the the ah the net off the lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\nOkay but the ... I mean the one point five included the pay off with a mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing by the force Seventy and what a reduced yeah ...\n... the cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we owe about a hundred and twenty less than that okay\nAnd that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off shore okay sure so the ... a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this right was done with these two properties oh yeah oh yeah wow\nYeah on All right at all of the aisle of the extra staff which is a challenge whenever you eat or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to get it at a lake and how and mark caught me on board\nThink what made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are\nOne of those the cheaper one the four Seventy one in ... worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah I'll sign you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity as all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nHe wasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] that was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually sat down and she ... said I really don't have a hard time and again I mean I'm\nA ... what's your all income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the ... what's your wired\nIt was really difficult to to give up something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that ... but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have you know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show them and so we had you know we kind of had to have\nSitting there was this child is there an option for this child I mean we were just so thankful Joan was in some school that he had somewhere to go that they cared about it is it just child is like a\nIs it happy to be there or is she is a girl boy what it was they had it would be the end of a or do they have somewhere else they they would be if they didn't know if they couldn't make it at this place\n[noise] um well it's it's not Harris now where we all land and\nGoodness had her I keep thinking excuse me I have I think you're right\n... well when you're halfway in either go you know high that have to go and get your electric educational there if you don't get a car or on the higher you go in and really happy when I called the parents\nAin't bad wow that is that I share all this and you know\nI when when we took Joan of news about three or four and we we struggle in this one church and the one guy that was kind of in charge of the sun is good he was really nice but people in the church they know what to do just being around child like that and then we went to St Louis and see photos people does he needed somebody to take care of him each son to be a different one and we felt\nSo included in that and you know that they were so nice about an eager to help the it it's probably Twenty years\nWill argue we're going to say\nWell I Would just echo what Rob said about or not over thinking you're doing you just said you said a a book for when you said the parents said you're the first one that's caused you know that me that's I mean that's what he said about being a good person about just reaching out beat treating normal\nAnd ... you know everyone has something this child has that to deal with\nYou know when when my kids were growing up kids are pretty resilient and my kids were growing up and when their mother became an amputee\nYou know they didn't really make a big deal about every day one time there was a deer in the yard and Parker comes running and he was just a little kid and he said mom get your lego guy come see just like you know it just laying on what your leg momma I was just like but you know kids just kind of adapt and so the best gift you can give\nTo that child to that child's family into the classroom and to the parish itself\nIs to integrate the whole dynamic with it and just let it be just they're just normal it's just we got adaptive equipment we got special needs okay big work\nAnd and that's how you do it it's not that like Rob said you just don't want to overstate it too much\nYou could be worse you could have a personality like Peter's yeah oh yeah how do you do about that [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's a series of it goes to school problems for years or older person that does is it to the super did the study [laughter] do they even have the to the sun that's good [laughter] so uh that that question I don't know that's a that was my life so [laughter] I listed as\nSoon as the thanks so much for the call just for the dialogue were happened and we hope this has been helpful I Want to give a big shut up to uh my friend Rob you deal more over in North Carolina because I Know this is an issue that is deeply passionate to him and they're listening over there and the Winston Salem area and are working with an awful lot of special needs

know pretty much every guy I Know wants to hear that from their dad a man too and so\nAs you think about that with your dad saying that about you and all the challenges you've dealt with Down syndrome things you've had to not be able to do and participate I Know there's things that you want to do and and you you can't do them very well and so forth as far as driving and things like that that frustrates you what's your dad says you're a wise man [noise]\nYes I Am [laughter] there you go All right how does how does how does that\nMake you feel as you look at your dad you guys have been through some some some rough rivers together my yeah my dad\nForty years and I ... I was born in Minnesota ... sent about ... people can survive out there\nWho Minnesota and I asked about four years old and I graduated from high school [noise] and you got an award there ... yes I did what a ward was it was the best courage for people with Down syndrome against them in large Scott hallmark actually\nYeah it was a hallmark award for graduating student with the most courage wasn't for doubt yeah it was just ... courage the entire student body in the times Hillsborough ... had a fairly large graduating class big surprise for us but the air and his wife and he's also modest [laughter]\nWell I think that I think there's no higher praise that you can illicit from your father from any go from misspoke than their father to say that you're was man so well done young men will do it\nYou know when I first came to the studio and last year we talking about the mullahs from up and Down syndrome must pass I have just parents with my girlfriend ... ... ... years I Know her for a long time when I first heard about um\nMy ... who is in a man on the camera he's my mind as a caregiver ... Sabre and my first time at la ... can tendency I ... I came to his contract ... see him play a great job on that\nHe's pretty good as ... for for a man of his age unlimited yeah she says All right\n[laughter] so do you spend a lot of people can't Samy right now ...\nIs the stuff I'm doing I'm done and the legacy of Elvis and that's why I'm doing a legacy keeps his music alive\nWe'll you're doing a great job with that of Greg parting thoughts we got just about a minute or two left of it really don't even that much but just real quick\nWilling to take away a Susan's call in her concerns about this child in a wheelchair and and hope\nThat she and some of the other listeners were able to benefit from what we suggested but it's it's an example of how individual each situation is and how challenging it is\nOnly got fifty four thousand left on their own\nOkay right\nOkay so she moves out you move in and around that you sell your house oh how much will you're much equity we get out of your house\nMaybe go out and not very much at all\nOkay I like celebrate the baby the baby step to a little bit he he ... the payments not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what the interest rate is on the loan\nUm lets her she writes refinanced about I'm ... years ago and I would imagine that it's not very high\nYou know it's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to assume you could get a mortgage that was a very similar rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on and baby step three but it's going to take you a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year more to live there\nRight [noise]\nWell I don't know if I Would do it uh just because of emotions uh but this is not a bad thing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting it your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it\nAnd so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you will have to move\nAs you say no now she needs to just sell the house right ... thank God so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract we obligated as we are going to go into Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment and we want a written contract that we're renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere\nUm there is a brother\nIn and get on a by going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this equity given to you\nKnow you sure\nAs far as I understand that now\nThere yeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pollen talking about this this is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so yeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease\nIt with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance okay lease it\nFor the payment with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just sell it then and that's no different than her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nYeah it doesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe\nI'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay personal finances personal and that doesn't mean it's situational e ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go hey that data item\nYou know that a car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not selling that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway about three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I was about the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference and they both of them are car both of them are sitting in the driveway both of them are transaction that needs to occur\nBut we're going to factor in you know that there's something real ... about the connectivity to the item and its reason reasonable people would acknowledge that can activity you cannot do personal finance without it also being personally\nThat's why people don't get out there who don't get mad enough and you've got to get mad and getting mad so personal and\nIt was like I'm sick and tired of being sort of Darwin makes so much money one world how stupid or we were about to change our lives now see that's how impartial and\nLike this is the day Ramsey show\nOn radio Ninety eight point three ...

in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight okay so it's still a good deal\nBut
