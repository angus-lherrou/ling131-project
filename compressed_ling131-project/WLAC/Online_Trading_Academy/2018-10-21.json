I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing what happened was sharing a nine Jody when we went broke was we should never again\nNever again they'll take a phone call if somebody calls us collecting money it's a wrong number\n... okay in life is God\nAnd there's nothing I Want bad enough to go back into the news again\nWhere the borrower slave to the lender that's our decision that's how we decided to live that's what we teach people the goal is it's kind of like the holy grail that Iran's you show rocket everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and now you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms\nI couldn't do it\nIt makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it but if you do it\nYou know that you're just living a different things so you called me to ask me my opinion [noise] what would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and I said I never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really work hard to save up the money for it\nAnd I have to sacrifice other stuff to get it and then it makes me go I like my lifestyle but I don't know like those two more bedroom so I'm probably not going to cut my lifestyle down to nothing to get this which is kind of what you just said and I show um which is okay that's okay choice you made the choice though but what that does is it allows us to buy something we can't afford\nShow I mean you can do whatever you want to do what you and I'll be friends I'm not really mad at you but you called the Dave Ramsey showing us to borrow money\nAnd it just new you're not ever going to get a yes on\nThat one um so\nIt just makes me sad that you would go back in so I I Would 'cause I I think he doesn't stop and measure the freedom that you have the sense of peace that you have the economy turned down to ... for back then if you did that feel\nWhen the world is falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere because I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occurred on them home with a mortgage\nSo\nWe just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece in great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in down times\nEnjoy to not have a ... named country wide on my back\nBank of America on my back can't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just ... I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad\nCarl is with us in Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nI'd Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping you can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off the way to go\nSend it back when he fixed um but my relationship with a guy changed in the sense that it it it took on a very ... ... an immediacy that I'd maybe didn't have before and it because there was a lot of\nTimes it was you know they talk about one day at a time there were times when we were in ten minutes and come back to stare at the worst of it and and I will say that there were times I I don't believe that there is a demon called alcoholism that jumps on you when you're not looking I Believe that um I absolutely know that it is\nA chronic disease I'm I Know that her at a tea and and environment to play a huge role and what we came to understand is that trauma plays a huge giant role in it\nBut it also is a spiritual battle and again our story is not one that I prayed put my hands on him and pray that\nHe was instantly healed or anybody else did that either we we were the go to therapy go to leading scale you know we were that\nCouple you work in a way it's worked it absolutely is worth it is a process but I Will say there were times\nAnd at the very end before he went to be treated specifically for trauma and that was when it hit it was he was most out of control\nAnd it was the first time ironically I'd ever seen him actually drunk um and it was right when he was never frightening and he was never violent or um but it was I was watching somebody I Love self destruct\nBut there were times right at the end before he went to trauma treatment where I literally was I'm next to him in bed and he was sound asleep\nAnd or passed out and I had my hand on his shoulder and I was\nI was saying you're not going to get him\nYou're not going to get it ... you've got his father\nHe got his brother you're not going to get them and whatever that force is that is behind destruction\nAnd and that comes to steal and tail and destroy that's who I there was a point on which was very clear to me that's that's\nWho the enemy was and that's what I was fighting the alcoholism disease of alcoholism was a symptom of a lot of trauma and a lot of\nThings that you know that's that's the medication to the problem and a lot to lose it and it becomes a problem but it's not the core problem than ever is out of the ... and you get a big if that's if that's if that's what they're thinking is the is the solution just imagine how bad the problem is\nWhen I was never danced on a table with a lamp shade on his head\nHis he didn't party his drinking was solitary and he wanted to get as ... as possible as quickly as possible it was to shut\nThe voices down and so um there wasn't\nIt was it was secretive and and alone and I'm dark it it was not he he wasn't like a frat boy he um he was suffering and he was trying to quiet the voices\n... we're going to take a break can you hang on to the break\nAnd so there's a story to she's talking about the new movie I still believe was she in Russia and their whole lives are put on display for you to get stronger and healthier as you're dealing with this maybe in a loved one that you have with alcoholism is hope for the caregiver this is your last one to place where you could get ...\nHealthier in there I said even more ... dealing with some very harsh realities like alcohol is\nWe'll be right back do go\nTo a council\nBack to the show ... hosted by giving the speed of Roseburg you're bringing your three decades of experience to help\nYou stay strong and healthy as you take care of someone who is not ... we're talking with toy retailer is a she and her husband rushed to have a new movie coming out told I still believe it will be on an October thirtieth or one night only ...\nYeah that's kinda hard to fathom that do it if we have a big giant turnout\nThey might do an encore performances maybe the next month or something that I don't know this is all new to me\nWell let's let's try to lose trying to make dinner but by the way um I was trying to get 'em forgiven chewed up and we couldn't get it in time you were a little technical difficulties with John ... with the next best thing to rush which was Joe\nCocker neither [laughter] that's that's the closest we can find [laughter] ah but there's a let's\nTry to get the turnout because it's important that we support movies like this this these roasted tore are putting their their Journey Out for everyone to see with the hopes of winning you\nTwo crushed to walking in place of health and ... as a family it if you don't just have one individual sick to buy alcohol is a or anything else or chronic pain or anything else it's a family issue\nI'm torn let me ask you a question if you were you were just sitting down right\nNow which somebody over a cup of coffee who just found themselves about their ... they're they're just in shell shock or whatever um what would you say to\n'em\n... you had a brother psychologist you you grew up in a strong Christian home there are a lot of people don't get that\nAnd they're actually they're losing the show right now some of the ears listening to this rock now maybe certainly some buddies and they don't have those kinds of things and so that's I think that's the responsibility you and I have is is people have just been through where there's a lotta storms okay now it's our turn\nDuring the ... points to Paso just share your heart with him over a cup of coffee what would you say\nWell I can ... the first thing I Would say is I I feel you\nAnd and I haven't walked in your shoes that I have been in my shoes in a similar situation and\nUm and I can hold states for you and I can listen to you the second thing I Would say is that for me and I and my journey our journey is the only one I can reference or with any\nAuthenticity because the one I Walk 'em knowledge with power for me because rats drank secretly I felt like a shadow boxing I could feed behavior changes I could see it desperately unhappy man but I didn't have anything depended on I couldn't say oh\nI'm accept depression but but it was beyond that and so finding out about\nA disease of addiction what's really important for me um I needed to know what I was up again and third um\nI got it you know every time I start talking about well that and and now in on it that's not at a club or any of that really want to join um they had the same that Alan odd that nobody gets here on a good day but the reality is no one is going to understand it and one is going to get it\nMore than people who are walking through it and I can honestly say and however jeeze Thirty years of thinking and Allen I made it I never left the lady and I think I think I can say this out I'm a doubt that never left the meeting without lapping\nHard at least one time and there were times when I was in Allen on meeting when I desperately\nNeeded a laugh and I could because those walls or stay um and those people understood [noise] um I wouldn't waste I Would I Would encourage someone to not waste time I'm beginning themselves up and not waste energy on trying to\nYou're not you're not you're she she's fine hey thanks for the call Katie is with us in Maryland Hi Katie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nOkay so um I have thought cleans here I'll go through them quickly I I've been with my class for Twenty years I relocated hertz Maryland closer because they called ... and um I make\nSeventy five thousand a year my husband to be\nI'm thirty five [noise] what do you do forty I claim because after you do what I met ... auto claims adjuster\nClaims adjuster okay good\nHer and we have forty five thousand dollars in debt ah we purchased a house fires here we have two hundred and Twenty one ... ... to me the ethical fat met her in two thousand and twenty ... ...\n... I had a hundred and kind of cool falcon metro on ... ah how my question is the first of all I could relocate to a different city but I don't want him I really like it here in ... why or why would you need to do that\nI'm I'm afraid that I Will make as much if I look for another job why are you leaving your company\nOh I'm Sorry their clothes and hair next August oh well yeah OK rather than that you can do so I we we want to stay here mhm not the other part is that if I stay home that okay\nI'll get back into the equivalent of about thirty two week mhm I'm I'm thinking after it get hit with taxes\nAnd because I currently have the health benefits that it's probably not going to come out\nTo enough that court waiting for oh yeah I'm Wondering what\nKind of depends on what kind of a job you get I mean if you get a job making eighty grandma it\nMight not be worth waiting for because you might trade out the service for the stability but um I mean we're talking about thirty five thousand bucks or minus taxes\nAnd that's not you know there's no chump change\nBut it'd be a nice thing to have around\nParticularly how deeply indebted you guys are so um you know your tax rate is twenty two percent and so it's not only be taxes about five six seven thousand bucks so now after taxes taxes are not going to eat it all up so what what has happening here is um\nYou've been hit\nAnd got the wind knocked out have you with this announcement and um I think you're immediately assuming negative things why don't we look around and like for ... I think we might get a job making instead of Seventy five maybe we'll get a job making eighty five\nWhen you lose a job it is not a federal law that you have to take a job making ...\n\nSometimes it's a blessing that you'd lose the job especially with these people they moved you because they were going broke and now they've gone broke I mean my gosh wow so my guess is they're not over paying people\nIncluding you\nSo I don't know that you you know I don't know that you're overpaid or your overcompensate insurance claims adjuster generally can make good money you may have to do a little traveling or something like that and um you know follows from hurricanes around or something or whatever but you\nGenerally can make pretty good money in in that world and I've talked to him that it might twice what you're making now again that sometimes involves travel one I'm Talking about that but um\nYou know I I think you guys work your way out of debt get as far as that is you can and I'd be looking for jobs post taste and if you get a job that you can\nLand in the above what you're making now you might punt the severance but the ideal world would be that you would start the next week after they wrote you a severance check in the service check comes you're signing bonuses for your new life\nAnd that that's ideal world if you get a new job making Ninety five is such a week after years yeah that'd be sweet [noise]\nThis is the Dave Ramsey show\nSense advice that works weekdays from five to eight on TALK radio Ninety eight point three hands Fifteen ten W. L. A. C.\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you\nIf you have a spouse or you have
