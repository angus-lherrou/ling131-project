your friends and neighbors are sharing likely the same concerns you have are the the the uncertainty of the economy and how long this is going to go I talked to apply this week that's a truck\nA he calls it instead of Murphy's law his last name as the law saying you know as soon as I sense that things are good I can see the market going bad this is a climate lost fifty percent\nIce between two thousand one two thousand two that was one or two and then again between two thousand eight and early two thousand nine and he said you know I Can't afford to do that and folks he's right you know this is the client\nA wife or his wife are in their mid to late sixties between the two of them and the reality is they don't have time to make up for another two thousand and eight or two thousand two thousand and two market debacle and many people are predicting even the great Warren Buffet that it's not a matter of gift\nIt's a matter of when and when is unfortunately going to cause what some are even claiming to be the worst recession or the worst economic downturns in their lifetime and these are folks that are talking about this that are well respected on Wall street that have been doing what they're they've been doing now for forty years folks\nLook here's here's the importance of this point right and I and I think this is this is key the the top retirement solutions that others miss\nIs the tax peace now this is the tax piece impact us all heavens no it doesn't impact us all because a lot of people haven't but due to this retirement crisis it's been proven with all the polls a lot of people haven't saved\nAppropriately for retirement and they're going to be in big trouble we talked about the pyramid right the pyramid back in the day for a lot of us thinking about our parents or grandparents retirement\nWas very simple a a good solid foundation of that pyramid was our pension than it was our Social Security and the little peek at the top of the pyramid was money that we could generate off of our savings well now you got to take that pyramid and in standard on it's on it's on its ear because now it's the opposite\n[noise] now we need the majority very little is coming from pensions\nAnd then of course Social Security is obviously been restricted with low cost of living adjustments the threat of a being cut Twenty one percent within technically the next\nRoughly Fifteen to Twenty years and the fact that most people went from a defined benefit pension paid by the employer to a ... defined contribution plan which is what I call the yo yo plan which stands for your on\nYour own right you eat what you kill what you put away is what you're going to get to draw from and that's what's causing a lot of people to not be able to retire or retire with a lifestyle that they had envisioned\nAnd the good as as it doesn't have to be that way folks but the harsh reality as we're on our own for the majority of you listening and I know this by having a front row seat with baby boomers now for going on to a quarter century read twenty three to twenty four years we're in and have had a front row seat with boomers and I've learned a very real things\nThat uh prevent and boomers from having an optimal retirement in here here's what they are some of these are basic but we're going to get into the specifics number one even force had a great article that said the number one thing that's preventing people from having the retirement that they could have is number one having a plan\nSo that one seems pretty common sense right having a plan I just talked to two clients this last week and by the way I'm not just a a best selling author or radio educator I'm someone with my wealth architecture team that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year all over the United states and I can tell you [laughter]\nThe reality is these particular clients have said you know what we've never had a full fledged plan some of them said we've never had a plan and many of them said in particular two of them this past week we've never taken the time to actually do a budget Chuck in your budget woke us up what I call a lifestyle\nIncome budget that is in other words not just the essentials but the wants to travel more to do more while you can to see your grand kids as they grow up and they said you know what we had no idea we had that much money going out and folks that's the that's the real first step\nThe second step is than implementing a plan\nThe third step in probably the most crucial the Forbes article went on to say was then managing the plan for further optimization so here's what I Want to encourage you the importance ... more so probably than ever before in my career I'm seeing\nAs the investigation into the optimization\nOf an actual full fledged holistic comprehensive whatever you want to call a plan that incorporates tax strategy solutions to save tax folks because as much as I'm for these tax cuts somebody's gonna have to pay for them\nAnd ... that somebody or those that have worked hard and if they even harder and typically it's because they've saved and accounts that the accounts until they start drawing money out have not been taxed yet\nWhich means deferred taxes equal increased taxes because the cost of living will increase of the distribution out of those accounts will have to increase the net the higher amount and needed to spend\nBut add to the fact ... you know tax tax reform one point oh and now the passing through the house of tax reform to point out all of these cuts\nIs causing massive increases to our deficit now we're seeing some positive things come from that but some of them folks are false positives the corporations cutting their tax to buy back their own stock to keep the party rolling\nIt can only last so long until they run out of the ability to do the buybacks and artificially that's propped our market's up candidly for about the last three years if not for\nSo it's kind of prolong the party the folks the lights are going to have to go out at some point in having a plan that not only addresses taxes but also addresses the protection to the downside ride a few clients this week said you know what I really like about in well solution as you guys find\nTax savings in wealth strategies that other people miss and folks it it's not just seeing what people are missing it's a ... where the advantages are in the timing of having the advantages and I gotta tell ya [noise]\nOutside of the the chance of Trump getting uh unfortunately uh impeached which could make a lot of these tax cuts a timing go away very quickly\nIs the fact that they're going to expire unless this permanent tax cut gets put through but even if this permanent tax cut gets put through the reality is the tax magnitude for those that have worked the hardest and save the hardest is going to be even greater\nAnd let me make sure that you understand the the the ... the key if you don't remember anything else I share with you remember these two words shifting and timing and we'd like to say in our practice shift\nBut it happens as part of his strategy to a comprehensive plan other words one client I'll I'll share a couple of days with you that I thought were very impactful because ... folks just didn't see it right so for example\nA client was very taken back recently because they were going to have to have eight earnings provision penalty on their Social Security benefits that they never knew they were going to have meaning over Seventeen thousand forty dollars of before full retirement age you draw your Social Security [noise]\nEvery two dollars you're over Seventeen thousand forty dollars you basically have to give one dollar back\nThey had no idea if you've not drawn your Social Security for a full twelve months you can get a redo\nIt but you've got to see what makes the most sense for you and we had another client that learned how eighty five percent of their Social Security would be taxed because of a choice of the type of pension payout that they would elect\nAs opposed to doing a lump sum roll over which would enable them strategically to avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security taxed now here's the big one right\nOne particular client had no idea that\nIn the new tax reform bill now the taxes are on sale maybe not permanently but at least temporarily which means take advantage of the sale while the sale last that there's a one hundred percent tax reduction\nThat can be is between now in the end of twenty twenty to that one client we met with this week we were able to move two hundred and eighty thousand dollars out of his remaining IRA and the net result is paying zero tax for those qualify under the special provision of the code\nAnd finally [laughter]\nWe had a client who was unaware right that the legislation now that's being passed is to prevent this stretch IRA meaning before when the second spouse passes the remainder of the IRA can be passed on to the next generation and then there's an inherited required minimum\nTo ... over their inherited age lifetime will now Congress although it's passed a hundred percent before in the Senate a few years ago its back on the chopping block and likely to be passed in a recent article that now any inherited irate money has to be fully closed out in under five years\nWhich means when people can afford the tax the least while they're making the most they are going to be forced to take a distribution that indirectly makes Uncle Sam the biggest beneficiary of your IRA\nFolks I'm going to be teaching this coming Tuesday an introduction of how to on tax the the growth of your money on tax the distribution in use of your money and untaxed the concern of leading attacks the unfortunate penalty to your children and I'm going to be teaching it in a complementary educational Web and our\nThis Tuesday and you can register well space is still available go to retirement protected dot com that's retirement protected dot com and register now if you're married it couldn't be more important time even though one spouse predominant makes the financial choices for the family\nI'm a big believer in tax cuts unfortunately what the government's not telling you is where they're going to go collect the needed tax from from these tax cuts and it's very simple it's going to come from you in the form of your IRA distributions with a higher tax rate because it's going to push you into a higher tax rate\nEventually as they changed the tax rates if especially if they're not made permanent which I think's a long shot and taxing your Social Security taxing more of your Medicare part B Andy premiums called penalties\nAnd folks who doesn't have to be that way out to be teaching this Tuesday or I'm going to be teaching introduction of how to grow money without tax use it without tax and not leave a tax burden to your

recession economic certain actors are expected to go higher and report the deficit are and [noise]\nPrevent me didn't wealth radio host best selling author shock all over\nHis mission is helping you discovered and uncover your hidden well\nProtect yourself from taxes inflation and market losses\nJust shut down for welcome to hidden wealth radio when we help baby boomers and business owners secure\nA safe retirement safe by insulating there are serious retirement savings from unnecessary market losses as well as unnecessary taxation\nThat one client said you know what I Love about the hidden well solution is you do help people discovered uncover retirement opportunities and wealth strategies that others miss a baby boomers are in particular I'm Talking to those of you listening between the ages of sixty and Seventy five\nAnd particularly to those that have saved at least two hundred fifty thousand or more towards retirement I Want to share with you a story in particular about friends and colleagues just like yourself all within that age group\nThat are sharing what they are real concerns are in properly positioning themselves for their most optimal retirement opportunities and what boomers are sharing in that age group in with that asset range of two hundred fifty thousand to typically\nTwo three four five million dollars or more but at least a quarter million is that they're worried about the economy\nAnd they're very concerned about losing money to the federal government the form of unnecessary taxes and I want to talk to you about a really just in its simplest form a couple a Cindy and Jerry uh they're in their sixties\nAnd uh we up Cindy retire [noise] ah we actually met her shortly after retirement who helped her position her retirement and then we're helping Jerry get retired so if you're somebody listening that is getting one or both spouses to retirement or you're trying to get better through retirement\nI don't think the timing of this message could be any more valuable and I want to I like to teach so I'm not just a best selling author in a national radio educator I'm somebody that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now for almost a quarter century which is hard to believe\nThat we helped insulate their serious retirement savings so they sleep better worry less and have more to do what they want when they want how they want by just having a plant but a complete plan that addresses taxes\nMarket risk inflation\nAnd obviously economic uncertainty will folks I don't think the the economy could be more uncertain than it is now but I've been saying that now for gosh the last you know ten plus years\nAnd it just seems to become more and more unstable but when I Want to talk about with with this particular client a Cindy and Jerry is this tends to be what we see a lot of and that's people saying you know we've never had a complete plan we've\nNever had somebody address how we can not just make the most but keep the most and for those of you that are business owners listening you know that's the name of the game is not what you make it's what you keep strategically obviously there's a lot that goes behind that but here was the here's the reality\nRight that the two greatest risks and flash concerns that boomers are sharing ironically are predictable right the markets obviously going to to have a loss we don't know it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and we know taxes are going to continue to be a big threat\nAnd it's very obvious why that's the case which we'll talk about and then let's start with taxes as I get into this case study of of a in this particular case of ... one\nIs in the past month roughly the longest running bull market in history which is now standing at about nine and a half years well here's the reality folks know bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday and we're already over nine and a half years into this one\nThe second longest Bull Run a now was the dot com right which was fueled back in the nineties which caused investors to lose eighty percent\nNow while there's no guarantee that a bull market will crash before its tenth birthday right we do know that historically the longest running bull markets go out not like in a in a in a small fashion they go out in a with a big bang right it's like a drop\nAnd it's a pretty significant drop especially for those that were heavily into tech stocks back in the tech boom and bust that lost literally about eighty percent of their their assets\nAnd experts who study behavioral finance which I thought this was interesting note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for for getting the lessons and pain of past\nCrashes right and the reality is is folks and we've seen this and I've seen this with my wealth architecture team now more than I've ever seen it is that people are woefully unprepared for this next crashing facts\nIf position themselves to be in a worse position\nFor another two thousand and eight to hit than the amount that they lost than in other words how little they they didn't realize 'til we ran a stress test of their retirement road there on of how actually exposed more so they are this time than they were the last time\nAnd they said well Chuck wait a second I we told her advisor we don't want that type of risk folks their risk is worse\nAnd that's exactly what we found unfortunately in this case was Cindy\nAnd Jerry I'm going to talk about in a moment but here I mean people all over 'em right I mean ... J. P. Morgan has a date set for the next financial crisis right that was a Fortune Magazine article\nI'm nervous to market meltdown is in full of unfolding as a top on the top hedge fund managers are on a CNBC interview Nobel Prize winner a Schiller sees bad times and stock market ahead CNBC\nOr the worst financial crisis of my lifetime\nA by Mr Rogers who is one of the longest a best track record a performance or in the in the investing world a\nAnyone's ever ever other than the great Peter Lynch lived up to is saying he he sees this to be the worst financial crisis of his lifetime and he sees that happening sooner rather than later and then even sadly the great Warren Buffett right his saying hey there there's going to be a major recession\nAnd he sees it sooner rather than later and it's going to have a devastating impact of a projection of fifty percent loss or more in fact buffets rule I think couldn't be more timely which is right be greedy\nWhen others are fearful but be fearful when others are greedy folks people are greedy I mean at this point there's more money on margin banks are bigger than the last time they failed\nBroker just have more money on Mars in the last time obviously the market crashed\nAnd the reality is we're facing a lot of other economic uncertainty around trade tariffs around mid term elections are all the way to the disgraceful Kavanaugh hearings that are just it's a new low for me in politics but everybody can form their own opinion\nAnd the reality is\nMost people are not prepared\nWell here's the good news you can be\nNow the second piece of this that has people concerned and causing heartburn is our taxes right and I want to teach you that you can retire your taxes right\nRight okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty thousand divided into two hundred thousand right well it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you can do it and about five years not counting getting raises not counting saving even more that's the most I Would want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself house payment from age thirty page sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay\nOkay great well\nGo ahead and get lazy and we did we might be a guy to do maybe I hadn't heard time and say maybe a little bit where\nIt's up to you if you're gonna go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do is zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment you and you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again pay yourself a house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you\nSound like they recreate your eyes\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah is with us from Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm\nSure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve mine good for you and\nYes and I'm Down to just wind which is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm I with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband than a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now and just continuing that men on payments or\nEven not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it yeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not reporting\nIt today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that any time\nAnd so what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just to mark what a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill 'cause they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than a thousand at that point okay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum ... and I would build up a you know a lump\nSum up three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing okay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what I'm I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took her a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit mhm [noise] and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me a several other options [noise]\nI'm from the other options for to take a fixed\nAnd they were the monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums are non you're alive and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um\nSo uh [laughter] the anytime you start waving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call those bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners were trends together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that I ... and you have a good you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart buster pros and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value we're down in value either one no no insurance huh backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was one of your home at Seventy years old or\nSomething like a growth in income fonder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm you at Seventy and um and they wouldn't

the uh old crush corporal midtown title is going to look of knowledge here I'm going to say is it really depends on what price point you're looking at OK when the ... for the average consumer who's buying two hundred and fifty thousand or maybe less that let's just go less than three hundred thousand which is the average price in ... in Nashville\nThose houses I Do not see any ... out of reduction in price now\nDon because it's it's if anything is more competitive than ever because there's only so many of those houses available and with the right kind of kind of been a little balls are right now it's it's push people a lot more people into that project maybe if it's double that and as a six hundred thousand dollar house got maybe see a little more softening\nIn there and a one percent could be could be a drastic number depending on what the price of that houses\nBut it just I think a lot of it depends on what type of house you're looking at in where the houses located out so there's so many factors that go into that other than say in house prices are just softening\nYeah and and the one key thing to take out of all of this is if you get sucked into an article or you're hearing something on the news if you don't hear the word depreciation\nIf you don't hear them actually say or read in the print depreciation\nThan house house buyers are not fall they're just trying to grab some attention freak you out draw un by saying oh houses house prices are soft and in our home values are are falling from yeah from one year to the next ... we we want to see\nThe housing market get and find its new nor because you keep on price and all these people out of the market when you have a six percent ... percent twelve percent appreciation right ear every year every year and people you got to have you got to have stuff everybody\nThat this means you just gotta be careful when you're reading these headlines that discuss home values I mean you know the headline the the writers are just ... sometimes or just confused they use wording softening are falling and you know it just it's the headline grabbing at that point in time and it just made for you to\nClick on that little ... can read their article about do you draw you in to\nDo that so it's such a broad topic\nTo do that but I I you know I still don't see that you know maybe your house won't have Seventy five offers in the first three minutes it's on the market okay but it's it's just the reality of what it is and the reality is it depends on the house the location location location location there's so many factors again to\nThem so I wanted to touch touch and then it started to show up for that because we've been seeing and hearing\nAll this stuff about home prices softening of fallen and and people are starting to ask some questions about it so don't don't freak out over that listen to what they're saying read the article and if you don't see the depreciation in there than just chalk it up as headline grabbing and\nMove on your ... your friends that are like hypochondriacs as I can think the\nThe guy or they don't get sick but they think about it I can get sick that's what this does man this this gets people thinking that there's a problem and a lotta when there is not all of a sudden that could be a problem you know and it's just crazy that people talk themselves into this by reading stuff like this I don't\nTo do it in the fall Thirteen which is the ... and nothing with it [laughter]\nHey we'll come back from the break we're going to get into the\nReal estate market is really finding its new norm in that really kinda\n... we just were talking about with the\nDolphin in the real estate prices the appreciation not going up at the record levels anymore so we're talking about what the real estate market new norm is for some catches on the back side of this a of a break we're going to ... even when I'm In my show here on TALK radio Ninety\nEight point three and\nGet some ten WINZ we'll be right back\n\nBack to the money in my show here on TALK radio not have Winfrey and Fifteen ... the whole thing with the host Michel fair and in Studio ... mistress were voted\nDown title and we want to jump into this subject at that time and we can get way off in the weeds with this one but [noise]\nHas the real estate market finally found its new norm or is it trying to get back to new norm and then it begs the question is what's\nHouse overnight [noise] well I Do a lot of new construction work and I work with a lot of build her do a lot of development loans closings and you know it's a minimum two years to get a raw piece it yet or\nThrough planning and zoning or to get the\nLoans done the infrastructure in place and do what's the point where people would start going vertical on properties and there's no cost for materials and labor in and so yes there are more houses more houses coming online in a more a lot coming online they may not be in the price point\nThat the the biggest need is correct or at at this point in time but there is more houses\nCome on wind hopefully that's going to create a little bit of ... and the markets to free up some of these houses to allow people to move up a little bit in and take advantage of the new construction\nAnd and let me add one thing they're the ...\nYou know builders just don't go out and say okay hey look we know we can get four hundred grand for this house let's we're going to set of that\nThey have the same supply and demand issues going on with the role dirt and what they could buy an acre for or you know fifty acres for five years ago versus ten years ago versus today has dramatically changed so their their basis of what they've got into property\nYou know almost dictate in some regards what they what kind of house they've got to be able to build on that house I'm not rural piece of land and or even turn a profit on it\nYou have you have a fifty thousand dollar lot\nAnd that's a ... a sheep sheep yeah you can't build a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar house it's just not there to be able to do that and make any money right I mean you have to build a twenty five thirty hundred thousand dollar house which means a lot is worth more than a house yes so you can't do that\nEither and so as these ... as the land prices increase there's land for sale you can buy it in a lot of money for it to all that does is just to be taken up the primary houses I think about a whole lot price and you need to factor probably four times that by the time you get done building the house\nCosts was materials profits commissions ever again it goes on to that so if you\nHad a hundred thousand dollar law you need to be thinking you're probably going to spend five hundred thousand dollars on the house because it's going to take four hundred thousand dollars to to build the ... to be able to do to build something that's a good that that law price can carry so it's\nIt's a vicious vicious vicious cycle and and and that's why you're seeing more multifamily properties that are out there and that's kind of the new starter home are these multifamily properties that are out there the town homes\nCondominiums tone skinny tall and skinny or even as I've gotten really expensive but there's you know it's just\nTrying to find a way to get the house where there's less house or to make it more affordable for folks there by I've got ... I got it goes into the books bonding Clarksville they're buying and further and further and further and further out due out because that's what's going to can afford\nYeah yeah and you know it's it's\nThe bring his back you know full circle with this you know find the new normal\nAnd I don't think we're there um I think it's going to be in my personal opinion a couple more years before we really get there and okay we've settled into it\nAnd you know think of it kind of like when you're you're driving down interstate and you're doing eighty five miles an hour and a sixty sixty miles per hour speed limit and all of a sudden you ... you know you run a cop what do you do\nYou still have the break the break\nThem and and now you're crawling at sixty miles an hour or what feels like you're crawling they're mad about it yeah and you're upset about it so that's a kind of the same thing that we're we're seeing are starting to go through right now with the market is we've been appreciating and values and everything to me just go on at such a crazy insane\nPace and now they're starting to come down a little bit trying to find that norm and at the same time\nIf it was a little weird a little crazy like we're\nJust just hanging out with the market funded through norm and everything will find it [noise]\nGround and pan out again I Would say that\nWe got another break and we get back we're going to get into should you buy this year\nIf you're in a market for\nYou when you're looking\nFor the money man might show here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen tend to see that [noise]\n\n[noise] hey look back to the money man my show here on TALK radio ... point three in the end of the ... thing really realistic [noise] I'm your host Michel fair and under the surface ... titles opponent\nAnd [noise] you know somebody's out\nThey're debating on whether or not they're going to die or move off or you know just just get into the game of buying a house regardless of why they're doing it\nThey're kicking around the idea or they I Know some of them are kicking around the idea should should I buy now\nOr wait and\nA lot of people you know it's it's about everything that we've been talking about what today she'll already of what are you hearing in the market what'd you here in in the news what you're seeing on line and you're seeing these headline buddy talks about yeah and it's like should I or should I not you know and there's even some some uh\nA national correspondence put out things that talk about you should just rent and that ... the best way to go and it's like\nYou know what I tell people you know what I say to people who who talk about that you're kind of ... ... exactly I thought somebody that on friday I was like you're ... you're paying about ... find somebody else's house\nSo whether you rent or buy your pie is now the only the houses not for everybody always say that they are that's true you know you have to be in a spot where you're where you're ready to own a house here you you have a secure job if you have an ability to repay the loan\nYou are mentally ready to own a house yet but or or what ever there's a lot of factors that go into that but it's all those boxes are checked\nYou do you think house is going to get cheaper I mean I guess at some point down they could like the like the recession that we went through but I mean I don't know that I'm willing to even risk risks\nAnd even that we've covered that on you know when there was a bunch of ... going on and what was the eighth or ninth on the list of upcoming factors to the ... that there is that you did twenty twenty recession real estate was eighth or ninth analyst\nYeah it was multiple other factors like yeah it was eight other trigger point yeah it was like there is monetary policy there was the trade war I mean there's all sorts of this stuff going on there that political uncertainty yeah yeah and\nThe tariffs and just a lot of stuff that went on but real estate was was ... yeah\nBut yeah people are waiting to think that it's going to get better I I just don't see it get out any better you listen to all with the that are reserved doing in the monetary policy that are happening\nIt was very pro real estate president in office right now but that doesn't seem to matter as the economy is the steaming hot policy makers are trying to slow it down\nFirst of all the inflation down in the growth so they're doing that by raising interest rates\nAnd and Google this ... right now you can right now but Google a\nFederal Reserve reduces balance sheet\nAgainst Federal Reserve reduces balance sheet and if you're driving your car and you can't do it right now than that's completely understandable\nCheck us out online at

the the fed has bought four trillion over four trillion with the tea in bonds and that's what has artificially kept rates low and the point of telling you this is\nThe fed announced back in October of
