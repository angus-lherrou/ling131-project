[noise]\nEat the gas ... [noise] and regret the gas station ... as you presented numbers to the board\n[noise] to add\nInsult to injury you could've used those Fifteen ... minutes which your motorcycle insurance the going go [noise] of a\nWho's the minutes good say fifty percent\nFolks reality as it\nGets tying it into a comprehensive plan right it's not just what you make as we've all heard right it's what you keep in in in learning in in teaching and seeing and having a real life experience\nWith what it means to be self employed and pay taxes on taxes and seeing a unfortunately people that are more in the accounting area of taxation not the tax savings area of taxation it's kind of a rigged game to be quite candid\nAnd the reality is ... you've got to become informed in order to benefit the most\nAnd you know even when we look at what was a a book out called the ... golden rules of retiring rich one of the main goals are one of the main rules I should say was the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam to too much of their money in other words\nRight they understand that being informed legally ethically morally to reduce your taxes is perfectly allowed\nIt's just the government has a tax plan for you if you don't have a tax plan for yourself\nAnd when you think about this that the deficit ride the treasury just reported that the deficit\nFor fiscal year twenty team ... over seven hundred and eighty billion its up Seventeen percent\nRight now what kind of a ... year about that right when you really think about it is that in the end unusual jumped in a year which unemployment hit a five decades low right that the economy experienced a significant expansion\nRight but the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law late last year have reduced federal revenues considerably even against the backdrop of the booming economies to think about it in an economy that just booming and similar view is shared that Ryan and we've been blessed to have this booming economy the reality is\nTaxes are unfortunately going to have to be collected more heavily because the revenues are falling they're falling because more people retiring so they're not consuming as much because now they're conserving\nBut also the fact that we've had these tax cuts on top of ten thousand people retiring a day\nAnd on Monday This past week the treasury reported that revenues acts that were predicted to be three point five three trillion were only three point three three trillion\nWhich is a two hundred billion dollar shortfall in guess folks where they're going to collect that shortfall\nYeah they're going to click the shortfall from the people that have worked the hardest to save the hardest are going to get tax the hardest right\nAnd the tax that the cost the boomers can avoid that's costing them the most or will cost them the most\nIs taxation and the irony is the area that's causing people to most gets the least amount of attention until tax day rolls around so I Want to give a battle cry a shot across the bow of the importance\nOf thinking about taxes before the end of that President tax year right so what you can do to save tax has to be done and twenty teen if you want to save taxing twenty Eighteen\nAnd here's the reality the tax sale that's on with this new tax reform bill is only going to run through twenty twenty five\nSo to take advantage of each and every year Eighteen being the first year to take advantage of this this tax sale is vital you see a couple of people has learned that over the next years they can completely untaxed their IRAs which means they won't have any require minimum distribution\nWhich means they won't leave a tax burden to their kids but they also leave a tax burden to themselves while they're living because they won't subject\nHaving eighty five percent of their Social Security tax or that the require distribution other IRAs is so large that forces there Medicare part B indie premiums to be increased by three four hundred dollars per month each\nFolks we see it all the time I I see people that are paying more tax in their eighties the tax they paid in their highest wage earning years right leading up to the year that they retired when they would have been their highest wage earning near their taxes are higher Twenty years later\nFolks that doesn't need to be that way the question is are you ready for your twenty teens tax\nAnd do you have a plan that better than the government's tax plan for you right I think of a Marty and Debbie right they used one of our hidden well tax savings strategies that actually enabled them to zero their income tax out for twenty team and it's already done\nOr done and Steve sold a highly appreciate it asset that was exposing them to a massive capital gain cost in legally eliminated\nThe capital gains I think is mark and Donna right that ... they legally untaxed their IRAs in other words the ... the IRS is out of their IRAs\nThere isn't any concern about their you know distribution of their IRAs pushing them into a higher tax bracket or forcing eighty five percent of their Social Security to now be subject to tax [noise]\nAnd I think about Mick a mic is older and it was already retired but his requirement of distribution was just annihilate in his taxes was pushing him into a higher tax bracket and we completely got rid of his requirement on distribution so whether those of you listening or trying to get to retirement\nAnd it's all about how you can reduce your your earned taxable income or you're somebody that's already in retirement and you're drawing money out of your hard earned savings of these tax deferred accounts\nOr some of the even listening that have hit the milestone age of Seventeen and a half or

they retire\nAccording to marketwatch to improve their future right client should not assume that they're going to move into a lower tax bracket and they should avoid ending up being forced to have a high or large required distribution because that sets off a triggering of other forms of taxation\nRight and when you have more money in your pocket and let's go into the government folks that money

lump sum pension option from the employer or the pay out of the monthly payment\nFrom the employer you see if he elected the payout from the employer for the rest of his wife and his wife's Social

opportunities and wealth ... areas that others mess in essence helping people discovered uncovered there she hadn't wealth through our proven process the hidden wealth\nSolution and I want to share with you the two biggest boomer concerns that end up becoming the two biggest boomer retirement success techniques [noise]\nIn fact it really comes down to the reality of this there are two types of taxpayers and there are two types of retirement accounts\nSo let's get into this boomers two biggest concerns and I'm going to start with number one is having especially in light of what just happened a stock market protection plan\nC my my story is simple on them or talk to you how to get a complementary copy of my most recent book the baby boomer retirement breakthrough [noise] where I teach you my story see I was a I was somebody that got greedy as a buffet would say be greedy when others are fearful but cheerful and others are greedy and I I'm mixed that equation up\nAnd ended up being a victim of the tech boom and bust the last time the tech bubble hit and unfortunately people lost on average eighty percent on the NASDAQ being heavily into tech mutual funds or stocks\nAnd what I learned from that experience all that many years ago was that I always had the proper financial foundation for our family in structures that really only the ultra wealthy had ever really heard about\nBecause I became a student of finding a superior alternative\nThan just following the crowd you see and that's the concern today because if we look at what's happening history is likely repeating itself especially being this far into this next bull or what some people are arguing to be the longest Bull Run in stock market\nHistory in fact uh the headlines say at All right the markets fear index just exploded upwards of stocks around the world plummeted that was Business Insider\nBecause volatility is returning to the stock market in a big way back yesterday's a drop in the Dow eight hundred and thirty one points was the fourth largest single they drop in the Dow Jones stock market history\nAnd one of the things that that we track called the VIX or the ... volatility index see it's more than doubled in the past week and it's added another six percent as of just this most recent end of week and the fears of a major mark\nThe correction came to the forefront and I hopefully as many of your sharing a I've shared it again not just a best selling author or radio educator or or wealth architect I'm somebody that personally takes on clients and have now for almost a quarter century\nAnd this has been a continual theme right people got hammered in two thousand one and two that got hammered again in two thousand eight and early two thousand nine and many people are shared look we we don't have time to recover so if you're somebody listening that saved at least\nYou know two hundred thousand or more towards retirement and typically I'm Talking to those of you that are baby boomers so that could range anywhere from ages you know forty a five per se to Seventy five\nYou can protect yourself and it's not just\nTaking a a simple way to ... you know get inferior results it's actually using a more secure way to get superior results which I'll teach you you see the volatility index reflects the expectations of the volatility of the S. and P. five hundred that's the\nGold standard of what all of the wall street money managers aspire to get as close to in performance but long term none of them ever have\nThat is what we call investing and there is a distinct difference between investing and indexing and I'm not talking predominantly about in indexing type of an annuity some people confused that\nThese are techniques that the ultra wealthy of used for years that I was fortunate to learn almost Twenty years ago and applied for my own family that has saved our bacon\nAnd the safe so many other clients that we felt now for over these period of years and the time is upon us folks are the key is not being too little too late because many people unfortunately will have time to recover\nSee or CNBC came out there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts watching the charts right with the u._s. stock market in the midst of an October sell off some Wall Street topped chart watchers are worried the situation could only get worse\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go a the a warning for boomers this was out of NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash\nAnd sadly Fox News reported that both Amazon and Facebook just on this past Wednesday plummeted\nYou can do it and it just takes a little bit of planning it takes a lot of planning that takes finding the right people and takes looking at your numbers and bill we before the show started mark and I had sat down and talked to ...\nAbout nine different things you wanted to cover I think we've covered three so we still have other stuff that Governor but you know when it comes to our process and how it works yes you cannot call and just say some of your lifestyle maximize er which\nIf you're talking to your be your friends and neighbors and they say hey I'm going to get this lifestyle maximize or it may not make sense to them 'cause that's something we created it's customized and it's cost them to the person that comes in so when somebody calls and they set up an appointment and and and what happens is\nCaramel send out just a little bit of a homework sheep that it's two pages for us to help gather some information about you so you you feel that information out and you come in you sit down\nIn the first meeting in our our meeting process is typically three or four meetings so some people want to race through it and get it done I've discovered over the years that if you rushed the process typically a lot of questions come back later and then it creates uneasiness and security and I don't want to do that so I Want to make sure that\nWe set the expectation correctly everything is step by step and it's a process and what that means that you come in for the first meeting we sit down we talk about what some of your goals are what some of your aspirations are I'm going to ask you what you're trying to achieve and when you want to achieve it\nAnd so I I often say there's an emotional side of that meeting and then there's a financial earth you know a a a number side of it so we're going to talk about some of the stuff you'd like to do what's important to you when you're trying to achieve but then we're also going to talk about where do you have some air assets I'm not going to look at your statements I'm going to ask you to bring them in just in case we go to the next step\nSo the next step is you know so let's say we get done with this hour meeting and we both mutually agreed that it makes sense to go to the next step\nAnd that is the only question you'll ever ask me or hear me ask you the question is going to be what would you like me to do next and that's it so this is not a sales job this is not very upset and you're going to get trapped in my office you never going to leave no\nIt's an interview I'm interviewing you and you're interviewing me and if it makes sense to after that first hour to go to the next step then we go on if it doesn't we part ways knowing that we had a nice cup of coffee we enjoyed our camaraderie we enjoyed helping in talking to each other but that's all that it was in that is a a oh okay\nBut if you say I want to go to the next step\nYou still do write a check you still don't spend any money what we do is we start to lay out our lifestyle maximize and this is where I Will take a look and I'll say okay\nLet's look at five key areas so let's make sure we talk about again goals and dreams but we also want to do this is me now taking all of your ah information to some of your statements\nAnd we do a thorough look at where everything is so without getting too deep into thick into the weeds basically what we're going to do is we're going to evaluate\nWhere everything is what are some of the pitfalls split or some of the things you're doing well and it it becomes a blueprint for the lifestyle maximize or this this next meeting is like the foundation\nOf what are the things that we want to achieve what's working and what's not working you come back in for another meeting this one has been again no charge doesn't cost you a thing as long as we're both feeling comfortable moving down the road we're on our way\nSo in the second leading takes about an hour I'm just going to lay out what I discovered very very educational\nYou know John I go back to my buddy that I was talking about that had unexpectedly had six bypass surgery and then the two days later he's got a nine hour spinal cord surgery\nAnd it's a long road there's no question but I can guarantee you that my money did not care how the heart surgeon was doing the surgery he\nWanted to know did he do the surgery and well and then when he went to the spinal cord surgeon obviously\nHey I Want to be able to walk again what in the world happen it's crazy it I'm going through this but I'm trusting that you're going to do what is in my best interests that is what how you operate in the financial world Europe for ... which means morally legally ethically obligated to do what is your client's best interest and\nI think that's really important as well because it's a two way street you know if I'm Talking to you about my retirement I'm the c._e._o. because it's my money is my retirement\nYou're the CFO the chief financial officer you do this every day you understand what decisions are good and water may be might be a little riskier and so it's about using your experience to help me come up with a plan\nFor me and my retirement\nYeah and then make sure 'cause people really what they want to know mark as they want to know okay\nCan I really trust John can I really have you know they can these goals really come true in we lay out and everything so will lay it out and show everybody how it's going to happen what the probability is you know your success rate some of the things we have to be aware of\nAnd what happens after these meetings you know and and then after we implement everything I Want to stress also it doesn't and\nSo this is not like we're doing this once and then I'll send you on your way and I'll see you later now\nWe're starting to begin a beautiful relationship\nAnd it won't happen just like any other relationship that you've been involved in it doesn't happen overnight it takes time you know small steps\nOver the course of a long period of time and then pretty soon you've got a great relationship and you know we put together a lot of a lot of different things that we do throughout the year to help foster that relationship because\nMy goal is to a first of all make sure that you could live the life you want to live\nSecondly I Want to create a community of hundreds successful people a hundred people who have [noise] you know a figure it out or started to look at what's important to them\nAnd then I Want to bring those people together throughout the year at different events in different dinners and we do fund functions and we'll do a\nYou know sometimes we'll do charity events together sometimes we'll do a you know small trip together sometimes ... will have dinner together will do educational presentations to make sure you always know what's happening but I Want you to come together and meet my other people I'm very very protective of my people\nAnd the culture and when I talk about my culture I'm Talking about creating a great environment of great people and helping them discover what they want to do introduce you to each other and you guys will create a great community and and have\nNetwork of folks that used to be your work environment but it is now your retirement environment and instead of going to work and punching the clock you're going and doing great stuff whether you're camping you're traveling you're going to grandkids ball games you're seeing the kids at the grand kids you're doing the stuff that you love to do and that's what creates a great life\nIt's not going to happen by accident happens on purpose it happens but you taking the step and saying I'm going to call six one five six five six\nZero zero nine nine I'm going to take the first step I don't know if I'm going to take the second step [noise] but I'm going to take the first step and make that phone call [laughter] so when you call will set up a time it'll be as mark and mentioned when we started the show in case you're just joining us he called it a fireside chat [laughter]\nBut I Will be dressed I won't have a tie on but I Will be dressed so [laughter] I don't work [laughter]\n'cause

our process if it makes sense we go to the second step if it doesn't [noise]\nThat's all we invested so again the phone number is six one five six five six zero zero nine nine\nOur goal for you to help you create the life you want to live\n[noise] single copy of your world go half golden we don't have to be trapped in this box or in what America thinks that we should do we can go do what you

next week for\nRetirement inside what John naval John navy and associate [noise]\nInvestment advisory services\nIt happens on new construction and a lot where people threw feel that they don't have to have an inspection down on a new house there because there isn't the praise or or if it or whatever else and so kind of have to go into a ... explain that one thing I ...\nYeah so you were going to have it's a new building or an existing build a house I should say you want to ...\nI mean there's very few times I can think of where you would not want one but I mean you want to know what's right or wrong and that property and ... we've said before 'cause we talked about homosexuals before on the show um you're homosexual reports ... gonna be ten twelve could be as many as twenty something pages long\nAnd they're typically coated in red light green light yellow light\nIn your home inspector feels like they've got to do a good job for you and they do and they show you all the stuff that's wrong with the house but the majority of the stuff\nIs like maintenance thing that you can do stuff [noise] so I got a question for you yeah you're\nBuying a house as is do you get home inspection absolutely and then why is it important to have a home inspection if you're buying a house as is to make sure there's no\nSense it makes you not want to buy it or yeah but you're buying it as is so it's not the light your age is ... it up to say after my inspection period I'll accept it as a protecting\nYour interest you're right you're angle she works for you not to sell it to second what I mean the cell that might be trying to slide something under the table\nRight it doesn't preclude your choice of having a home in the exact legs I said you either have to buy it as it's that they're not\n... that's the people you're even you know to surround yourself with and the business I mean if I'm selling a house that somebody I'd never going to say I'll you know they'd home inspection now that is not going to come out of my mouth ever\nKnow you always want to home inspection its its insurance you pay for it all the time whether it's car insurance life insurance homeowner's insurance you pay for insurance but the day you need it you want it and that's the way I view homeowners and it's a homo home inspection is like insurance you almost\n... almost like appraisals I think sometimes when you get ten home inspectors out there I think you're going to a different value above what\nThe subject for it to you know yet how do you choose a good one than well I mean there's I don't ever get just one guy I give you like unless it's ... you know ... you know people have you know that I feel are ... um I trustworthy and have their integrity right you know the correct credential\nThan ever been up there when they're home inspect it\nSure yeah a guy and so you kind of walking around making sure they're actually looking\nFor the summary and kind of let them walk through with the buyers and the educated on everything a lot of good things about the home inspection other than just what's wrong with the house is\nWhere's your you know where's your stuff where's your water chef things you need to know if something goes wrong that otherwise you may not know that I mean some people are more savvy than others or you know the home and ... improvement and what not and some people have no clue so\nThat's it's interesting you brought that up because I mean how many people really know where they're shut off of his\n... all that it happens all the time\nAnd then as soon as the moment comes up that you need to find it you have no clue where it's at\nAnd you know what I mean looking back at all or is it that I had somebody call me the other day right when they turn their heat on which I'm sure that's happened all over but they're like or he's not working downstairs and now I'm like looking in their home and sex and okay it's gas did you turn on your God yeah but yeah I mean we figured it out but I bet a lot of agents got called when I got called\nIt it is something that gets overlooked but yet the people discredit or think it's not no big deal but I mean\nIt's worth the extra four hundred and forty bucks whatever you're being charged for your home inspection and um [noise] I wouldn't do buy a home without it so [laughter] hey we've got a job out to a break but uh [noise] we're going to get into some very interesting topics today and one is are we shifting from a seller's market to a buyer's market\nA lot of things are said about that a lot of people don't really understand what the differences between the two so\nWe're not jumping to that and kind of put that the bed and then also talk about some more slowing down\nFollowing appreciating what the market so [noise]\nYou see [noise]\nHey looking back to the money and my show here on TALK right on that point three in the end of the movies of all things out there and in Studio we have Chris Mr Chris for both from uh midtown title and then ... brewer from benchmark Ruthie and [noise] what does [noise]\nWhat's the sellers are buyer's market mean [noise] I mean that gets them around the media so many times people hear about all the time a nightly news and it's like a facility markets a buyer's market what what what defines a seller's a buyer's market\n[noise] well it means that it's favored to the or the defendant on which side you're on them and we are somewhat in a seller's market but I think that is slightly shifting right now just a little bit I'm\nBack in just definition ... a seller's market would be when you're selling the house and the seller has the advantage over the buyer or vice versa\nAnd a lot of that stems back to the days I'm not today's market but the the inventory and ... National Association of real tours a show right now the current running a editorial four point three and a national level\nA moving on\nMan talking about an odd day drive forty five minutes or [laughter] you know easy [laughter]\nSo what do we decide here what do you know just elderly market ... is the sky Arlen Ehlers market seller's best to general consensus yet and think\nAbout it this way man you use the analogy that we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show you're on the interstate highway whatever you call and use them and Dana eighty five miles an hour and you're just getting it and all of a sudden you roll up on a cop and you look at the speed limit and you're like oh crap and twenty miles over you go back down to sixty five\nAnd now all of a sudden you feel like you're crawling along things are going by their ... only ...\nRight right so we've just slow down a little bit in our appreciation yeah you know and and the market itself is called opposite attacks it's still a very healthy and positive market it's just slowed down some I don't look at it like it some\nYou know me but just barely move in that you can't even measure and you think of the world's fall in the sky fault\nI Would also like to point out I have multiple listings about they hit the market and every one of them I say well is this the bad times now now I'm like you know I mean typically you know spring and summer when everyone thinks now than that I mean and that is the busiest time of the year of selling the house but\nThe life goes on people still get transferred to eat out things still go on the difference is now and those people in the market if you're in the market to buy or sell you motivated they're trying to find out how to sell your house\nWe always talk about on the holidays you know it's a great time to lift your house even though people say it's not as big right who are in the market there there are areas you're not down just messing around them right in there out seriously trying to look at properties so that's I mean I read an offer like on Christmas Day last\nYear and you think about it I mean you hear about all these companies to relocate in the Nashville there's been tons of things on like the social media sites like linked in and so forth a hundred people a day and when you're being transferred in you don't exactly get to choose when you get transferred in I Will get transferred to Nashville year around so\nYou don't hear many people getting transferred out to know that kind of get here and stay don't that that's kind of the draw Nashville man so\nThey'd have somebody relocating actually out of here out of here but they get like an opportunity on the last time when their job and they're going to get city now [laughter] telecommute they're going to a smaller town ... they're getting to open their own branch is when they ...\nMight not be able to buy or sell a house that's rather Petra okay hey we got about another break when we get back we're going to talk about a mortgage insurance and why I had preached in preached in preached in preached about you don't\nWant mortgage insurance but now you might want that's on the other side from the break even look someone in my show here on TALK radio not here for three and Fifteen tend to see\n\nThat means that W L E the forecast enclosed weekend mostly clear it's got to separate your loaded forty\nNice looking started work week sunshine on Monday the weapons to the dentist ... ... where our Monday nights on nuclear guys forty five of the overnight ... head of the storms on Wednesday and that next to them it's going to be warm on Tuesday mostly sunny\nAnd the Web or seven hour by the ... group I'm Jeff veto with the weather channel the out on the half dozen men\n\nWalking back to the money man my show here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen N. W. I. C. we took all the reality shows they're [noise] and we have a studio Chris ... from ... I don't and then ... and\nA jump into the conversation I Want to touch on one thing that I forgot to say in our last segment\nUm homes and the equity within the homes [noise] um [noise] ...\n... your your your equity is basically the the the ratio or the balance between the number of leans or the amount of links you have in your house so if you have a hundred thousand dollar mortgage\nAnd your house is worth two hundred thousand dollars then basically you got to ... percent ratio ... percent of ... is equity in the ... percent on the property value\nWell there's Thirteen point nine million properties in the U.S as a cue to court to of two thousand Eighteen that fit that model that fit that hit that benchmark ... percent fifty percent equity\nOr the other for trillions of dollars and equity in the U.S that people\nYeah and people don't realize how much equity they have sitting in their homes oh yeah I mean time I had time parts of the town\nWhere it I mean like oh yeah I can count hundreds of them\nYeah so that's our lack of him indoors because people don't want to sell their homes or they don't want us to go ... and all that money on a new house and they're just going to sit and put so yes\nSo as you say that to set up one thing that is and my\nIf you're still paying him my mortgage insurance ... to refinance\nAnd if you're worried about the costs of refinancing we can position you're skipped two months' payments cover your costs to refinance and put you back where you punch balance was before the ... and now you're ... you're in my and if you keep on paying what you're paying right now you're going to pay off the house off even faster\nMhm what would people not\nDon't know just going to sound really bad I'm so sorry I'm so sorry everybody fire people ... would you not ... I mean I guess people just don't know that they can get that off of there at that point a threat didn't that fifty percent loan to value wouldn't I mean because the first thing come to my mind is I'm so sick of paying this stuff why can't I get it when can I get it off my loans when I'm paid anymore", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement and Income Radio", "city": "Nashville", "day": "28"}
