means to be self employed and pay taxes on taxes and seeing a unfortunately people that are more in the accounting area of taxation not the tax savings area of taxation it's kind of a rigged game to be quite candid\nAnd the reality is ... you've got to become informed in order to benefit the most\nAnd you know even when we look at what was a a book out called the ... golden rules are retiring rich one of the main goals are one of the main rules I should say was the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam to too much of their money in other words\nRight they understand that being informed legally ethically morally to reduce your taxes\nIs perfectly allowed it's just the government has a tax plan for you if you don't have a tax plan for yourself and when you think about this that the deficit ride the treasury just reported that the deficit\nFor fiscal year twenty team ... over seven hundred and eighty billion it's a Seventeen percent\nRight now what kind of peculiar about that right when you really think about it is that in in the end unusual jumped in a year which unemployment hit a five decades low right that the economy experienced a significant expansion\nRight but the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law late last year have reduced federal revenues considerably even against the backdrop of the booming economies to think about it in an economy that just booming and similar view is shared that ride and we've been blessed to have this booming economy the reality is\nTaxes are are are unfortunately going to have to be collected more heavily because the revenues are falling falling because more people retiring so they're not consuming as much because now they're conserving\nBut also the fact that we've had these tax cuts on top of ten thousand people retiring a day\nAnd on Monday This past week the treasury reported that revenues acts that were predicted to be three point five three trillion were only three point three three trillion\nWhich is a two hundred billion dollar shortfall in guess folks where they're going to collect that shortfall yeah they're going to click the shortfall from the people that have worked the hardest to save the hardest are going to get tax the hardest right and the tax that the cost\nThe boomers can avoid that's costing them the most or will costs and the most\nIs taxation and the irony is the area that's costing people the most gets the least amount of attention until tax day rolls around so I Want to give a battle cry a shot across the bow of the importance\nOf thinking about taxes before the end of that President tax year right so what you can do to save tax has to be done and twenty teen if you want to save taxing twenty Eighteen\nAnd here's the reality the tax sale that's on with this new tax reform bill is only going to run through twenty twenty five\nSo to take advantage of each and every year Eighteen being the first year to take advantage of this this tax sale is vital you see a couple of people has learned that over the next years they can completely untaxed their race which means they won't have any require minimum distribution\nWhich means they won't leave attacks burned to their kids but they also won't leave a tax burden to themselves while they're living because they won't subject\nHaving eighty five percent of their Social Security tax or that the require distribution other IRAs is so large that forces there Medicare part B indie premiums to be increased by three four hundred dollars per month each\nBooks we see it all the time I I see people that are paying more tax in their eighties then the tax they paid in their highest wage earning years right leading up to the year that they retired when they would have been their highest wage earning here their taxes are higher Twenty years later\nFolks that doesn't need to be that way the question is are you ready for your twenty teens tax\nAnd do you have a plan that's better than the government's tax plan for you right I think is a Marty and Debbie right they used one of our in well tax savings strategies that actually enabled them to zero their income tax out for twenty team and it's already done\nOr done and Steve sold a highly appreciated asset that was exposing them to a massive capital gain cost in legally eliminated\nThe capital gains I think of mark and Donna right that they legally untaxed their IRAs in other words the governor the iris is out of their IRAs\nThere isn't any concern about their you know distribution of their IRAs pushing them into a higher tax bracket or forcing eighty five percent of their Social Security to now be subject to tax [noise] and I think about Mick a mic is older\nAnd it was already retired but his requirement of distribution was just annihilate in his taxes was pushing him into a higher tax bracket and we completely got rid of his requirement on distribution so whether those of you listening or trying to get to retirement\nAnd it's all about how you can reduce your your earned taxable income or you're somebody that's already in retirement and you're drawing money out of your hard earned savings of these tax deferred accounts\nOr some of the even listening to hit the milestone age of seven and a half or the government then forces you to take these distributions the good news is folks you can save tax but you've got to act and here's the opportunity\nFor those of you listening that saved and have concerns have your taxes this year they have a couple of hundred thousand or more [noise] wonder ... maybe your business owner or you're a baby boomer ... or maybe you're just somebody wants to see how much on this area tax you can cut out of the equation so you have a better tax plan and the government [noise] here's what I like for those of us that have a genuine interest to do\nEmail taxes saved right to excuse me help at taxes saved dot com that's held at

hidden wealth radio\nIs Charles Oliver welcome to hitting Welles radio\nYou're just joining us all of our radio shows are archived at hidden wealth radio dot com\n[noise] what we've been talking about taxes and here's why that's so important the window to still save tax is still open but folks has closing very very quickly because what you do in twenty Eighteen has to be implemented in twenty team\nFor you to save tax in twenty teens and the reality is this the tax sale that we have with this new tax reform bill as great as it is is causing a lot of problems in his ultimately causing people more tax which I'll teach you\nBut the tax sales only good through twenty twenty five\nAnd then it goes away\nSo the time to act as now right like any sale you want to take advantage of sale before the sale expires well every year\nLeading up through the end of twenty twenty five is the opportunity to reduce your taxes the most because what you do this year ... dramatic impact\nOf how much less tax you pay for this year and next year forward fact we've been talking about an article that was out that this rather alarming and I see this again I I'm not just a best selling author or\nNational radio educator I'm somebody that works with clients individually baby boomers and business owners and have now for over Twenty years\nAnd the number one trap for those that have worked the hardest to save the hardest and ultimately and accounts that haven't been taxed yet like for one case in IRAs right those we listening is aides say two three four five hundred thousand or more in retirement accounts\nYou become what I call them my books is that found through my experience the perfect taxpayer because unfortunately the government has had better tax plan for you than you have for them [noise]\nAnd I think a former federal judge by the name of learned hand said it best you said you know in America there to tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both are legal\nThe stakes ahead of the next year right or head of retirement even goes on to say to validate seniors are likely to pay unnecessary taxes in retirement if they fail to avoid making financial mistakes before they retire\nAccording to marketwatch to improve their future right clients should not assume that they're going to move into a lower tax bracket and they should avoid ending up being forced to have a high or large required distribution because that sets off a triggering of other forms of taxation\nRight and when you have more money in your pocket and let's go into the government folks that's money for you to use for your grandchildren for your travels to visit and do the things you can do while you're still allows you to do them\nAnd don't forget what judge hands said right because it's true and I've seen it I I'm somebody that you're listening to that for years overpaid unnecessary taxes and then got super serious\nAbout learning what the ultra wealthy do and what the tax savvy due to pay my legal least required amount share and unpatriotic folks I have no problem paying tax I just have a problem paying tax not required to pay and he said it best you said you know in America there to tax systems one for the informed one for the uninformed but both are legal\nFolks get informed here's the opportunity [noise]\nI'm going to give those of you that are very curious to say how much tax in my overpaying or how much unnecessary tax can I be avoiding and especially for those of you that are likely predicting your taxes are going to be higher\nIn twenty anti maybe you sold highly appreciated asset\nOr maybe you you this was the first year you had your required minimum distribution maybe some of you this is the first year you elected your Social Security maybe that's some of you ... have not requested or locked in your\nApplication or choice excuse me of election of Social Security because you may find that you can prevent that Social Security from being taxed like one of our clients we were able to show them how to avoid having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security tax and you know what it had everything to do\nWith whether he they were going to elect the lump sum pension option from the employer\nOr the pay out of the monthly payment from the employer you see if he elected the payout from the employer for the rest of his life he and his wife's Social Security eighty five percent of it would have been tax which would have given up anywhere from six to ten thousand a year of unnecessary taxes as the Social Security benefit continue to draw higher\nFolks simply email here's what we're doing um we're we're there's enough time but you have to act email help at taxes saved dot com that help\n... taxes saved dot com and put in your

opportunities and wealth ... areas that others mess in essence helping people discovered uncovered there she hadn't wealth through our proven process the hidden wealth\nSolution and I want to share with you that two biggest boomer concerns that ended up becoming the two biggest boomer retirement success techniques [noise]\nIn fact it really comes down to the reality of this there are two types of taxpayers and there are two types of retirement accounts\nSo let's get into this boomers two biggest concerns and I'm going to start with number one is having especially in light of what just happened a stock market protection plan\nC my my story is simple what am I talk to you how to get a complementary copy of my most recent book the baby boomer retirement breakthrough [noise] where I teach you my story see I was a I was somebody that got greedy as a buffer would say be greedy when others are fearful but fearful and others are greedy and I I'm mixed that equation up\nAnd ended up being a victim of the tech boom and bust the last time the tech bubble hit and unfortunately people lost on average eighty percent on the NASDAQ being heavily into tech mutual funds or stocks\nAnd what I learned from that experience all that many years ago was that I always had the proper financial foundation for our family and structures that really only the ultra wealthy had ever really heard about\nBecause I became a student of finding a superior alternative than just following the crowd you see and that's the concern today because\nIf we look at what's happening history is likely repeating itself especially being this far into this next bull or what some people are arguing to be the longest Bull Run in stock market\nHistory in fact are the headlines said All right the markets fear index just exploded upwards of stocks around the world plummeted that was Business Insider\nBecause volatility is returning to the stock market in a big way back yesterday's a drop in the Dow eight hundred and thirty one point was the fourth largest single they drop in the Dow Jones stock market history\nAnd one of the things that that we track called the VIX or the ... volatility index [noise] see it's more than doubled in the past week and it's added another six percent as of just this most recent end of week\nAnd the fears of a major market correction came to the forefront and I hopefully as many of your sharing a I've shared it again not just a best selling author or radio educator or or wealth architect I'm somebody that personally takes on clients and have now for almost a quarter century\nAnd this has been a continual theme right people got hammered in two thousand one or two that got hammered again in two thousand eight and early two thousand nine and many people are shared look we we don't have time to recover so if you're somebody listening that saved at least\nYou know two hundred thousand or more towards retirement and typically I'm Talking to those of you that are baby boomers so that could range anywhere from ages you know forty a five per se to Seventy five\nYou can protect yourself and it's not just\nTaking a a simple way to ... you know get inferior results it's actually using a more secure way to get superior results which I'll teach you you see the volatility index reflects the expectations of the volatility of the S. and P. five hundred that's the\nGold standard of what all of the wall street money managers aspire to get as close to\nAnd performance but long term none of them ever have\nThat's what we call investing and there's a distinct difference between investing in indexing and I'm not talking predominantly about in indexing type of an annuity some people confuse that these are techniques that the ultra wealthy of used for years that I was ...\nAnd it to learn almost Twenty years ago and have applied for my own family that has saved our bacon\nIn a safe so many other clients that we've helped now for over these period of years and the time is upon us folks are the key is not being too little too late\nBecause many people unfortunately will have time to recover see or CNBC came out there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts watching the charts right with the u._s. stock market in the midst of an October sell off some Wall Street topped chart watchers are worried the situation could only get worse\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go a the a warning for boomers this was out of NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash\nMhm take home pay take home mhm mhm\nAnd like I didn't know whether I got a debt no car payment what ...\nWhat does that kind of homework mhm\nAbout two hundred and twenty thousand\nEnemy we'd need about fifty thousand dollar amounts to her case the one that we are interested in\nSo you're moving from two hundred twenty two ... two hundred Seventy those are\nYeah it's not much of a move\n[noise] no it's not but it does have a lot more upgrade than what how how will now because they stayed with me we would have to invest money in the house to do the upgrade I'm already got quite a bit accomplished\nMhm or you could stay not do the birds we can stay in the way not do the courage all we can stand not pick up a new site and save money and\nMove with cash right\nThere's no way I Would go back into I mean you've gone out and the first thing to do is go get a house fever\n[noise] right and that's after hearing that ... that that stream that it gets hot on I thought I but I Know they have already\nYou know I mean you knew what you want to do I I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible it's a tiny little mortgages you said but I I just I just couldn't go back\nOnce this hard to get out I mean you you have a two hundred and twenty thousand are paid for home in Roanoke, Virginia that is not a buy a house that's all right great house as a matter of fact\nI'm well above average square footage and the United states in a great neighborhood by definition in the ... market that's what that houses so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you to do what I what Sharon and I would do\nWe we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us back in there is nothing I Want bad enough to go back into debt\nAnd there's a lot of stuff I'd like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish the only the money to do but I'm not quite dead for it even for a minute even for just a second 'cause my life is so good\nWithout any payments so you do what you want to do but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just make me throw up to think about it\nUm I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I say either you know piecemeal out of your income you know what I mean the payments you save up some money picks up the Algerian as you said some upgrades or if you want to move save up you know shape hard for a couple of years\nYou probably save up fifty grand two years without any payments if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out in pulsing riding around on a Sunday afternoon and solve this particular property while that one's not gonna be there\nOh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do I'm not going to be mad at you either way\nI just couldn't do it there's no way Ariana is with us in Canada I Ariana how are you\nI think if I can I call I think you have a family history thank you how can I help him along to plan like by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sister who I've my pennant I help\nUm found her own place how it's currently sitting on the the entire complex that it and has gone down in value from my unit is very Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm terrified of the units have the same dialing land is mine and I know a lower\nPrice added like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday a Himalayan it came on the market has been less than one hundred Ninety I asked him\nStarting to feel a bit of egg and Peter how because it sitting empty and when ... cutting no I was thinking of capital my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive got out of their pay six months way of condo feet\nGot anything out there with me and I would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket on the market is discharged\nAnd my question is how would you how much would you pay out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHobbies you'd have obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland I don't know what I'm going to judge the situation and\nHow quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and uh you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I Want to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um I Would I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't\nYou know so you know so in some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's so\nUh but the but the five thousand out of pocket to be done with those two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worst case Kelly and when the pay is not a place to move in the wintertime\nWell but I mean not only just this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worth three hundred thousand two years from now exactly is going the wrong way\nAnd so it's it's time to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right I I don't think you're panicking what the numbers you're giving me now if you start telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket what thirty grand I'm probably gonna wait the winter out you know\nMay put a tenant and wait all spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far\nBelow the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing good question I'm Sorry you're facing this open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five thanks for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I've now got over a million people on Instagram\nWow and I'm just now figuring out how to do it myself\nUm the guys at work here to do it and uh when I actually put a picture up there are people freak out so it doesn't it cause I'm not very good at it but um I got pretty good at Twitter but nobody's on Twitter Twitter bad except except a bunch of trolls\nI mean it's just a bunch of angry people that um don't have a real identity you know or whatever so Instagram nice people ... by and large not all but\nA block and one woman that was being a\nTest pilot from a broom factory the other day but um anyway Instagram Andrea by the end of the month will have four months of expenses saved\nDo we save up for a down payment on a home or do we start investing are both at the same time we'd love to buy by the end of next year\nI think it's fine to wait for one year the starch your baby step for we call that baby step three baby if you postpone your retirement savings for a short period of time to save up a big juicy fat down payment\nAnd if you can do that in a year and I think you can sounds like you've got this thing on the run you're out of debt you got your emergency fund dang dang you've done this the right way you move into the house to house is going to be a blessing not a curse it's going to be a\nDream not a nightmare show yeah save up till the end of year and then a buy a house next spring sometime in ... in storage or a or restart either one of your\nRetirement savings at that point\nAnd thanks for following us on Instagram Andrea way through shaded that puts this hour that Iran's you show in the books are they trials or producer Kelly Daniels our associate producer Springer I'm Dave Ramsey or hosted we will\nBe\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash show\nYou guys hear me say all the time that if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else I'm so excited to introduce our brand new book\nYup so a lot of people are moved up but not enough people actually pulled the trigger and make it happen to still supply the additional houses for other people that need to buy\nGifts with a combination of things between the the the slowness of new lots coming on the ground for builders to build a big one um so that's that's created that uh people having lower interest rates and not moving wanting to move at that point in time and this the pricing going up so we've been in like the perfect storm of uh\nOf chaos in our industry for a long period of time and and like I said that's what's causing a lot of the interest rates interest that housing prices to rise at that point in time is I mean is the fact that says a blind man\nIt's pure supply and demand so the point of this is the lead off the show is the don't be all worried about is there another housing bubble come in because we get that question all the time and it's we continue to have reports in data that comes out to suggest\nThere's not even close to a housing bubble happening so it's just pure supply and demand and there's a lot of very very smart economists that'll come out on record of making that same statement that this is pure supply and demand\nNatural process of the market and it won't stabilize or prices won't level off and start to retreat until you know the markets are stay of us will people hear the word recession\nAnd they automatically ... we went through you know ... the great depression\nWhich I get it you know I mean we're both in businesses that are tied to the real estate market so it does scare the heck\nOf a ... somebody to do that but you know a recession by definition is a slow enough economic times for a period of six months or more at that point in time\nSo recession doesn't mean the world's coming to an end it just means that there's going to be no growth and a slower period for for the ... at least six months or more at that point in time so I Know\nMost experts feel like that does to you know if we do have one it's going to be a way more moderate than yeah we had in the past and it's more of a correction in the market yeah as opposed to a recession at that point in time\nI totally agree totally agree [noise] and he had another one of those statistics that came out was um\nComing up [noise] let's see in the next twelve months and this is a again coming from North Steve a condom is Lawrence yum that basically they're going to be four times more renters\nPeople that are renting now there's gonna be four times more renters looking to buy\nHouses than the people that currently own houses are willing\nWilling to move so there's you've got let's see that ten people that are going to sell their house\nAs a seller but there's forty people forty renters in this situation holy cow that are looking to buy that house so a four to one ratio right now renters are looking to buy versus there are people willing to sell and that's going to play out over the next twelve months so that's going to continue to add to our current\nSupply and demand issue and continue to push prices up a massive number ... blew me away when I read it I was like holy cow [noise] but uh it was it was in a post that we put out on a\nJuly Eighteenth demand for house in a ... a demand for homes\nTo by demand for homes to buy continues to climb and they went through\nAnd looked at all in our numbers the inventory of home number everything and came up with that number and it's just insane totally and saying [noise] but a\nLittle bit enough apartments for people [laughter] I don't know if people can afford them or not but a off either way they're building departments every place you can think of any more\nI Know I Know hey we've got a job out to a break but we'll get back rent talking about the cost of living here in Nashville and where national rank or over the last twelve I'm off [laughter] it'll be a mind blowing number ...\nConversation I went back up in the next couple of weeks as well so it's been a somebody men might show here on TALK radio ... we'll be right back [noise]\nThe [noise]\nA welcome back to the money man my show here on TALK radio Fifteen ten WINZ when we talk all things real estate to [noise] um yeah Michael payers washed on mortgage and studio we have the Supreme Court vote from midtown title and\nA recent study was put out by the national Business Journal\nA med gardener um at the national journal published is on July eleventh two thousand Eighteen [noise]\nAnd the headline reads study Nashville has greatest cost of living increase in the U.S that your headline national has greatest cost of living in the u._s.\nHuh [laughter] that are as you well know not being in the market well I mean the the greatest would be probably a far fetched worked for me to understand but I mean I Know it's good\nAfter you meet somebody folks who live in these other states where where either insurance is high taxes are higher values are high people feel like they get a pretty good deal for who live here fear\nYou know credit profile their income profile or whatever these are the basic things that you need to know if everything you know just checks out as normal stuff you need to know or need to have some sort of down payment but in reality we're finance and people that hundred percent financing as well so if you qualify for a hundred percent financing\nGreat but generally plan on between five\nTo ten percent of the purchase price and in today's market many buyers are putting down less than ten percent with a lot of and put her down less than three percent so there's a lot of ways to get around it but we always like to say plan for it 'cause there's so many more options that open up to you when you have a little money to play with\nWhereas the programs that will do a hundred percent financing their little more limited they're little they're more limited on what they'll\nAllow you to do and we can get very creative and a good way to help reduce your mortgage payment when you have a little cash cash to work with [noise]\nAnother thing is income verification credit history an asset documentation\nNow to me this is the biggest category because\nYour credit is what your your credit as much credit is and a lot of people think you've got to have a seven hundred or some forty or eight hundred score truth of the matter is as long as you're somewhere around six hundred plus you're good even if you're in the five\nDepending on what's going on you still might be able to make everything work I mean we can do things with a lot of five hundred scores that most companies can't but the same time you're going to have more questions lawyer score is just expect\nMore questions the higher score is you're going to have the fewest amount of questions so it's a good score and that's a loaded question uh from the you knew\nThat from a lemonade stand point there seven years yeah or credit approval number was the\nThe basic marked at all the all the adjustments to your rate um are predicated on is a seven forty\nAnd to me that's a very high benchmark and that's where all the conventional loans will stop possession you any kind of\nAdjustment because of ... or credit or am I mean it's a complex conversation to have it up and show you some graphs but I can walk somebody through it has shown some graphs and they get it in about two to three minutes\nBut every twenty point increment below seven forty they want us issued a little bit more a little bit more more and again that's on the conventional world now if you let's say you've got a six twenty score\nAnd you only have five percent down then you're going to want to go to ... because the nets ha loan doesn't hit you and penalize for\nThe lower credit score it kind of accept everybody as as one so that's the cool part about that with ... versus um conventional but they both they both have different qualifying rules and everything but\nI don't want to get too deep into that and were pressed up against another break but when we come back from this break we're going to get into your income and your job why you do not want to change jobs why you do not want to go self employed guinea all say heck I'm done punching the clock I'm going to start my own own job my own company\nAnd then go try to buy that kind of set you up for the vast and we're talking about I listen to the money man my show you're on TALK radio Fifteen to end the ... we're\n[noise]\nWe're back to the money to like show here on TALK radio with\nEach year we have for\nI don't I mean talking about [noise] what do you need to know about the process of the law\n[noise] and the key things down payment in combat ... credit as the documentation [noise] I'm an impartial\nThird party appraisal which that's a loaded question right there a lot of stigma right they're stable income and good ... good credit history\nAnd before the break we were really talking about the credit stuff and we were just starting to transition into your job and you know it's part of the American dream to kind of for some Americans it is to own your own company drawer and stop working for\nYou know a Boston punching the clock and you know go out on your own and do you think I don't know I mean you you ... another example but I'm example of it and it's it's it's fun it's rewarding and a lot of times\nYou make a whole lot more money when you get on your own and you do you do the only thing man\nBut the problem with when somebody tries to go out on their own right when they're trying to buy houses\nYear pay structure is completely changes and when the key things in this list is stable income now you may be making more money self employed but the problem with that is\nYou don't receive weekly paychecks are bi weekly paychecks or monthly however you're old companies to pay\nUs self employed you really only have one paycheck gets reported to the IRS once a year once a year ... turn that your tax return you think draws you do take drugs but it's not your pay\nAnd the ... the differentiating factor here is ... is that with if you aren't at St taking Adderall where you are paying yourself however you want to do it\nYou're not paying taxes on that you don't pay taxes until the end of the year [noise]\nBeen during the year you're accumulating all these expenses\nThat you're going to take those expenses and subtract them from your profit or your income and what's left is your profit and with the self employed rules you can take advantage of the IRS tax codes that allow you to write everything off to the point where you might not pay any taxes period\nBut the problem with that is you're not showing any income either oh yeah but you just negate it at all wrote it all off to reduce tax liability in contrast back to a W to employee who's working for a company
