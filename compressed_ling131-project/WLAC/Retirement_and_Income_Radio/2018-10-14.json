breach is an open you're doing something about it to protect yourself\nThe headline from NBC News so it could be fake news NBC News the same outlet that his pretending to president is holding Roberts Lee up on high while ignoring the fact that he talked um globally about Ulysses S grand meeting ...\nBut it fits their narrative better to pretend like he only said the part about lead\nSo NBC News fake news NBC says Facebook says hackers so personal info or fourteen million people these supposed data including relationship status birth date hometown education and the Fifteen most recent searches Facebook said\nDavid Ingram wrote this\nFacebook said on friday that hackers were able to access to personal information of fourteen million people through security flaws of the company first disclosed last month and other data exposing returned information such as raising chickens and searches\nSo if you're not connected with me but you were able to hack into my account you know where I Am you know what I'm looking up in other words I have no privacy of his website it all\nBack to the story Facebook sending a blog post that people would be able to check whether they were affected by the attack by visiting your Facebook help center on line the company also said that in the coming days it would send customized messages to users to explain what information might have been access\nThe social networking company disclosed two weeks ago that a security flaw in Facebook's view as\nFeature had allowed ... ended up potentially into and potentially take over people's profiles Facebook the world's largest social media network of more than two billion users has faced rising criticism but it's failed to protect people's privacy they disclosed this year that personal information of up to eighty seven million people\nWas taken by the maker of a quiz up and then wrongly handed over to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica\nFacebook did not say who might have been behind the latest attack or certain groups of people were targeted but it said it was working with authorities including the FBI to investigate\nThink about that you truly go to one of these Web sites and it's all Facebook is a freaking website some do first made up a website in college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on campus though Facebook is what they started getting rid of a judge made at Facebook\nThat you know blossomed into well yeah everybody wants to go meet hot guys and girls sure what\nThe hell we could share picture to Ellis is get my family to connect to that and then it became a very powerful outlet it used to be that if you if you follow somebody you solve their stuff every time they followed us all your stuff every time then they start employing something they call an algorithm\nThey didn't make up a term obviously algorithms that around but\nThey've got an algorithm that actually says I Know what you're looking at I Know what advertising you clicked on I Know who you most respond to therefore I'm going to use this algorithm by what I Know about your habits on my website and I'm going to send you what I think you want to see\nAnd then a blossom into I'm going to not send you what I don't want you to see and then it's I'm only going to send you the stuff we want you to see\nAnd now that we're floating around in ... there were started in trying to find a hot chicks on campus now we have no idea whether we have any privacy at all\nI mean it's logical when rational to fake I've connected with\nMartin on Facebook I should be able to see more and stuff if you took the connection if I'm not connected to him I shouldn't be able to see his stuff maybe as profile picture of your lets me maybe the fact that he has a profile that's fine but whatever he doesn't want me to see I shouldn't see\nThese hackers were able to go on there and see everything\nEverything end in some instances we don't even know how many really very able to take over\nThe actual social media presence\nThat's next to me man that's crazy\nAnd still these stories are reporting so infrequently we have no idea\nWhat people are doing on Facebook or Twitter with our stuff we found out not long ago from project very tossing James O'Keefe that Twitter actually has mushy language that will silence you if they don't like what you say\nOr they will read all of your direct messages because they feel like it and it's like a whole lot whole lotta nothing we can do about it it's so weird to me it just makes me a less trusting person what website can attract trust mind [noise]\nTo dress the radio station Web sites [noise] with social media [noise] it turns out our greatest fears are alive and well we're going to somebody else's website we're giving them all of our personal information and guess what\nMany times they mishandled it wow newsflash right [noise] but break we're back after this or the weekend with Joe pacts there [noise]\nYeah it was the weekend with a ... pound [noise]\n\nTalk radio now you're going through and I can tell me what lazy [noise]\nMethod ... burning your degree from\nTaking a a simple way to ... you know get inferior results it's actually using a more secure way to get superior results which I'll teach you you see the volatility index reflects the expectations of the volatility of the S. and P. five hundred that's the\nGold standard of what all of the wall street money managers aspire to get as close to\nIn performance but long term none of them ever have that's what we call investing and\nThere was a distinct difference between investing and indexing and I'm not talking predominantly about in indexing type of an annuity some people confuse that\nThese are techniques that the ultra wealthy of used for years that I was fortunate to learn almost Twenty years ago and have applied for my own family that has saved our bacon\nIn a safe so many other clients that we felt now for over these period of years and the time is upon us folks are the key is not being too little too late because many people unfortunately will have time to recover\nSee or CNBC came out there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts watching the sharks right with the u._s. stock market in the midst of an October sell off some Wall Street top chart watchers are worried the situation could only get worse\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go [noise]\nUh the ... a warning for boomers this was out of NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash and then sadly Fox News reported that both Amazon and Facebook just on ... this past Wednesday plummeted\nTo the worst day in seven years I could go on and on folks but I think you get the picture and let's review what we do to solve the stock market loss risk by first looking at some facts right last month\nWe it's actually under the longest Bull Run in history being about nine and a half years no bull market is ever made it to its tenth birthday I've been preaching this the second longest bull market was the dot com right the tech\nBoom and bust of the nineties which caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent and while there's no guarantee obviously that the bull market will crash officially right uh [laughter]\nUh fortunately the bang that many people think that this is my next market correction is going to cause will not be a whimper\nIn as the experts who study behavioral finance note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for getting you know for forgetting per se the lessons that pain of past crashes caused as many people are still folks I see this on a weekly basis are woefully unprepared\nFor the next downturn right Peter shift as some of you are familiar with Peter [noise] uh he says a U.S stock market crashes long overdue but people are oblivious right now to exit its biggest game this past month since the year two thousand right as I said history has a way of repeating itself [noise]\nBack in the two thousand peak though it hit for many people from peak the trough in eighty percent loss\nRight now thinking about that so the fact that we haven't had a month this strong being the prior month\nSince two thousand should give people pause which we've been preaching day in and day out\nIt's long overdue Peter says it can start at any minute which obviously this last week proved\nBut people are oblivious infect Jim Rogers Susan investment commodities guru with one of the longest positive return track records on Wall street said we're heading towards the worst ... excuse me Barry market of his lifetime\nHe says when the problem in the stock market is going up is based on a slew of misconceptions about the U.S economy when reality sets in\nBeat her says you're going to see the U.S market tank\nAnd folks whether it tanks whether it cracks whether it crashes the reality is retire your risk of stock market downturn right create your own protected pension plan have peace of mind having a secure\nFuture cash flow for your retirement income that won't be disrupted when the next market crashed or correction comes now or when it comes later\nRight in ... and please be advised to stay away right of one of them are shared how much he had lost by being advised from listening to more of a TV personality posing as a fraudulent financial investment advisor advice\nThat ended up costing him a ton of money and I won't name names but we kind of call it the entertainment channel of folks that are telling what to buy and sell in fact this particular uh [laughter]\nFraudulent financial advisor investment advice giver a TV personality said uh two days before Bear Stearns a celebrating its ten years of going under back then two days before said by all of Bear Stearns that you can\nFolks nobody has a crystal ball that's why you can play it safe and have upside without downside now the second biggest boomer concern is not just number one as a as a reminder having a stock market protection plan but also having a tax\nProtection plan and you see how you can eliminate unnecessary taxes is indirectly the form of getting a better return right if you're not giving up ten twenty thirty forty who knows we're tax rates go fifty percent that's better than earning ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent\nAnd that's a given not a an assumption\nAnd avoid the government tax gained folks because the government's gotta tax game I I can assure you they do I see a time in and and and and time again where people don't know what they don't know or as I like to say you can't be aware of something you've never been made aware of\nAnd they get exposed to now becoming what's called the perfect taxpayer they did everything right they defer their tax deferred accounts of their company for ... for three bees\nAnd then they hit that day of reckoning when they are forced to take require distributions or if they start taking distributions out of their irate early they didn't expose up to eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed\nAnd then depending on how much tax they have to pay by the distributions they're forced to take or that they decide they have to take [noise]\nThen they can ... expose themselves to paying penalties on their Medicare part B and deep premiums but it never stops there the end up not realizing they're leaving a major tax burden inheritance to their kids\nIn fact one client shared I Know why you Charles Oliver reside in the state of Florida is a no brainer way to save taxes on a state tax level and folks we helped numerous\nPeople in numerous states and yes there are many opportunities ah by choosing one of the nine states that has no state income tax as a start right let me share with you the biggest over payment of tax traps the boomers face\nRight now right in fact a money talk at a an article out saying one of the top golden rules for retiring rich one of which is you can imagine was minimize your taxes\nYou know it goes on to say the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam take too much of their money\nIn America set a former federal judge Leonard hand said there are two tax systems one for the informed\nAnd one for the uninformed however both\nAre legal folks when you look at the fact that the he'll just reported that our deficit is already sorts seven hundred and eighty two billion just year to date and twenty Eighteen\nRight and the overall federal deficit sword Seventeen percent and fiscal year uh Eighteen stuff's far right according to the congressional budget office do you tell me where you think taxes are heading\nDo you think taxes are heading higher or do you think taxes are heading lower and the big question becomes are you ready\nFor your twenty team tax or you're twenty Nineteen tacked on some of the you can still say tax for twenty eight teams there are proven hidden wealth solution tax savings technique techniques that were helping people with on a weekly basis but it's also then the tax bill you're going to face in twenty Nineteen for the decisions that you have to make\nIn twenty eight teams so here's the opportunity I'm going to be teaching this coming Tuesday and I'm going to be teaching an educational Web and are now the couple of things that you understand that\nIt's women are how you can have upside without downside to have stock market correction protection but\nAlso how you can have tax protection from unnecessary government tax scheme tax loopholes now these aren't a deceitful their legal ethical and moral but many people have said oh my gosh I had no idea\nUntil I took the time to investigate\nRight what I needed to learn that no one had ever taught me my I just had this with the client this week uh an educator has been in the educational system for years said you know none of the advisors I met with the physician my retirement even talk about taxes\nAnd none of them when I asked them Chuck about how you can have upside double digit potential returns with no downside exposure or they wanted to classify that as an annuity and said well those those annuities are kept at like three or four percent growth focused not annuity\nSo she said I'm so glad I took the time to investigate to through your educational process and here's the opportunity to go to retirement protected dot com\nThat's retirement protected dot com and register it say a complementary log on to learn educational weapon are in fact the first fifty people who register I Want to go in and attend I Want a gift you my most recent book the baby boomer retirement breakthrough world teach you the five greatest Trapster retirement\nI'll teach you what the flu and have done\nBy having the court for success criteria that we find most Ninety nine out of a hundred people at about Ninety seven out of a hundred people don't have that they learn and I'll be teaching that this Tuesday now if you refer you can\nSimply call eight five five six six eight to nine to eight that's eight five five six six eight to nine to eight but you've got to hurry I teach all over the country and there's different time zone so be sure to reserve the time zone that works best in your schedule well space is still available [noise]\nYou know inclined to share last week the sitting you know I'm so glad I took the time to investigate how to insulate our savings from losing to the market again or to unnecessary taxes\nIn the strategy is very simple as the market goes up your money isn't in the daily ups and downs and all around the stock market right especially with all this volatility but ironically the volatility itself actually makes this strategy better\nNow I Know that sounds kind of odd or counterintuitive so how can volatility helped me Chuck let's let's think about this\nWhen when the market has again our clients lucky in that game never risk of giving net gain back\nWhich is not what anybody else has I can assure you [laughter] I I I personally sit with clients on a weekly basis and and I can't believe nor can they the exposure that they start to realize they have by some of our software analysis [noise] one just the other day with would lose fifty five percent of another oh wait market crash hits [noise]\nAnd they can't afford that is no one could it but if the same time when there's again it's locked in huge peace of mind sleeping better no worry right and when the market does lose there's the floor of protection\nSo if they lock in but here's the key low reset\nSo if the S. and P. today let's say sell a thousand points are clients don't lose they lock in any prior gains not at risk of giving them back\nAnd then they get the advantage of the index that they're tracking only games not losses to Theresa sad at the lowest point\nTo start their next game right so in other words if the S. and P. loses a thousand points the folks have to wait for that thousand points to be made back before they start any new game our clients start their new gained from the lowest level forward\nFolks that is huge that's a way to out Fox Wall Street and how we've been getting that done and helping clients secure they're serious retirement savings\nFor over two decades now here's the things I I Want to teach you this coming Tuesday so for those that have saved at least\nTwo hundred thousand or more are typically between the ages of forty five and Seventy five I don't care if you're getting to retirement or you're getting through retirement you can improve you can increase this isn't about playing it safe\nThis is about playing it strategically and this is outperformed the market this has outperformed the unnecessary taxes and it's helped people do a few things number one avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax to\nA number to avoiding having their retirement income tax to\nA number three avoiding leaving a unnecessary inheritance tax to your kids or your grandkids and ultimately giving people the ability to live more and ironically leave more all without\nTax but also without the sleepless night concerns of when the market did its thing right if you remember back when it did its thing an eight hundred point drop or an eight hundred point gain was the norm not the exception folks I think it's back\nAnd whether it's back or not can you honestly say you have a stock market protection plan and an unnecessary tax protection plan because you can\nUm here some of the things I Want to teach you tax free liquidity having access when and how you need it\nMarket volatility protection right the uh the removing the uncertainty of when the next crash or drop or correction takes place and ultimately with now running a seven hundred and eighty two billion dollar\nDeficit through twenty Eighteen right folks the writings on the wall where taxes have to go so here's the opportunity for those that register and it's in the first fifty I Want to give you my most recent book the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to waste safe and secure retirement\nAnd what I Want to do is for those either ... I'll be teaching this coming Tuesday\nAnd it's a complementary educational Web that are simply log on and register while spaces available at retirement protected dot com\nThat's retirement protected dot com retirement protected dot com or call eight five five six six eight to nine to eight that eight five five six six eight to nine to eight folks believe in better you work hard for your retirement retire your risk get peace of mind planning in place retirement protected dot com\n[noise] greenery economic and certainly they are expected to go higher and report the deficit are and [noise]\nDidn't well three heroes the best selling author shark all over\nHis mission is helping you discovered and uncover your hidden well\nProtect yourself from taxes inflation and marketing lawsuit\nBy just shut down for welcome to hidden wealth radio where they've been\nTeaching baby boomers and business owners how to eliminate unnecessary taxes strategically ethically morally and of course legally\nAnd teaching them how to grow money without this tax distribute money without tax and to do it with market double digit potential upside without ever a negative market down side\nAnd I want to teach you how to have what I called the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to a safe and secure retirement and we've been keeping a focus on taxes especially with the house just passing this last week tax cut to point of making the tax cuts\nPermanent now that's looking to be the case would of course there's obviously a lot of pushback\nA fact it it passed the house a hundred and Ninety One positive votes to twenty two negative votes of course with the Republican led house right to approve the legislation and things pretty much went along party lines but here's the challenge that we have\nRight is that many people are accusing or making the assumption which I think there is some validity to it that this could really blow up the deficit by already adding one point five trillion to a tax cut one point to and then add fuel to the fire with tax cut to point out you\nCould create a serious danger to the uncertainty of where tax rates will have an impact on taxing us by those of you listening to save at least a quarter million or more towards retirement\nThat somebody's gonna have to pay for these tax cuts\nAnd the reality is those folks they're gonna have to pay for the tax cuts are the people that work the hardest and save the hardest unfortunately are going to get taxed the hardest\nAnd here's why this is important because with this vote right\nThere's a lot of let's say other party opposition because of the concerns let's just say with the midterms there's I was going to be a lot of pushback but there was interesting uh one of the professors economic professors I've been studying for a while Theresa\nDriller to do see I don't know that I've always ever pronounce your name appropriately [noise] um her question isn't an article this past week who benefits from the tax cut ten months later from tax cut one point\nAnd she goes on to say ... regrettably the president's tweets turn out not to be true right with the economic expansion unemployment at ... at a new record low gross domestic product better than it's been in over ... basically a decade\nAnd perhaps that's why voters aren't so enthusiastic about the tax cuts she says because she said there's really no definitive detail of proving that this tax cut is actually doing anything\nWill folk so low I mean look look around the only thing that's keeping us out of the dismal massive recession and I would argue to say we're in a recession we're just faking that recession out how long we can fake that recession out is anybody's guess right we've kind of kept this Bull Run going\nBecause Kennedy the trees that goes on to talk about that you know the claims of the president which I Would say are true has obviously continued to keep this bull market in check\nBecause again the buybacks right the corporations that cut their top tax rate from thirty five to Twenty one and now that looks to be a permanent as well as the tax reform bill for the cutting the tax rates obviously for a lot of folks especially the folks that have strong income and have have strong savings\nAs actually created a false positive right because a lot of companies turned around and bought their own stock back which is giving this sense that the economy is going to just continue to roar and go positive and a bullish direction and many people are saying the market's going to come because being nine and a half years into this Bull Run noble runs ever made a ...\n... and nobody knows right and I talked about last week on his wealth radio the top concerns that boomers your friends and neighbors are sharing likely the same concerns you have are the the the uncertainty of the economy and how long this is going to go I talked to apply this week that said Chuck [noise]\nUh the calls it instead of Murphy's law his last name as a law saying you know as soon as I sense that things are good I can see the market going bad this is the client the last fifty percent twice between two thousand one two thousand two that was one or two and then again between two thousand eight and early two thousand nine\nAnd he said you know I Can't afford to do that and folks he's right you know this is a client\nA wife or his wife are in their mid to late sixties between the two of them and the reality is they don't have time to make up for another two thousand and eight or two thousand to two thousand and two market debacle and many people are predicting even the great Warren Buffet that it's not a matter of gift\nIt's a matter of when and when is unfortunately going to cause what some are even claiming to be the worst recession or the worst economic downturns in their lifetime and these are folks that are talking about this that are well respected on Wall street\nThat have been doing what they're they've been doing now for forty years\nFolks look here's here's the importance of this point right and I and I think this is this is key the the top retirement solutions that others miss\nWe're supposed to call that our home this very day by the wind and the next day like this why well apparently are real tricky not stress to the buyers how they needed to put in it for educational application\nBumped shirt the kid mounted buying a house for him because I have a job\nSo he probably on the verge of being qualified combined home and were freaking out because we took it gets kind of Monday at sixty day loan out of my husband's IRA because it's kind of\nWhy why did you do that\nYeah that's exactly what it maintains and all night 'cause we ... we just thought it was just it was just going to be temporary transaction oh I put it back in right away and no penalties\nClothes on your do you\nKnow what still be on Thursday\nAnd what happens if you don't close on Thursday\nI being told if they have the option of putting a treat to stand down and to reach cashed it should we tell our house and I wanted to know what you felt about these three cats alone what\nIs your clothes on Thursday\nI guess if you're going to be and you have backup office already and they said their home\nOkay so ... this is not the manufactured home this is a homeowner\nYes you know the manufacturing home actually worse than even make a ten to twelve thousand dollars\nYou know how much of a how much of an earnest my trick that you put down\nWe put three thousand down\nAnd you're probably gonna lose that if you don't close\nRight and\nIt was the measure ... to have a contingency on the sale of your other on\nYou know they would not allow any continue out here a house gets ... and almost sold by the end of the day\nYou know sometimes you know so you're saying all along market you know so I'm armed here's what you're doing you're getting desperate and every time I get desperate I get stupid and you're about either but you need to not close on this house Thursday let it go\nIt's okay it's telling myself and it's just a house I have to work and all the house to house\nSit and you know we feel like we're getting throwing away to Ninety dollars a month that\nYou're young you may be but it's just a house in six hundred and Ninety dollars nature problem you're getting ready to make a multi hundred thousand dollar problem and then if your house doesn't sell over back in Iowa for two years you're up a creek and\nWe're not out here in any any um Longmont, Colorado we're seeing if actually home\nIn all the manufactured home that didn't that the kids not closing on\nHis mind okay not a whole hog cash deal okay\nAnd we just found out yesterday for wheelchair which it sure does the kitten heritage put this application for weeks ago when he put the offer and ... and we didn't find out he didn't you know\nYou just need to sit there and you're manufacturing home and manufactured home until you get it so when you get it sold and when it closes only then can you close on another purchased and if that me and if that means you rent for a little while in between it means you rent for a little while in between you know we're going to end up with two houses\nYeah I Know I don't really I used to be honest and you you don't do it on ... brother went appreciate\nThat but don't do it you know what happens is is you get caught everybody does she do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of this the story of this and it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to do things but you don't have to do anything\nTo kill my husband like we don't have any interest the house\nAnd you know it's just how your mind when\nYou remember how your heart felt big an open when you move to Colorado When you're going to try new adventure\nI Know everybody kind of\nThe same as just the opposite of that I Know your heart I feel like it's in a cage\nAt ... ... yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now in ... we had\nYou know why you feel cornered is because you're cornered wondering why you would feel court so here's what you do when you're cornered user up your hands and you walk out\nYeah I did that last night I walked out with my husband was talking to the ... I said I Can't even ...\nI it's not a matter of not dealing with it I'm not talking about a voice on TALK I Know I mean I won't go a little bit of Neil ... I'll be happy to close\nOn this deal when my trailer cells yeah\nWhen my trailer is so my trailer hasn't so I Can't close until that happens and so if you guys need to dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to the next guy and that's probably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver you'll get you another house and don't get desperate\n'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate as soon as you feel forced\nThat's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you should be close on\nThey should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it on because you're just not going to close\nIs if you do you're going to regret it you're going to end up on in both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem\nIt's going to damage your finances is going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell them just we're going to have the brakes boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed and we'll close if we can't then we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well\nI'm I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday\nAnd then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling and um I Would walk that's exactly what they're calm down\nMark is with us in Indianapolis I mark welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThank you for your service sir thank you how can I help\nWhile I'm sixty and I have six little properties three that are free and clear and three that have small mortgages and I just always assumed that we would probably sell one of the time are basically about now they'll start now and in that that would be part of your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute you ... have you with the\nUh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security to limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make per year before they uh\nThey like you and he says way that on long held investments I don't know that that applies\nTo upset her out and I think I think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with them I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment just to change my Social Security stuff\nSocial Security is not that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep them even if it does mess up Social Security\nWhere they're profitable and yeah we've we've been I guess you'd say successful with it but they're not the you know there is Britain brother ran a three bedroom one bath houses\nAs best gun I stay rented it was a big market for 'em right\n[noise] uh yeah yeah but as you know you know rich period I mean when you're sixty fifty five on this and you're saying you've been through with Reuters and\nIf you don't want for renters that's a different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security bravo\nI may or may not cause they're so scared abroad may be passive income might not come up with Social Security and maybe you might want to sell 'em anyway if you just don't like being on the runners anymore but overall is real estate investment to carry all the way through retirement if you don't mess around with it that's that's a good investment and this is the\n\nThomas production officer for the day rain show\nLast show these days and these\nGuys are going to say all the time that if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else I'm so excited to introduce our brand\nIt's a picture for you exactly you got your picture in like okay I can see my furniture in here because you've already set the dining\nRoom ... all the big question is are the staging companies starving right now\nI don't know I guess it depends on I have I don't have any stage and I say none\nI mean the houses are selling so quickly but yet staging is still an important piece of the\n... now I Do have a listing that\nI it just went under contract and I think the main reason it didn't sell initially because it was ever priced but they didn't have a lot of furniture in there and they had furniture just like in storage said they took a lot of furniture out of storied where I set it up in their house yet properly like set up their living room like a real living room and\nOn top of that also are like wow I'm enjoying it again so I don't know I didn't go so\nYou know they're also getting a benefit out of it but their house also went under contract and I got better at data pictures and it did paint the picture and it\nSold it went under contract almost immediately when they're probably saying why are we found is again yeah now that we're enjoying it [laughter] yeah\nEvan a soldier more so I guess you'd call it\nYou know the study goes on to say fifty percent of the stage home saw an increase in dollar values from one to ten percent\nSo a buyer perceived that the house was worth more I guess they're they're trying to say here because they could see the way they would live in the house themself because so many people are visual\nAnd if you're not a visual person then you can kind of\nFigure it out yourself up so many people are visual they need to see it come to understand that sometimes\nAnd you walk into like you're saying a a house it's ... or the choppy for plant or a unique for plan your instantly questioning hey will\nWell our couch fit there well our TV fit here what about our dining ... you you don't ... question for them yeah yeah and it's instantly without it even be coming up coming up as any kind of a obstacle or anything like\n... okay here's a good staging question for your time so this the stated company comes in states do house and then the ... that's all you know we love it we want to buy it and we want all the furniture that's currently in it sometimes that's national our credit no that yeah\nAnd I will say this that most of the time I mean I ... in my experience anyway most of the time when houses are staged a are vacant homes\nThat makes them and they ... when you live in your house I mean what are you going to live under yeah sometimes you'll have a few pieces brought in here and they're like you you know you're not essentially delightful on stage\nUm but if it's a fully stage house where you're hiring a professional to come in and do the whole ship bang it's usually a vacant home\nYeah I can see that like a builder home or of a flip yeah and you know yeah\nAnd I see where they bring in those numbers especially when it's like a little small you know twelve hundred square foot house in an area that's just starting to turn and they go in and stage it to where it's just cute as a button and then you know the wife comes in and just\nLovely ... fell in love faith and stuff he's ready to top dollar for that ... even though that stuff don't\nRead it you gotta buy all that happens they go on to say in his article at the top rooms of stage in order to attract more buyers is deliver ...\nMaster bedroom kitchen and dining room which makes it makes a lot of sense there so if you're curious about stage and her don't think you see the value in it\nUm I think again check out on line and when I'm In my ... we'll put this article out there and we've got a job out to a break but we'll come back we'll talk about first time home buyers and the fact that first time homebuyers continued to put less than six percent down when they are by\n... percent down\nAnd we're doing some loans with zero down but less than six percent down so your question whether or not you have enough money to make this work or you need to give them more likely we can make it work for you to listen to them and make show here on TALK radio Fifteen tend to see\nHow you see [noise]\nBack to the money man my show here on TALK radio in the end of your life the way things are really a\nMovies and in the studio we have\nPay a\nSo first time homebuyers [noise]\nYup they're out there how many\nTimes do you meet with a client because a lot of times you will talk to them first before they even gone to the pre approval process and then sometimes are already pre approved but when you talk to the ones that are not ...\nAnd I don't say this\nTo be negative or anything but sometimes they are clueless on really what's going on and sometimes they've gone out on the on line and they've read so much information they confuse themselves potentially absolutely they really don't know what's right what's wrong or what they should or shouldn't do\nSo the the next best thing is coming to somebody like you are myself for somebody that's professional an industry that can basically substrate yet but six percent down\nFor first time homebuyers is the number that uh the national ... National Association of realtors uh put out again and another a recent publish a publication they released and stated that sixty one percent of first time homebuyers purchase their homes\nSo we showed them the the pros and cons of doing it this winter like a hundred percent on board that's exactly what we want to do exactly what we wanted to do we just to no avail yeah but\nIt and then you ask you don't know that that you were in your eyes me now\nI mean you've you were always in school and they probably still do it the day I mean the stupidest question of dumb question is the one that's ever asked right you know and you might be working at a hospital um you might be working at a a pharmacist a pharmacy job I Know nothing about that stuff right so that's\nWhy we rely on you you rely on an expert\nYeah you go get a prescription fill you didn't talk this through the pharmacist about this\nI think a lot of people confuse a twenty percent or for the for the ... um with what they have to have down in other words they don't realize the difference I think I'll have to twenty percent down\nI Would agree with that and that goes back to the old rules or\nYou don't want monthly mortgage insurance that's how you're gonna get the most the cheapest most ... economical payment but not everybody has twenty percent ... district so then you've got to and that's what our job is to find what's the most economical way for you to get this house with a loan that does have then I\nMet my that came out kind of slurred let alone that does had them I ... a conventional loan and then what's the best\nProgram for you based on your individual credit score\nAnd you know financial situation because some people and that's a long if Jay loan is the way they have to go because of their finances and there's nothing wrong with that we've had people that their doctors their you know attorneys or whatever or they their self employed and just the way they their incomes paper trail where they can prove it or can't prove it\nEssay chase it a little more lenient for that yeah so it's a stepping stone\nThey ... for every buyer that fly just having someone look at it that eyes on it and tell you what they think is the best route for you is you know it's not going to hurt to ask\nNow and then everyone didn't eventually get to the point where well if I go in and oh by the house with an F. I. J. lo and I have to refinance in a year or two and go to the conventional I'm now I'm paying ... a refinance costs again\nWhat what today's loans we can position to skip two months mortgage payments so by the time you add that up and compare it to the cost to re fi you're almost back into the black in some cases you are back in the black much time you make your first mortgage payment on your new alum so again don't be scared or intimidated to ask ask questions contacts and we'll be glad to wash\nHis [noise] we've got about another breaks and we get back to talk about your house buying power and how that's being affected by the\nSales numbers and everything else but [noise] I don't think it's kind of surprised at how buying power is going down as the prices are growing up but there's more to the just the middle of an actual here I suffered if it's ...\nTo the money they make show here on TALK radio and WNYC\nBeen really and you're\nHome by a power your house buying power [noise] you know this article that was put out [noise] um but first American and first American title we don't have ... here today but first American is one of the largest auto companies out there so they basically have access to all of this data and they can see all these\nNumbers are getting and they can project things and that can ... things so when they put numbers like this out it's actually it's not their opinion um I mean it's just straight up the way it is\nAnd yeah they said in the most recent a home price index report that while it may be true in in a few metros across the county a kind of country rather\nHome affordability is not a challenge\nIn the majority of the country\nWhich I don't know if I agree with that guy I mean they have the data to support it but I mean they're saying that home affordability is not a challenge and the majority of the country now at the surface what's that mean to you as a real for\nIt means that most parts of the country homes are affordable\n[laughter] what about you Jimmy um what was the question again [laughter] you back they're doing all your\nUh I'm On the ... weren't looking at numbers you know you're watching the numbers and make sure they attract\nThe this report shows that many match\nEven though there are several metros around the ... county ... county country I'm Still thinking David metro area around the country that don't necessarily have an affordability issue ...\nWhat what do you think about that when you find it hard um leagues it seems like at least in this area of the house just keep going up and up and up [noise]\nYeah and that that's that's where I think most people are going to read this and kind of you know they like bull yeah\nYou're almost afraid to sell the house you have because you know the next one's going to be even more expense\nYeah wherever you're making you're putting in the next one right here moving really far out yeah and I I think\nMost people are going to gravitate to that kind of opinion based on this um you know\nMean maybe not if you live in small town America I mean my parents are from North Alabama small town things are not very expensive you know but I have not went up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement and Income Radio", "city": "Nashville", "day": "14"}
