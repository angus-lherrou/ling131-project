Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump were the Pentagon shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he's so\nMostly aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTerror threats in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nThem if you got to stop the main things about me I'll stop and citing angry lunatics to kill you you know whether\nThe president knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated for Trump\nIs doing is stoking inciting for the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his name anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these events\n... ranch is dishonest as they are\nBlind I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that has been ... by the president of the United states for the race\nWas the manager them I think that he's ... dollar an original ...\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally\nJust the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look it would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in\nAnd shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not it's in it's actually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russian collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for it does see a full of Russian lawyer he's\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty six the it was it was used to get fired warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east one super all because of\nThe threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just the number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging y and Z or because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about what they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next say say thank you thank you so much for finally admitting that year old white fashion list and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that\nAre are Lincoln George Soros and these anti Semitic threats\nTo the

say with if you look real clear politics too old for locked in seemingly leaning likely Democrat on the house side and a hundred and Ninety nine locked in Republican side you have all these thirty some odd races that are now going to tip the balance of power for the house\nConventional wisdom says that Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker I'd do look at the polls quite the same way Nancy Pelosi picking out the drapes\nOr for her new office was on the Late Show with Stephen Kobe or protecting Democrats would win big in the midterms let me say this up until today\nI Would have said if the election were held today we will win now I Am saying is we were when we were when we will when she added oh they're a bit freaked out by ... competence please don't say that\nDo you want to say that that on Hillary's a firework firework barge that she cancelled later perform the sign of the cross on his chest and feel like I should sacrifice a goat or something to take the heck's off of what

she wants but that would be in the hands of the\nAmerican people were highlighting these races up on Hannity dot com that will tip the balance of power in the house of representatives all of the Senate races\nAre very very close look much better on the Senate side for Republicans forty five retirements is a lot that means a lot of new faces Southern California later on we'll check in with a congresswoman Mimi waters of California's forty fifth\nCongressional district now they've got literally between Dana Rohrabacher and and these ... old seat\nYou know former New York city mayor Mayor Bloomberg just spent what nine million dollars in Southern California alone\nAlso have a tough battle going on in Washington state and the eighth district Dino Rossi will step in and check in with us a little bit later or in Iowa's third district we gotta fight going on there a lot of outside money coming in as well against David Young\nAnd he joins us now apparently and I love these people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing healthcare healthcare or the way welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us\nThey have people that gave us that they give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare\nAnd so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean and what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and\nThat is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we have those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\n... a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse and I look at this this horrible terrorist attack and the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but I don't they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nAs I've said so many times has been no country on the face of this earth that has accumulated more power and abused it last and used it more for the advancement of humankind around the world paying the price for

little more optimistic than me I just don't know but I have a feeling there's always this question Donald Trump is changed all the rules and politics I don't think a lot of Trump supporters are going to be telling pollsters they're going to the polls\nI don't think they're going to take the call and if they find out as opposed to they're going to hang up because that's what I Would do but I've

with baby I've been friends with baby over two decades\nI was friends with Shimon Peres a hoot Iraq and many other Israeli leaders Ron ... is a personal friend of mine and it's pretty outrageous that this is that they feel justified and making any incendiary comment they want\n[noise] oh that that's why I think that's part of what was going to touch them as often because American people I can get a sense of what's really happening in the country and the American people I Believe are prepared to\nA party and the movement which has the courage to try to save the country that straight from work\nAnd so um I Believe that next to me we're going to a great deal about the nature of America well to learn I think that a billionaire liberals can't buy elections or because the media and people just shrug off their actions and that's not true I don't believe that\nWhy are you so confident in the election now I feel pretty good about the Senate\nBut you know I'm always I guess because I'm Irish but I always uh going into elections I always tell people it's really up to them\nThat's the case this election midterms we have a headwind against us historically speaking only three times in the last hundred years as the party in power in the White House\nOr been able to gain seats it looks like will gain them in the Senate but then we've got you know at least thirty thirty five house races mostly Republicans on defense too close to call\nI think that's right now our reasons um you know it will come from very wise there will be\nVery very gamer and can be rebel a starting about two thousand and with the Tea Party movement and rebelled earlier when Ronald Reagan on a contract with America a rebellion many ways created clump then we're in for them that rebellion\nAnd resolve is you now have states like North Dakota\nMontana I'm a jury\nOr the west Virginia where there is a huge base that we believe that they're involved in a car wash it causes more than just everyday politics and I think it's it's just fascinating to watch because I think the media doesn't get it show up my mind he's got a little car tomorrow\nBasically search on the planet aside because over time if you if you're talking about the ... ah the Mitch\nMcConnell Donald Trump team is going to be in control center and people are saying well so I don't like every judge for the next few years would have been blocked by Sherman\nSick about that all of those workers when Donald she's been historic animation will come to a halt\nThe minute the Democrats control the Senate suggested in terms of judge this is a very consequential election and I looked at item after item after item on and I see\nThat we're going to be in the Senate and my guess is we're somewhere between plus three and a number I don't have the courage to say 'cause it's too high now but I can see the\nWay have you ever not had the courage to speak your mind that just is not true while you're listening but look I'm urging people to be cautious and and act like you're behind because I think we shouldn't take anything for granted like I Believe that Marsha Blackburn\nIs going to win I Believe that ... going to win and Missouri I Believe Heidi Heitkamp is done I Believe that Braun is gonna win as long as people don't vote libertarian in ... Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban for Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and I actually look at the different levels you have nine guys on a carry on state where the Democrats should be safe but his personal or gals uh when the\nSenate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I Am some very very unsavory rumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll carrying to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else but my point to get back into New Jersey is where you can really really good candidates\nWho is a great there see I'm very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop sound practical working alternative to government run health care and um she didn't even have may well\nBetween his own bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez if they just stay home that may actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure it out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and they're I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out one voted\nFor him if he ended up not having to buy election they do not do anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written\nFor the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans having the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought\nWhere do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range\nIs returning the bottom of about two oh one between policy where speakers and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up his speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been standard about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I hadn't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about the myths about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes that they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nNot anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for him and she should be no one should kids themselves if you do not want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase\nIt tells you how crazy their party is how how could you then again she was smart lady because she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services firm [noise] um and she goes out in the last thing you think to yourself [noise]\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all he don't like them or is it sort of a I'm not going to vote not voting is in effect a half vote for Nancy closer to be speaking [noise] um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home\nOr you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you both for\nReticent in Tennessee you're you're voting for sure and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote\nThat's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nMuch I just tell everybody and he wanted to some of the claims or a model\nAt the synagogue used in terms of invaders and invasion tragedies working at cross purposes right narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified hang migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nYou've also times got along with them as as his own all even\nIf I go I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh he's in New York character

Mussolini you know Hitler\nJudging style and mountains in London a lousy doing is just totally disgusting\nStatement of a false showed\nThat people should just knocked down and the people who say only be held in total contempt\nMovies were mass murderers who the exceptional Mussolini or the other is literally are mad money smugglers and now when I when I saw a that was a much mood who wrote the two thousand Fifteen 'cause he would rather go to Joseph Stalin\nThan vote for Donald Trump and he's he's a good insurance Leno's we've you know how honest information I just thought to myself these people are so the range\nBut you can't reason with the meat psychological help\nWell I think it's obvious they need psychological held there's no hope for them at all Newt Gingrich is with us eight hundred nine four one Sean are toll free telephone number well there is some calls in here six days out of the important midterm elections will start in New York they all knew seven ten wor\nUh the talk of New York New Jersey Long Island what's going on John how are you say Speaker Gingrich\nLike a morning in the morning was bigger a pleasure to speak both here um since there is no birthright in the fourteenth amendment pathway for these are immigrants would be left the Democrats and the uh liberals sponsor\nA illegal families that come into this country and their response was let's learn English cutting jobs can match to to get them medical and health but I mean let's put their money where their mouth is and let them adopt these ... these families so that they can earn their pathway to citizenship instead of just walking across the border well thank you Mr Speaker\nI'm not like I think that's that's that's a pretty frankly it's a very reasonable statement of where we are and how we could approach it uh in terms of birthright itself\nOr there is no provision fourteenth amendment once you're handing away Rick orange people who were born outside the jurisdiction of the law to be considered ... and she's very including the beach on it in the Congress of the time and it's clear if you leave that to\nThe constitutional amendment ... very clear and what it means uh I\nPersonally think the president's far better off to ... cents challenge and Congress\nTo repeal it rather than do just as a presidential executive order because there was an executive order the next president who\nCould reverse it but if you turned it into a law there'll be a pretty hard law going to change and once they got adopted and it's a healthy debate for us to have is a country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges the care of it are we as a nation\nAre we allowed to define who is in American are we in a position where we can say to people who are not American you have to meet some test or to be considered a ... to be eligible to serve\nAs a citizen and I'm saying these are very fundamental questions about the very nature of our society and I think it's a very healthy thing

movement that has evolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats are I think it is one party one voice leaning solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nWith which is a vision of two totally different America which you know there there are Americans wanted which\nWe don't teach American history we don't lose the American I'm not proud of the flag no sense of the town of emotionally the star Spangled Banner uh and uh you know we're just one more normal country though to be subordinate it to the un and international bureaucrats\nAnd because we're the wealthiest country in the world we're only seeing huge amounts of money to other folks are because they'd like to be wealthy chew on is the tiny chance that they don't have the money with like you have managed amazing to watch and serious\nOf these folks are and how much they would basically undermining America for the purpose of idea unless\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close attention the Democrats stand for nothing except ... Trump wanting their crumbs back open borders not anything that's going to improve the lives of the ... men and women in this country but it's the speaker you spend a lot of time with us today we really appreciate it thank you and five or six days now till election day I'm sure\nWe'll talk before the election and afterwards and get your take on the results so thanks for being with us look forward to\nEarn eight hundred nine four one showing us our number\nI saw was the last time you and your family just gather around a table and play a game together I don't know probably maybe never in some cases\nMay sound old fashioned but you got to listen to me the new board games that are coming up they're really amazing and you got to try it one I've been telling you about what's in wages as a party game\nBy the way only takes thirty minutes to play everybody all ages can play it it's simple to learn nor the game is going to bring families together like which way there's I've been talking about it for years\nWhat people tell me the feedback I get from people that are played it but we all start playing everyone puts their bones down their devices down and we actually connected the family and real memories are created by the way you can get what's in wages this week target is running a special you buy a game or two you can get with some waitress for free\nIt's the wits waitress party game what's in wages to ...\nAnd the only way that she's going to get that capital back history of California in orange county and in my district\nIt was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when Orange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they had zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California raised was being not important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in in which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls could or the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi there was a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can money at it\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years as you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nToo where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we had over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that are democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment or to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAnd the Democrats have thirty nine and sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where the pendulum swings back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nGet one of the problems is that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York Illinois New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you're more than one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThe union's control Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may start to see that money go out of the hands of the of the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future in the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats in in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for Pelosi hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nWell fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day\nLet's go to Mary is an upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called\nWell New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and\nHas done a thing for upstate New York and the fact that Pennsylvania takes all of the natural gas from New York and they're allowed to frack and you see the economy booming on the other side of the border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and I\nI I'm In that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on\nHealth care as a situation because when they rolled out before to CARE Act became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan\nAnd um I take extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's hes that I've had 'em that are no longer covered and die yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up\nYet again and less coverage getting gang for tests and things that used to be covered and just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that um and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was was calling to talk about the health care\nWell I've got to tell you right now or it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care we've got a big no\nI'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep her plans have less and fundamental ... it's been a failure and the fact that it was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in upstate New York would get the prosperity that they deserve it can be done to instantaneously if they would allow fracking up in upstate New York long before they were ever an advertiser\nI went out and do my own research and I needed a safe for my valuables firearms I Need a safer important papers and
