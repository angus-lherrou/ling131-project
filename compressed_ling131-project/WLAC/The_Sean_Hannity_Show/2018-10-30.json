there are four hundred and thirty five so they're all important every ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's a vote for Chuck Schumer the second potential outcome is a split decision split decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats\nAnd Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff has a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings that chairman and it's endless investigations\nAnd one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted\nWho the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox for thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that while the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this\nYou know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show\nA desperation that is now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand\nSeems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm going to tell you to just ignore the polls at this point does it matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results\nIf you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi\nSenate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often just two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it\nThat he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them and the media nobody there weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in and about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and and I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the median again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read a John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls would they'd been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house\nBy a painfully slim margin one of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and the only thing that can make a difference is if you want\nThe progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the if you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to the next president Frank once was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening\nTurned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I read the same data so if you don't have the sense of urgency\nI don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen because they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms a media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine the Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party\nThey're going to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six he this is a this is all white flash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us\nWith their latest greatest product [noise]\n\nMaking\nAmerica First grader\nSean Hannity talk radio I point\n\nAll right we're talking to bill Stoller CEO chairman of the board of express employment professionals so what can businesses expect in today's hiring market which has changed a lot in the last two years\nWill show this spring

can job seekers look for in this market\nWhere we did a survey of our franchise owners and found the top for ... an attractive and retaining workers were wages in bonuses naturally family benefits education and training in workplace culture\nWhat about business owners or managers can you share examples of some of these initiatives\nBusinesses or expanding leave and benefit policies to include elder care and offering flexibility to address things such as child care and transportation also wages are increasing as well including raises and sign on bonuses\nSo it really sounds like a job seekers market right now what else can you share\nCompanies are looking for ways to offer growth and development within the business versus having employees seek advancement opportunities elsewhere and this can mean offering training and educational system it's not just for the jobs here in but for a future career auction\nI make sense investing your workforce and they'll invest in your

into ... shouldn't be one of them time traffic on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and been deemed to and I well you have the results\nCome in but I'm just going back to Nineteen days before the Republican Senate landslide in twenty fourteen is what Nate Silver five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is close for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much if Democrats eked out victories in those states\nAnd picked up the seat and Kansas they can control fifty feet and keep their majority Democrats also pick up seats from the geo pay and Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable but barred from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that\nRepublicans picked up nine\nDonald Trump didn't win a single state according to the polls John Kerry was going to be president because of the polls\nNow I don't have a crystal ball\nAnd I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard\nAnd the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now\nThat you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district check out my website see if you're in one of those key pivotal tip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important\nAnd when you vote no that if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for ... if you vote for a Republican and if you're you're voting to keep\nThe status quo of economic growth and prosperity and a strong national defense and build a border wall and I'll be a vote for any democratic senator you're just voting for Schumer it'd be a vote for Bredesen McCaskill Nelson\nJoe Donnelly cinema you vote for any of the pastor you're voting for humor [noise]\n\n\nTo an end of the day Ramsey show\nFake news gives utilize Hannity

I assume he does write you don't have an answer okay anyway\nI knew I was talking to our callers I Apologize I Will find out for you and took all back\nWell is that an Eighteen year high if it's an Eighteen year high why is Bloomberg spending all this money\nThrowing him at at democratic candidates so the Democrats can take back the house because we haven't had this kind of economic prosperity growth for all these years that we've got four million new jobs eight million fewer Americans on food stamps and in poverty\nWe've got more opportunity than we've had over a decade for crying out loud things are growing by leaps and bounds why would we want to stop that is what the mid term elections should be about\nBloomberg and eighty eight percent of Bloomberg [laughter] that was a pretty quick thing\nI'm here's an interesting article so the president and millennia go to Pittsburgh today\nAfter the terrible shooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media and all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous\nIt is ugly it is twisted it is sick it is the family story and frankly the there's there's gotta\nBe some legal standard at some point\nThat you ought to be able to sue for such slander and libel those\nComments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi you know who watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted and he's receiving hate mail\nFor saying he would welcome the president to his place of\nPrayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God and the temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from an identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and pro Trump\nWell the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue\nWas anti Trump and as Ron ... has said the ambassador to Israel as Bebe Netanyahu has said\nYou know they've never heard any one president\nEver say stand up that if you destroy our friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome\nTo visit you know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating\nWhat is just the ... nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre rose tenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday\nYou know she exposed this is their hateful garbage abroad that it is and saying those comments come from\nYou know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community the Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever\nThey're not it's not mainstream it's a political group they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway and it was so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful I mean how pastors and priests and\nYou know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nYou know you could see the hostility about all things conservative and Republican you know I called for security and peace and people do take out the differences\nAt the ballot box but that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed so desperate to help their democratic allies and friends when one week from today it's pathetic frankly it's slander and then of itself\nNow we've got to get to the point in this country if you get slandered you ought to be able to sue and have a chance to win or you have to prove the absence of malice well how about an absence of research because if they ever listen to watch they see a very different Sean Hannity than the caricature that they paint\nWhen do you notice it was fair to us in the news media I could not believe\nI was on the front cover of the national Enquirer it's on stands all over the country they were fair to me they actually quoted me a hundred percent accurately which never happens did you notice that I did notice that it's pretty remarkable what can you put that up on a manatee dot com and hopefully if you go to a local grocery store the national Enquirer was fair to me\nTotally fair coated me a hundred percent accurately\nSaid okay and then at different points that I Want to make sure I got your comment right so it was unbelievable\nWouldn't get that on any other

a tight race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it this developer wanted a zoning change in so happy and sure enough later he got that\nThere were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby a buddy of Andrew's saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWas arrested isn't that buying influence and corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for\nSome time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that Iran's that New York junk get paid for a foreign night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under rode a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty six team that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so I don't think I don't know what I'm saying that report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so\nForty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by those\nBut I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum pick this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and the anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel's genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters\nAndrew to this day opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they say they say to us as the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialists principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro flush so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing\nIs endorsed them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June and saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during\nA thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are in the law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants was nationalized healthcare\n... and the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it really up in the arrangements have millions and millions of ... that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase what what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way\nHe'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish men a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also supports legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background that looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate\nUm they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents that release after he lied and the debate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just run Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm uh but the pan handle so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own\nAnd they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election but this loners they're home\nThey're doing a lot ah everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballot\nYou know the bad news as you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend\nA which we weren't sure if that happened that quickly um and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so are they are resilient people in the Panama City area um and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm a ... the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nLook I mean it it's going to take time obviously with me coming in as governor I'm going to have to deal with it and take

this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I mean quite frankly Michael watched I'm a bit um you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two month stretch there in South Florida where people were just getting hammered and within that stature fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so\nAre we need to do whatever weekend but a lot of it as a fault you know the federal government are discharging\nYou know all this water under the river\nA round Santa is running for governor the great state of Florida a Rick Scott running for senator down

line to get results for our community something ... and ... that are in the ...\nThe night and I approve this message\nBy twenty five now till the top of the hour that was the ad for Congressman Steve night California's twenty fifth district and there's been an influx by the way uh he's been in office by the way since ... twenty Fifteen\nRunning against the Democratic challenger Katie Hill and a ton of money now we see millions and millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg who is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job for the people that state anyway he joins us now congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat\nA Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted at a tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today or how much money is being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a kind of hot sauce in say New York city because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nOr that's not something my eye on it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nAnd what do you think the ... what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races are obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\nI think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can uh he can do something there uh this is\nThis has been a held by Republicans for very long time and we're going to win the seat [noise] but ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people get wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean\nThey they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male [noise] um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox [noise]\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house\nThat's the best case scenario one is a split decision they gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen right now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends\nWhether you're going to get to the polls whether you liked the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or we're going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nWe're going to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats\nOr we're going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like you're the same people that ruined the health care system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats vote for ... below sea any Democratic Senate vote as a boat pushed Schumer\nThen we should have a pretty good night a week from now but the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway I

these people even work for them it's it's just crazy the reactions of these people that are going to govern us\nIt really is it's absolutely nuts\nAll right and the next big question I always ask is

live in a society where it's more than I've\nGot all the ... project baritone dot com Hannity dot com huh All right we'll be looking forward to tomorrow's tape as well and I will continue our our

[noise]\nAnd you can keep your plan if you are satisfied when if you like to play in your hair you can keep it\nIf you like your plan and you like your doctor you won't have to do a thing you keep your plan\nIf you like your health care where\nYou'll be able to keep your health care plan if you've got health insurance you can keep your white gr healthcare plan you'll keep your plan\nYou got insurance you like your doctor you like your plan you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan\nIf you have insurance that you would like Ben you won't be able to keep that insurance if you like your doctor or health care plan you can keep it\nIf you like your health care plan you can he keep your health care plan\nSo if you like your plan you can keep your plan\nIf you like your plan a plan\nIf you like your current insurance\nYou will keep your current insurance if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you're happy with what you got nobody is changing\nAnd it'd be like your doctor you can keep your doctor and it'd be like if you want to pay less you can pay less the truth and the reality is tens of millions of Americans lost their doctors lost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of the lie the big promise of Obamacare what is fascinating\nAs we now head into the final week of this midterm election campaign is what Democrats won't talk about now we had earlier in the program we'll had project baritone dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's now been able to expose\nIn Tennessee Phil Bredesen the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat in North Dakota\nChrist and send them out of the Democrat in Arizona that none of these people are being honest with the people in their respective states they don't want a border wall they want sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nAnd in California they want to take it a step further free health care for anybody resident non resident legal illegal doesn't matter Gavin Newsom women's out in California\nOn top of your Thirteen and a half percent state income tax\nNow Californians are going to put up a sign welcome to California the home of free health care and I got to tell you what's gonna happen people are going to go to California just to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exit is out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that people with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you about\nPeople losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well we're we're going to ... where we support healthcare preexisting conditions\nWhile the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting\nConditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow\nLie that Republicans want you to die Republicans want dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist sexist massage it as they can\nXena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd Donald Trump's even though the guy that shot up the synagogue is hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in the way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also\nDirect primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block renting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the
