did\nWell then Cory Booker would be under investigation because there was allegations made about it\nSo this weekend about am never mind what he had already admitted he did on his own on top of Keith Ellison he would have been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation\nI don't know if any of its true the person that seems the most credible here is this woman

trust these polls I don't trust these people that make their predictions you know I follow I I look at it I factor it into what my thinking is I actually think that we should act right now that every race every Republican is behind\nAnd know that if the Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for polo see staying home as I have a vote for below sea and then every important Senate race be at Florida\nOr be a Tennessee or be Missouri or bit Nevada or be at Arizona or Montana or North Dakota or New Jersey even or Indiana that they're all winnable\nYou know there's no scenario would unfold

we'll follow that report the president of Guatemala confirms according to CNN the caravan has been infiltrated by ISIS there's all day the fake news media does this CNN fake news by the way CNN is saying that ISIS reports seven from\nAh the president of Guatemala no one has really mentioned this\nAnyway the report stemmed from an October eleventh article on a prominent ... mile and a newspaper which quoted the Guatemalan president saying the country's law enforcement captured a hundred people linked to terrorism including ISIS\nAnd morale is the President Jimmy Morales Guatemala said during his speech that we have not only detain them within our territory but they had been deported to their country of origin\nJudicial watch picked up that headline again you know the ones I I Can't say

United states I'm assuming most a poor people that the Americas\nThe land of milk and honey and they want a better lives with themselves and their families that's what I'm predicting most of them are Ninety nine percent\nBut that one percent we we can't we don't know that's why we can't have open borders\nAnd we couldn't have many way 'cause we are kind of mean we've already paid billions for educational cause health care costs\nUm this was literally like an invasion if they get through our southern border we're going to protect our border and people on the other side of the border of Mexico would precipitate some type of confrontation people get hurt if we had a wall we wouldn't have that problem\nGetting a little scary out there we don't want that we don't want anybody getting

in Brooklyn or the Bronx you're going to see people waiting to get picked up\nTo go do yard work in construction work and domestic for you know this is not a problem that the people who are coming into the country are solely responsible for harming if we in for them to work my\nWill keep families together\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship number of immigrants added to the labor force every year as a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most co workers provide some benefits calling me as a whole it also turns to the press further the wages of blue collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community\nWho have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status\nOr at least ignore the laws on the books and put them into deportation until we have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair\nIt was suggested that I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more\nIllegal immigration right amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America\nTruth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the uh\nA Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way\nHillary Clinton would have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump or now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support on the Republican Party goes up or I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact would that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand\nPsychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight and a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose I\nSaid I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight but if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and\nI think this this is I think one of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because\nHe he when he talked about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning if if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices they can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them and northern Mexico like if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position to be that that Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back to the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in Sydney powers done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons\nAnd that blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're gonna have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is I Know by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best for planned for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons for doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat if they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact create an effect on human wall\nAnd block people from entering the United states\nNow and then I have what what could be but then as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people because of their ass keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so\nPart of what I'm saying is at this at that point we we have a real decision to make and this is this is what Lincoln as saying over and over again yeah uh you know if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union\nHe didn't say it happily he didn't say it excited we met many key early speeches 'cause this nostalgic sadness to the\nUh the we're bound together by the common core of mystique memory now we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost pleading no don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is\nThe perfect crossroads to make the decision\nAre we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America for in the hands and people blocking U.S forces to cave in guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nWe got to take a break or I Want you to weigh in when we get back on what the next fourteen days are going to look like what you think Nate Silver is a prediction and much more of a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is our guest eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number later on pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh we'll check in and much more\nListen for more than three years there is a software there's been a software vulnerability\nIn the Google Plus social media network on wittingly giving third party developers potential access to use his private profile information\nNow they expected more than four hundred and Ninety six thousand users have shared private profile data with a friend and that could have been their data that is an access by these cyber criminals\nGoogle says no evidence that there's been any misuse of that data but in today's digital connected age you don't know you've got to protect yourself your good name your reputation you don't want credit cards and loans taken out and you're a name you don't want people robbing your bank um retirement accounts blind and ruining your name and reputation\nFormer speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is with us\nThey don't need silver didn't have a very good year in twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast poster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans pick up seats in the Senate I don't have a feel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee Missouri Nevada Arizona for shore North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and\nIf they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\nWhile the ... but I think eighty eighty percent way too high and a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going ... um you know the most recent survey indicates\nThat in fact you have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually\nAre well within about two points from the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not spending much money and I'm we're not campaigning and I'm we're not making our case a but but in the swing sheets that matter a we actually are basically tied the generic ballot\nIn ... and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter should to things happening you see this little bit with Stacey Abrams uh in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit\nUm and and she is just very\nLeft wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate refuses to apologize for urging Americans to shut saying it's okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban um what's happened in Minnesota now where I think Keith Ellison\nMay drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship a because Keith Ellison is just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around\nAt these patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where\nThe ... you know for example when we were talking about ten days ago you and I work but this was a race between jobs and marched well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and if you watch the Democrat\nI ask you can you have you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply either because it's the important wherever fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be voting and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets and you're either going to have raped news all the way around\nMaybe it's going to be a split decision or you're gonna have horrible news\nAnd you get to decide ultimately what that news is going to be this is where your vote actually matters this election counts and you've been shocked the world again and I'm confident that that can happen that can be the outcome I quit break more Newt Gingrich on the other side and later pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh much more\n\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options consider\nCall it today in orange\n... million more for everyone\nTen million it's true and then that one can ten million of new taxes for bureaucrats on a board that we won't even include their representation from all parts of the metro Nashville\n... [laughter] nah no way I'm voting no\nWe are from where I can imagine lying in bed for\n... now and the million dollar tax committee\nNoted author forward to medical correspondent and slump ... user Dr

part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered you're more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JT go\nTo the end of the day Ramsey show later\n\nMold inspires illusions forum merry go this is Sean Hannity show [noise]\nI twenty five fill the top of the hour we've asked to Newt Gingrich to stay with us I Want you to really go into a longer explanation us said Kavanaugh caravan are going to be the defining issues and the next fourteen days people will vote fourteen days from now\nI Would add to that caravan Kavanaugh the mobs we now you saw what happened to Kevin McCarthy how say through a Boulder through the window\nI'm at you saw what they did the Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing league claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the success to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I think that's right um and I think that that in a sense of the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to a total of cherry and attitudes or that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force to a former attorney general saying when the Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people ah and drive them out of public life or you can remember that Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFor the banking and financial services committee if they get control of the house so significant people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of\nThe legitimacy of of the modern of American government which left passionately believes a I'd I think that you're right that that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment\nIs these are historical events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics\nIt was historic we're we're going to get\nA solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be smeared and parents were assassinated and lied and manipulated and browbeat and into backing down so that was that was a historic moment so we'll have an effect for the next forty or fifty years\nA similarly this caravan whether it's seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers rightness or do you have to fourteen thousand\nIf this caravan can get into the United states\nHow big is the next caravan and the shower then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time event here the entire world is watching to see whether or not we have the guts to protect the United states of America from an invasion or and if we don't trust me that there will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly what they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as is offering to provide for them that's where I go\nWell and remember because we we we shouldn't have to have a showdown about this there's no such thing as a ... state\nTo be a sanctuary state you have to decide to your state can in fact imposed on the federal government activities which it cannot possibly impose and at some point we're going to have a big collusion with century ... century stage ... or a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um I have a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that\nThe way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly in the cabin okay you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night\nOr the ... actually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never recovered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores followed them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them then I Want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen of Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering that will help the

how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nParallel economic success fourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever\nI I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk downs of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the other the say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I ... so you know they said well we don't like the some of the ... with the president during the campaign but you can\nTell you say that I have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is going it's not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent of that fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message is rent cream tell him his message was making the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN not blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch

is I really believe you next fourteen days are going to be critical for messaging as long as I'm missing stays consistent also I think that you know there's a script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against the self prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year at the same concerns that the Republican Party a sheer\nRight good to see both Korean we

the north Carolina thirteenth district\nIs up for re election in this mid term in a survey of\nAh friends with the Freedom Caucus and learn hard work family business owner\nOr he got a recognition for his resolute stand against Washington's wasteful spending and the\nCitizens against government waste named him a taxpayer superhero thank God I Love the president's plan that he announced last week that he wants a five percent cut across the board not the penny plan but the nickel plan\nAnd he joins us now in your district does not one of those oh I went by twenty point districts you got a tight race\nSo maybe one day we pray for that Sean but right now we're in a fight or for our country fight for this district a tight thanks for having me on to appreciate the shout out last week on TV as well great to be with you\nWell great to be with you look I've now identified the fifty races that I think will be the tipping point but the balance of power in the house\nAnd if people don't want to turn on the TV two weeks from tonight and hear the words speaker elect Pelosi well you're somebody that needs to win this is one of the top fifty races I'm following\nThat literally where the where the balance of power is going to be made in terms of who's going to control the house look I think we're going to do well in the Senate but you know off year elections are historically what they are and they're tough but I Do think that you have a great chance of holding on to this seat because you've served the people in North Carolina oh\nSo this is a blue moon election for us here in North Carolina there is no governor no us center on the ticket I'm at the top of the tickets so\nYou know well that makes mom really proud of the same time uh it's I'm at the top of the ticket and so we got to make sure that people come out at the for us\nUh Shaun this is a turnout turnout turnout election people just\nHave to get out and go vote a we've got all the way through November third and then back again on November ... the plenty of early voting um you know we've got a lot of good things on the ballot in North Carolina this year\nI'm I'm very excited I think we're going to win this but we've just got to do the work we've got to have people turn out like the president knows how important that says he's been in the district um he's coming back again to the state here friday night that's a sport my hope to be colleague mark Harris down your Charlotte\nBut ah yeah we've got a lot of tough races this year there's been a lot of articles written about North Carolina Thirteen but\nYou know like you said I'm a this is a clear contrast race I'm a conservative member of the Freedom Caucus I'm In a tough district I'm a small business center my opponent\nShe's one of the
