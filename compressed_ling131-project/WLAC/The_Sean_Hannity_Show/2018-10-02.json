saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus have the audacity to make all these charges in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair his righteous indignation is is to our rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament\nWhich is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis absurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand you digital camera I Would hate to have that kind of\nGuy I how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapist who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused to react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're ... wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different uh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded\nLike he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\nOver the garden\nAt ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat fact he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially bleed well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a mashable report because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said with Diane Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh\nThis will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large but it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski in Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school\nAnd college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet that standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and\nIn fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again the statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtracked dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness\nOf drugging girls in gang raping them and now she well he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else I mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time\nAre we even believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer nobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead David well I I I find that again absurd on its face as you say just as I Do uh the the sweating like while the other sweating allegations that just doesn't hold true and I

does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nByron hey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's\nGot to be in two minds a war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that it has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there just wasn't nothing to this story [noise]\nUm and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go

earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week do we have any any timetable idea\nProbably don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here was the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement\nFor compromise has been reached for Chris ... she is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around\nFord allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week\nI think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nWhich was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know that the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar and so are throwing I says like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... that there are any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you'd dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but it'd be a full one vote short you came up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party\nAbandon Brett Kavanaugh delayed legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against ...\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha makes Sally is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for ... claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state from state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well and then we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made a gun and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot all\nBut to have on them is that those are the environment we live in\nSenator and I want in this audience on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or conservative and you run for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it is the home of folk Xena ... you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children\nAnd it's got to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff is as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nDiscount bound for trinity laying around our twenty four\nI'm On the north side from talk\nRadio not ... three and Fifteen tangible you really see a Hollywood Hendricks with your time saver traffic\n[noise] coming accurate mothers that are here talk radio not to use only three and fifty cents W ... forecast scattered showers and thunderstorms continues or the opposite is it eighty three class for tonight Los sixty seven to ... storm tomorrow eighty seven Thursday sunshine reading something up or a\nPower by the accurate mortgage group portrait wedding with the weather channel forecast\nThis report is brought you buy a count temps payroll\nBookkeeping mom fans are you feeling short staffed account temps to provide accounting and finance professionals on a temporary work project says when you need them to help with the Greeks wore gloves and hold them to have more visit account temps dot com account temps or rubber and a half company [noise]\nOn TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen pen W.
