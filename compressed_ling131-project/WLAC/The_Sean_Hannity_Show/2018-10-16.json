C. A. as people with pre existing conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings account so we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh ...\nAnd Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine addict greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this up front pricing lower cost no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nHealth care of local I mean that's the important thing you know health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now if we wait for ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves\nAnd that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it to eliminate\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every Americans worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know in the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh ... gross is probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think that Democrats are

that California I got one cat in New York I mean I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he gets rid of that city\nListen I you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox is a great businessman his his problem is simple math and sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman\nUm and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans are elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could win now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say\nFree health care for everybody in the world it's a ... you're basically our governor saying\nLegal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is packed that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nBut if people want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't really happening and can't get on the way the thinking gotta get out to California can't afford to pay taxes and the camera that\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look I why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New

that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing to Texas\nSo unbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway do you know good luck um I

release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on the same happened to governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nUh we now see Heller was very important state of Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll at least eight I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes I remember that that have hit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama because Mitt Romney at all the\nMomentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager for a Mr Obama at that time\nAnd he said yesterday is and why did Senator Warren have to do\nHer announcement with our DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say and many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the headlines\nThat feeling around she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one\nThousand twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type\nI mean but it is but her she literally personally change herself to minorities than is when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate\nThis is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah sure him to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a girl born by none other than John Podesta but they're\nRunning their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project very pause tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it and Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with Kavanaugh as well even the CNN did\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think\nBack I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America\nGreat again or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like it did and two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her uh if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safer at this point seems to be\nJoe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state tendency red standing\nBy the way that he has a rep I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nNow there you go yeah and and remember ... federal Rourke out more money than any count my gosh they're eight\nMillion dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think they'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because they Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty midterms I have gone against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I ... I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that the Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think back then you you had two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the capital hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\n\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness if possible you could add a trio fair relation one of the leading causes a strobe light out before like cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG divide them just Ninety nine dollars to order the cardio dot com K.\nR.

I'm Sorry I have an audio was complete those those two names uh yeah I mean that that's that's pretty big ... that was thrown out Sean because [laughter] I mean that's the killer that now stormy is actually responsible for Trump's legal fees I ... and by the way\nIt ... should be always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter um but I think what especially during the Kavanaugh hearings with Julie sweating egg\nI mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis you know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls and these boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of the ... almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his ... I Would think a fairly smart guy right and and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to\nThat with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly went back to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the stories at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the four people that's Julie sweating except we're at those parties one's dead\nOr to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't know who truly sweating to watch so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story on hurting on it but it in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process and the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want

twenty five now till the top of the Arab people asking about what we were comparing earlier in the program direct access to doctors um and of course Obamacare because it seems to be the only one issue now that Democrats want to run on and boy it's such a bad portrayal inaccurate portrayal of what they have\nRushed upon the country and the differences dramatic it's different in any way we put it up

talking about when\nI feel like I Know you've been in my living room so many times in may run around with me in the car\n[laughter] well do you want to know the truth you really do know me you know I've always said is you really can't fake it for three our four hours a day I mean he me on TV you hear me on the radio I\nMean I Can't just\nWe don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain\nWho you really are especially that's why they call radio warms the medium\n... you're exactly right you're exactly right looked shutting the reason that ... that was this known your program yet they find the delivery Clinton's speech in in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return just civility\nIn this country used to elect Democrats and then when I heard it down on me that's extortion telling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up if Democrats [noise]\nOne way to put it but you gotta understand since the day Donald Trump\nWon the left in this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob and some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchists symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera all of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd\nGet a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them\nYou know wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen\nAnd the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos or ... it is either they're not telling Maxine Waters pet said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because then you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the cheap Bernie
