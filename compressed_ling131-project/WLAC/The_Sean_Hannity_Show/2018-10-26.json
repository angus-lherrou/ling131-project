half\nOf Americans receive more in some kind of government transfer payment Medicare Medicaid food stamp\nSocial Security then they pay in federal taxes more than half\n[noise] one thing that this explains why so many people don't think tax cuts are a big deal if your life is dependent on all kinds of government transfer payments well whatever you want to call it\nAnd tax cuts you think are going to lead to the government having less money than you're not going to be in favor of tax cuts so we've got\nHalf over half of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes they're going to understand here that tax cuts and I remember all the news stories about how the Republican tax cut bill didn't end up being that big a boon\nFor the Republicans in polling that's a major shift just

will happen we can afford to risk\nAmerican lives with Hillary Clinton um and she was one of the people that was targeted by by all of this but other postings you know um if you look at a that they don't seem to express admiration for Trump's politics so you got the other side of this\nYou know crediting Trump on the one hand would strategies with helping him open up a sports bar you know why he would put that up there in any way that seems a little odd and weird and\nUh but I think what we're dealing with somebody with a great instability is one is from MSNBC is Andrea Mitchell a promise to repay your door apply to your threats\nYou know we will answering coming to see you\nAnd uh with his arrest by the way it means one lunatic one maniac is off the streets thank God\nAnd um we uh we

bombs\nAnd from what we can determine they all had powder and them some type of electric some type\nOf electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to

of roughly six inches of PVC pipe [noise] a small clock\nA battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock were friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise] I Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI law\nBased on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing ... that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters [noise]\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is at ... or say\nThere is also a possible the connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes sample previously collected from ... in connection with an earlier arrest [laughter] down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure under an incredibly tight timeframe we see unbelievable work like this on TV and Ali would but to see it up close and reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab\nFor their work and keeping people safe helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation\nOf this DNA connection and we want to thank them in

turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day you know the sad thing about all of this you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that in a minute but you don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve\n... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported and uh people wanting to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans\nAnd Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him and I said that and just like I said in\nThe years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and as it came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and that's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy the broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot on fake news CNN is named my ... what's his name John ... somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to the near wrote to me let's just played that part ... when he but basically blaming me listen to this I had and he said had a direct language\n... may have we don't we don't know who is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echo what an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative jets yeah but you know it's not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... or the Robert De Niro is calling the president devil in a devil worshippers in effect you know\nA piece of playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the tissue to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ... so you may sort of\nLeading a lame ing me because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a punk his dog he's a pig is a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care fix these gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best these uh\nJust text the word protect P R O\nT E C T to the number eight seven to two

and benefit policies to include elder care and offering flexibility to address things such as child care and transportation also wages are increasing as well including raises in sign on bonuses\nSo it really sounds like a job seekers market right now what else can you share\nCompanies are looking for ways to offer growth and development within the business versus having employees seek advancement opportunities elsewhere and this could mean offering training and educational system it's not just for the jobs here in but for future career auction\nOr it makes sense investing your workforce and

L. A. V.\nZero long eight hundred ... you're not going to get it\nThis is a double standard in the media you get conservatives who say you can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible because one of his ... supporters went out there and shot somebody but it's there there is an obsession\nTo always blamed conservatives for the actions of some of these ... cases and that appears to be the media talking point for the hour for the day here um you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America\nSafe you know when I when I go out there and say I'm not gonna go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders any shot up Republicans on a ball field the Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN\nAnd all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar\nThey've gone deep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with the Clintons there nobody that's Keith Ellison or Cory Booker it's always hypocrisy [noise]\nYou know you look at the hearing ... who's been warning that horrible things are going to happen if the

found is Sean Hannity was do we just\nHeard deniro and what the narrow was saying about the president our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all\nYou see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter in and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic bomber because he must've heard Sean Hannity playing the narrows own words calling the

wall\nThem build the wall enforce the law provides nearly twenty four billion dollars to keep the seat from Trump terrorism and gang violence but Democrats wants to protect criminals in sanctuary cities and sanctuary states no matter how many Americans are intact deals for become addicted that's the Democratic drink that we must die when you vote\nVote for Republican Congress how President

com\nAnd the Democrats gained thirty one she should have and if they gained thirty one sheets we've lost a majority and plus she's a speaker and that's why I'm a ... Speaker Gingrich\nHas got those odds and those are scary odds because of post she takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know she'll want to kill jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach president so\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop poetry and the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amount it's by big amounts so you have a tick rational race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia ten were barber construct running for reelection fewer saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point that had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in a center account I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolute ... so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the\nDemocrats if Locy become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they picked up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change to think of I think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the ah with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the judiciary\nCommittee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes illegal this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters\nWe get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys in for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election or you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nDon't want it or what I'm saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he is right to say that the Democrats\nAre mobilized can focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with the dirty secret\nIt's hot so much tunnel Trump that is a risk it's the Republicans in the house and Senate much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt the ... one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican houses there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races as negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website [noise]\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really dug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped a pay for Nineteen Ninety\nFour and September that had we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour far ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some saying the orange she has out raised a has outrage the uh uh uh Democrats their National Committee two to one of\nThe ... that money needs to find its way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats aren't spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop polo see we've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh\n... they've really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell fish out of power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state and I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations showed trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters you know Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... come critic lock for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the ... first before I'm a Democrat I Know John is certainly knew shot I just hope we stop demonizing doing what Maxine Waters and say\n... responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending that the ten or twelve arms around or vice versa plan that Democrats can we focus on our national or our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan watery\nBuilt building the wall and having a pathway to ...\nOkay so that that old trucker offered that deal to the Democrats that even had a dream it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't I was ... because I was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats that yes the goodness gracious I Would do that no heartbeat I think it makes sense or Don Lenny in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nOr Donnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically a giving a half a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble I think the biggest polling surprise that we saw in the last week was Joe Manchin down by two\nPatrick Morrisey was on this program yesterday that seemed like a potentially winnable race or class or the onion\nA mansion or when that will win a\nRail I felt the same thing or two but I Will tell you mentioned didn't vote for the tax cuts mentioned didn't vote for Gorsuch it appears that mansion had an election year can conversion by voting for Kavanaugh because he knows his career would be over and more importantly the economy was saved in West Virginia coal mining industry by Donald Trump not by mansion\nAnd I think ranch and did have an election near a conversion then that's all of the ...\nElection year hundreds and mean lets be a phony for for a couple of months they will go back to being the liberal we really are\nThat he's not really a liberal he's the most conservative Democrat\nNow literally live in this environment that means it's just not a super\nRadical you know left wing lunatics that's all that need I Will take a break we'll come back more John McLaughlin Doug shown are posters eight hundred nine four one showing us our number\nA we'll have the latest on what is going on in terms of this the suspect that they have now in custody\nAnd more details as they become available they've uncovered recovered fourteen suspicious packages addressed two prominent people will get to that\nOf course the blame game has been on since the first thing this morning and it's absolutely sickening the way especially CNN has been handling this and much more straight ahead right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections that turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why but there's your savings or tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy he's on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nThese races now the margins are just raised a razor thin or the race we're talking about here is literally forty six forty five ... known Claudia Tenney no for a long time she was a great congresswoman\nAnd uh she's in the fight for her life the twenty second congressional district in New York a toss up millions of dollars being spent up in and around the entire region a which is northern north of New York city in and around the Syracuse area\nAnd she joins us now uh Syracuse dot com pulls a one point raised Claudia it can't get any closer and uh it's typical of a lot of races that are going around around the country Audi pulled us out\nYeah it's tough it's not the race just from my life it for the people that live here it's for protecting the tax cuts\nThe one time we finally got a real tax cut direct money into the pockets of the people that live here instead of all of that high taxes and spend that we've received from Albany under Governor Cuomo I'm a progressive socialist and ... and New York city that basically run our ... our state and my opponent is one of them

City\nBread Hi how are you glad you called sir I've shown us of all cocaine Michael yeah it was I'm a little worried about the\nPanhandle and as much as you know a lot of people who've been displaced were in the middle of early voting the panhandle is crucial to the entire state of Florida you have two very tight races you got the sand is running for governor and you've got Rick Scott running for senator\nAnd if the people that have been displaced can't get back and vote that's going to be problematic uh for the sand distance gotten any chance they have a winning\nWhile that's what I'm calling to urge my fellow and adults to get out and vote which are both Governor Scott needs are but they're hoping that will be too busy for doing recovery than to get out\nWell in Florida early voting is ongoing so that means you can go any time between as I understand that now and election day um I Know it's hard especially for people some people have lost their everything they've lost their entire home they'd been relocated\nAnd they don't have a chance to change their voter registration probably so that means that have to go back to where they live in or they can get an absentee ballot I don't think it's too late for that to eleven days but you'd have to check in with your local elections office\nYes that's correct I saw it on the news the other day about ... still viable but\nI mean lean courage everybody to get out and vote\nYeah just called your local elections office having to send you an absentee ballot if you're not there if you can get back in and vote obviously you know Rick Scott won both races only by one percent I mean Gillum is now up which would does it scares the daylights out of me based on you know his agenda [noise]\nAnyway I Hope the er an all our best to our friends in the panhandle we know you've been through a lot and ah our prayers in thoughts are with you as you begin to rebuild it was very tough for a lot of people [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchased wander\nAnd when he was in Congress\nWell you know what the central issue right now is and my opponent has made it a central issue because he was trying to buy\nOnto the Bernie Sanders wing party has committed in so things like\nHow 'bout sanctuary for illegal alien criminals how about giving Medicare to people who are here illegally and when we see this is hello this is a group of thousands of the legal heading towards our border\nThey've been listening to the Democrats promising them a benefits in jobs that should go to the American people\nKnow even Daryl I so who's retiring his district I think it's the forty ninth and southern orange and northern coastal la San Diego area that that is that in trouble or is that coming back\nI'm afraid that that's coming factors as a uh well actually I'm afraid that the candidate and heart is in trouble there but you know what counts as not poll before and was counts as a poll on election day I'm\nA white man heart out to oppose tax increases in California's immigration sanctuary law but the state right\nWing right [noise] well no what it is it's it's frankly a just a personal issue on her and her family and and the Democrats certainly know how to use personal issues they know how to use name calling thing that they they basically ... every time you disagree with one of them\nYou you end up car races are not fear and this is what are the way at least I Believe the true people who are\nA bit off maybe they're ... psychologically the rangers or something but when they hear the left wing calling out Nazis and calling us racist and ...\nAnd how many people like I Am watching than others publicly saying that we should be a semi dated them be\nAcosta while we're eating restaurant the Democrats never plainly about that and it gives these nut cases a an an idea\nHouse Duncan hunters district looking I Know they went after him and his wife personally but he seems to be holding back\nUm his opposition is struggling to get any traction at one time Obama campaign worker he seems to be holding his lead in his district right that's a variety of ... congressional district in in San Diego in riverside county\nWell Duncan Hunter is a is a treasure and his people know that and\nUh they are she had some trouble or his treasure was not keeping the books right and got him in trouble and I understand my treasure part of the way for ... years ago stole two hundred thousand dollars for my campaign and left like jumping in Arbor so I Know that are people who are working\nFor a high like Lyndon draw manage my money half the time she has my credit card and all these bills come in for the trip abroad and I am I'm assuming she knows about it I just wanted to thank you for that Sean no problem\n[laughter]\nI got you got their full with that but he but he sold it on there how 'bout Republican incumbent Jeff Denham a former state senator air force veteran he's in a pretty tight race with Josh Harder um that's more in the Central Valley area how's that race\nGoing on with my we're all in tight races like like Denham has been again such a fantastic congressman for his own people he's watched out for them\nI got I have a couple of disagreements with him but the fact is I Know is energetic and will step forward and he will argue the case for his people\nAny time so it is and although he's being outspent but I'm sure I look I'm being outspent by six or seven to one and I mean Bloomberg gift you another four million dollars and the last review the campaign all of us we're facing now but when the public knows where we are\nLike er with Duncan Hunter they know drunk or not or if they don't ... they they know us personally and they know where I work trying to return to protect them we speak for them and the other people are just calling names and joined the liberal left line\nAll right well for those in Southern California all the seats that we're talking about ISIS old seat Duncan Hunter seat obviously the case of Dana Rohrabacher I mean these have been strong solid conservative voices now in your case or what for a couple of decades now in Congress and you're one of the few people that I wanted to stay there\nAre actually you know keep your promises and work hard for the people who had district so well I agree and I just wanted to look let us know if we can help at all as you go through the soil you\nYou are you are Sean and we all have to remember if we lose control of the house that's reduced seats means my election maimed the Democrats will grind our country to a halt there will be gridlock there will be all sorts of over temps to disrupt the person from getting anything done\nAnd we don't want to you don't want to disrupt us presidents for\nPresidents in any more than one collectors already done\nAll right thanks so much for being with us Dana Rohrabacher eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number by the way some angel families those families that have had loved ones killed by illegal immigrants in the country they are actually planning to go down proactively to the border to have to meet the caravan should they make it that far\nA let's get tore a busy phones will talk to them a let's say Hi to Donna is in Frederick Marilyn Donna Hi how are you glad you called eleven days away\nHi Shaun yeah I Can't wait to get out there and vote and I've got several people up in my mind in keeping pat ... we have to get out there this is such a referendum against the socialists and I've got a say in ... with the events they\nYou know these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess suspicious device is because we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe thinking I'm sure that that's been confirmed because they when they said they had powder I'm assuming that was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot of chart of glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nWell it's a different tact than you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um that bomb threats what concerned about is\nAs you mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the sticky jury as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Arlen who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be a connection between those little vigilance could there be more than one person\nIn this whole scenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the Tom family was threatened as well\nAs I've gone through a lot of this it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of ... I've I've shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career and frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it sadly is a part of being in the public eye and having a strong political views it's on it really is unfortunate\nUm but that's why I think\nWhat we should be able to tell her you should be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and\nApparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place\nOn this man this guy this background we have to find out if there were accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together uh people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this program and we're going to wait and see and when we know the truth will pass it on to you\nOr we can yeah ... we don't know\nYeah the truth matters and China I Want to say one other thing to do with respect to the invasion what concerns me about that and it's not really getting recorded much it's how many people\nAre sick and we have children dying from ... like illnesses now so what pocket and brain and that's another\nIssue I you know I'm concerned about\n[noise] yeah well look we gotta we always got to stay on top of all these diseases and stay ahead of it and thank God we have some brilliant scientists and doctors that work endlessly out a long hours every day that the save us\nUh All right we've got to take a break hey listen I Will tell you that my pillow changed my life it just works I Love it I Can't be without it I fall asleep faster I I stay asleep longer\nThat the Amazon dot com anti\nCardio among the guardian mobile fits\nIn your pocket but you can take it EKG anytime anywhere right when you\nFeel exempt cardio mobile delivers a medical grade Katie right to your smartphone and just thirty seconds you know your heart rate that it's normal for in a trio fair relation is detected water cardio mobile today protest Ninety nine dollars [noise] visit Amazon dot com anti party among [noise]\nTake unlimited ... morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio mobile like Lisa ... in your pocket for only ... died dollars ...
