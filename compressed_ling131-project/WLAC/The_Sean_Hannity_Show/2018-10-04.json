cats are defending Al Franken anyway we'll see in the political fallout of all of this now is Kavanaugh's now the president's approval rating is an all time high at fifty percent today and\nThe president laying out the facts in this particular case we've got an election in thirty three days\nAnd every poll is now showing that the Senate races in the enthusiasm gap is heightened dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood Janine all in a process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on in thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place they don't seem to care\nAt all at what they've done with judge Kavanaugh or when you look at the evidence and you look at\nThe facts as the FBI did now they're attacking the FBI what do you find out is that there is zero corroboration\nTo the claims of all three women in the ... not even including\nThe cases of outright lying that were dismissed early on about judge Kavanaugh\nThey just dismiss it altogether but none of this whatever may get into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some other people based on what Alan Dershowitz and others saying should happen\nBecause of the things that they said the backtracking that took place and perhaps even lying\nUnder the threat of a felony anyway news roundup information overload our Jonathan Gillum author or sheep no more Danielle McLaughlin is with us um I don't know if this was going to impact the election and thirty three days but I think it certainly has energized\nEvery every part of the Republican coalition that recognizes this for the grave injustice that it's banned in the smear campaign that it's been Jonathan\nWhy Korea and you know I think this has definitely caused um some good reactions and conservatives across this nation I'm also a free thinking or people who used to subscribe to the Democrats\nAre the Democrats' way of thinking are are now saying this is this isn't really politics this is\nI'm kind of criminal behavior the way a wad of this stuff is playing out in Washington DC right now or whether it be the talk thing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and I think what's happening is\nIt's solidify and people that they don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome in the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west um they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nAre you going to defend Europe ... liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\nThat's right he had to show on on the could opt in Ninety everybody excited to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be a backlash on the left as well you know um they are concerned about ah the nominee either continue this basic I wasn't\nDown cave but others say anyway hurdle we've heard all the allegations you know that professor Ford's so called by witness was contradicted her testimony and our accusation we know in the case of missed Vermeer is the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because\nThey discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one number to our own words that she was a ... quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow your classmates times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug gr and rapists the teenage girls so give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't Hammond hall that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I don't mind it was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week [noise] wait a minute\nAnd everybody's talking wanted was a full and fair and ... get married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I didn't know and if I had to\nUse I mean why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of missed for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect the next day and I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happen that way at all\nSo the judges are college roommate and staying on at the last twenty four hours a day looking about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do short timeline get something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but I also have to leave that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair investigation and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge ... and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know it's not talking point what was on a second once you interview looking in the case of professor Ford\nInvestigative facts there are none and there's not going to be any because it doesn't matter\nUh who you question the very people that uh the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime\nDon't know anything and so as you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or heard here say it becomes here say\nYou know that from being in court that when you have a just eight minutes\nWith no corroborating evidence\nThe case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally and the the the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the that's the thing that took ...\nI'm a governments do\nAgree I think that one thing that's important to cut back to this was a standard here this is not\nA criminal investigation uh this is an investigation and to conduct that may or may not have bearing on way there's somebody get lifetime appointments and and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extreme like political and extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\nAnd yelled is an important question do you have any corroborating witness for\nAny corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat have been on the question that has an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... well I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is I Want you to make question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her ... pm but in this case there's just no other witnesses there is no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something if somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that much intimate question because there is not and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have ... ... it would be them\nRight and on the side there is no primary evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I think I think people are unless you know for for ...\nAnybody actually has a copy of is summer calendar that year but we don't have an exact day anyway so\nRight right and you know what you're saying is that you know he has to prove his innocence or is the innocent before proven to be ... they haven't been proven guilty what what do you believe in is innocent until proven guilty again this is so he hasn't been proven guilty and you know has he he has not been proven guilty and it's gone on a long time\nNot to a legal standard that would be required ... absolutely not but I don't believe that it's a stand if yeah and I write\nThank you both we appreciate it eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number final our free for all we're going to get to your calls next eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the progress [noise]\n\nA report on Brett Kavanaugh and ... even yeah talking about a morning radio Ninety you\nKnow\nDriving in those liberals Sean Hannity is back on the radio right now by twenty five now till\nThe top of the hour eight hundred nine put one Sean is our toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program All right so this vote Friday Saturday big votes big opportunity\nAnd we have Susan Collins and senator snowflakes saying that they are satisfied that the comprehensive investigation of the FBI Lisa Murkowski saying the hasn't had time to read it\nDemocrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI\nWere they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever gonna be enough All right back to our phones as we say Hi first Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up and spent most of my life in Arizona where my family still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds sounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a see\nGood people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like that's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not um I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know is old mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you don't look at him and uh you'll find this funny Sean but we were actually related I think it's our three or four generations back our great great something grandfather it was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nKnow somebody told me that yesterday I'm practically really no there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm I Hope it goes the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they are going to do is give you straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward\nIn terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark um I was having a conversation with a friend of mine is religious and we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that's ... that's why to the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh\nThey do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I
