ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and create a crowd and when you create a crowd follow them into the department\nStores and restaurants and gas stations what do you think it's going to happen\nWhen those types of things are set and I'm not look at the end of the day people who are responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this was going to look back here and Rand Paul's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed in all of this\nAnd we'll get a look at the signs and symptoms were all there and we'll think about Pam Bondi and what happened to her secretary Nielsen and what happened to her and we'll think about oh other things like uh oh Sarah

I. lazy [noise]\nCanada not start with the biggest\nNews of the day it looks like Senator Warren released the results of her DNA\nTesting I Do I have this done with the ancestry dot com I did a long time ago and you just give them some of your DNA some of your saliva think hair I forgot what I did\nAnyway um and I turned out I was a hundred percent British child in other words Irish I had known all for my grandparents had come from Ireland a hundred percent is kind of rare but whatever\nUm anyway so loaded with Warren has released a DNA test that provide strong evidence that she had a Native American and her family dating back six to ten generations\nNow what it means is if you interpret it if our great great great grandmother was Native American that would put her at one\nThirty second American indian\nBut the report includes the possibility that he's only won\nFive hundred and twelve Native American up the ancestor goes back ... generations analysis apparently done by Carlos boost the Monday from Stanford University professor expert in the fields Aaron Lee won some big twenty ten MacArthur Fellowship known as a um\nYou know a genius grant for his work on tracking population migration with DNA Analysis you know he said that the vast majority of warns ancestry is European the problem is is that when she was at Harvard the time that she was there and I believe one other University She was teaching at\nIs she was listed as Native American and that that's how they you know promoted her\nAs she got hired that way there was one report that said Harvard says they didn't hire because I've been to other words they're billing her as a better term\nAs Native American and if it's one in five hundred and twelve he's not really Native American and she'd let that go on for ever and ever and ever now maybe in an effort to\nGet rid of the issue before her run for president in twenty twenty I guess that might be one of the reasons\nI'm All right when we come back we're going to go over all the latest poll numbers Democrats advised not to speak about um popular open border policies or they can't talk about impeachment then can't talk about open borders what can they can't talk about taking the crumbs back what can they talk about it's all one big lie [noise]\n\nLean to\nBreaking news straight from the stores this is the Sean Hannity\nShow you don't think that climate change is [laughter]\nSo I think something's happening something is changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um [noise] I don't want to give trends and religions have dollars I don't want to lose\nMillions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nI Wish you could go in Greenland [noise]\nAh watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean or anything to the level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know when you're a scientist and your scientists have long said disagree with that you know I I think he\nMight have had now I've seen the hurricane situations I changed my mind and really in climate change and I thought what an impact [noise]\nWhat am I I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about it on that and they said that we had hurricane that were far worse than\nWhat we just sat with Michael says that they were saying what if I'm a scientist who say it's worse than having a\nShow me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda Leslie cancelling them just also have a political agenda\nWhere was it Angola the the altered climate change data it's science was as the Al Gore and others would tell you if it was so surely perfect is no disagreement than the scientific community it's just not true why would they have to alter the data back at that time\nBy the way the job of starting soliciting and he heard that he's about to lose his mind uh why do I know and the president was down visiting the devastation left by Michael ... hurricane you call that a thousand percent right I think up to now we've lost Nineteen people is the latest number I've heard but\nYou know thankfully most people listen and got out\nA job of stories with weather bell dot com that that annoyed you I Know right\nChain of all of my my interviews the ... she went to debate the president she didn't want to interview the president she wanted to debate them\nFirst of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had\nNear record snowfall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold periods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties\nAnd nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal skillful and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently\nShe's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica so so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking high about five six years ago and they came down below in their back you know normal now let me let me say this\nIs the president answer the question perfectly here's why up until now climate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now or\nYou know whether anybody else better than anyone else I mean okay but when you look back at the earth temperature as it go out and cooler and then warmer in the warmer and then cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me get Leslie for\nIf if she lets thing if you're listening motive for examples intensified bore rapidly that Michael right off the top of my head Nineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine\nCame a lemon days across the Atlantic is a tropical wave forty eight hours later a category five hurricane fill your with a hundred and eighty mile an hour wind gusts Corpus Christi went from a hurricane a category one to a category four in the twenty four hours coming into Corpus Christi Nineteen Seventy\n... in Nineteen sixty nine went over there and talk like ship with a hundred and twenty five mile an hour winds thirty\nSix hours before fifty mile an hour tropical storm and that's way up in the north Atlantic they're countless examples\nRapid feedback development it was a textbook case for it and it's amazing watching this go on in front of my eyes of people say how did this happen ... ... it's right out of my classes at Penn State Nineteen Seventy in the Nineteen seventies\nSome today had said he should have stepped down ... member just that\nHere you know she's defending him all she wants but that doesn't address Juanita Broderick Kathleen William Paula Jones and are saying the bill did not abused his power how can you say he's an intern is classic workplace sexual harassment because he's got all the power he's the president\nOr whatever I mean I don't know why Hillary so define on the issue but she is\nUm so we got the ... let me tell you what's going to happen though one twenty two days because I think this is important\nWe have a CBS News battleground poll showing that the house races are in a statistical tie my advice to you is to think three weeks from tomorrow you're going to turn on the TV and get bad news because maybe that will motivate you and the agenda simple impeach investigate\nOpen borders eliminate ice they want their crumbs back they want Obamacare what else do you really need to know\nAnyway they find that the battleground states the race for control the house is now within the margin of error which means a statistical tie\nThe same CBS survey finds that for Democrats to when they have to rely on voters who say that they're going to vote this year but did not turn out in the twenty ten or twenty fourteen midterms\nIf the elections are held today Democrats would stand to win two hundred and twenty six seats they claim more than a two hundred and Eighteen needed for the majority Republicans winning the remaining two hundred nine but the margin of error and each of those it's tight why keep mentioning names on Hannity every night non Hannity dot com\nMarsha Blackburn has pulled out of a bigger lead against Brett is and I have to believe the tape that was put out by project very causes putting\nSome a highlight on that you know the new rock star of the Democratic party ... got something like sixty million dollars these thrown at Ted Cruz but Ted Cruz is still up by eight I'm going to be in the Houston area on Saturday of this coming week I'm going to do a town hall\nWhich ought to be fun uh we have just a two point lead for Heller and unimportant raised versus Rosen in Nevada I mean ... that's an important seat to hold\nIn the case with Arizona mix ... finally taken a lead there I've got to believe that her leads going to get bigger once it begins to resonate\nWhat a cinema has been saying about people in our own state whenever she travels abroad or if you look at some of these other you know districts it's very very tight I honestly can't tell you what's gonna happen in twenty six states like a twenty to twenty two days I Can't tell you\nBut I Will tell you got to personalize this election\nI mean Nancy Pelosi look at her is that who you're voting for voting for a Democrat that say if you vote for senator that's a Democrat you're voting for Chuck Schumer and there are radical left agenda interviewed well if you want to know what it's between lower\nTaxes less government intervention you know there's a fascinating piece on the Drudge Report what do you think just in the top of your mind the top one what is it one thousand if I can find it for a hundred and nine taxpayers the richest one thousand four hundred and nine taxpayers and America\nWell guess what\nThat the one thousand four hundred nine taxpayers pay more taxes\nThan the bottom Seventy million Americans the top three this according latest information coming from a Bloomberg and it's a year twenty sixteen but individual taxes\nAre paid by thinking about this the top three percent pay the majority of everything the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes and literally than the bottom Ninety percent one percent pays more than Ninety percent\nThe top fifty percent pay all the taxes Ninety seven percent we have redistribution\nThe bottom fifty percent of Americans only pay three percent of the bill that's it the individual income tax system is designed to be progress if it is\nIt is redistribution of wealth we already have the system and then when you get a little bit of your crumbs back because the ... the only ones that are getting problems back or people that pay you know but for the middle class that's a lot of money one in two thousand dollars and they say you want the crumbs back as ridiculous so there's a lot\nGoing

was careful for Hillary Clinton he was capital for\nA ... group he was involved there this this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name\nAlong with you know or in Simpson and all these others\nAnd the Democrats win back the house 'cause they know at that point all these investigations will will close they'll shut them down they'll stop 'em in their tracks and then the witch hunt against Donald Trump begins anew and they'll try to impeach the president\nAnd then if we get some somebody without ... started to get in the Justice Department they can do a criminal investigation there's also criminal I mean civil litigation that's possible\nFor example Carter Page said discovery in a case that Carter Page could bring would open up all kinds of information about what what\nHow long would that discovery take 'cause I Know Carter Page is moving forward with the lawsuit\n[noise] well it it just depends on the ... where you where you file the case are there it's a slow docket or rocket rocket docket but none of this Shawn without the ... puts it the cooperation of the media without those journalistic with David Corn and Mike is it cost\nCutting out the information just regurgitate in the information that they receive from uh the people who were doing this behind to see\nI I Can't believe that there's not enough outrage to realize what is actually going on here\nIs you have a ... a a series of reports put together known as the dusty by Christopher Steele\nThat's Hillary Clinton DNC funneled money through a law firm ... hiring fusion GPS and research firm then they hire Christopher Steele and they put together unverified uncorroborated in mostly now what turns out to be debunked information Joe diGenova\nFirst they use it to hurt Donald Trump and the general election you know the stories about you know Russian hookers urinating into bad in a in a mosque out rich Carlton for example that's all being leaked even by high members within our intelligence community for the purposes\nOf influence in the election with a with a series of lies and propaganda then the same information is used again to create a special counsel and to really deal legitimize and hopefully dismantled the presidency of Donald Trump that's when it came down to\nWell there's no doubt about it a shot on that but as Victorian I have been saying now for Eighteen months there was a brace a plot\nBrazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally and that if she lost the election to praying Donald Trump and that is exactly what they did these people were motivated by an Anna this\nCourt Donald Trump which led them to fabricate evidence to foreign intelligence services fabricate evidence wiretapping medical ... and and when they found exculpatory evidence for example\nThat would have paper George Papadopoulos they hit it from the by the court there is no doubt\nThat number people John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and the jets\nAnd Rod Rosenstein cannot figure out a way to do that and by the way John Huber ... Utah at the head fake\nDoing nothing six months without report I've let the Brady Bunch of indictments tomorrow use what an outrage with Russia has been ... by tolerated either the credits waited till after the election to get rid of them and I say to hell with both of them All right\nThank you what's going to happen Jason ... you see a new attorney general down their own\nThoughts soon it off I just put up a piece that I wrote about sessions can't go soon enough worthless you there in name only the really should be is\nThat a second special counsel to look into Brandon and all these cast of characters we've been talking about over the last few minutes they did the president needs that employees\nWell ear hair president make a decision himself\nYeah absolutely you could push that for a ... and and releasing the documents to Congress absolutely\nYeah I think all that needs to happen or orange twenty two days before the election we'll see what goes on from here a thank you all for being with us eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number what happened to the Washington Post reporter uh Jamal shirt or cause showed the um\nAccusations that the Saudi crown prince is involved in the murder of this journalist will get into that also have the latest on the rioting that took place over the weekend both in Portland in New York City and much much more as we continue busy Newsday here on the Sean Hannity show only twenty two days to election day [noise]\n\nUp to the end of the day Ramsey show later today\nOn TALK radio Ninety eight point three\nW. L. A. C.\n[noise]\nThis is what's right with America you're listening to Shaun Hannity show\nChallenger sunlight and got on the phone and asked the press [noise] what can I ask\nThem they deny it denied every way you can imagine in the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer\nWhat are your options let's say they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators proposed what depends\nOn what the sanctions or give me an example they order a military equipment\nEverybody in the world one in that order Russian wanted at China wanted it we want it is we got it and we got all of it every that events on would you cut that off why well when I don't want to do going Latino race here and all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of a\nLot of ... teams a word that's a pretty harsh orphanage true\nHow everybody what to do care you know that there's a lot\nOf ... there's a lot at stake and maybe especially so because this man was a reporter to something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really\nTerrible in disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see what's going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nBy the way the president on sixty minutes last night talking about the mysterious this appearance of this reporter Jamal ... uh we have some new updates for you on it it looks like the Saudis are preparing to admit that he was killed in ...\nInterrogation gone wrong I'll get to that in a second we do have other breaking news\nUh twenty five now to the top of the hour glad you're with us\nIt looks like in Maine the Bangor police department along with the fire department and the local hazmat crew are on site at Susan Collins is Maine home investigating a suspicious package\nThe state's criminal investigation division is also assisting at the ongoing probe and reports of the alleged threat came after Cohen's ah course\nGave a key vote as it relates to confirming justice cabin on to the U.S Supreme Court prior to the voter office was they luge with threats against the senator and her staff\nIn one case the person didn't leave a name and number they threatened to literally rape one of my young female staffers ... quoted in the wall Street Journal\nLast weekend Collins returned to Maine after Kavanaugh was sworn into office and address the media regarding her decision and she told reporters the supplemental FBI report that she pushed for\nWas a turning point that help to reach the decision to support cabin on despite\nThe accusations that were leveled against him she actually gave due process\nUm I've had this happen to me white powder sense of my office one side and the system that has been\nWhat the the varying rest of the day in a panic state in isolation because of this white powder you know these things that people do and in some cases it's actually real as in the anthrax case\nUh one other news about this more news on the Senate before we get to the issue of cars shaggy a in Georgia you know this blue wave is a midterm election is apparently according to a Georgia gubernatorial candidate saying well that's going to include illegal aliens\nBut the thing of it is the blue wave is African American as white as Latino it's Asian Pacific Islander is disabled this differently abled it's L. V. I. L. GB T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are the candidates said\nAnd then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who are told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp\nTelling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia and said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in a gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Chris than a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... Sally one of the important races that were following and how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and\nAll the Washington Examiner apparently found emails that show cinema herself inviting a prominent group\nI'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely show they were really to aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened I'm\nIn a constellation I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical rule imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that there's this ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage rate the fact that this individual offers so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nHighly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians with their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly\nTried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were ... they had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah yeah\nThat's the thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just set\nIt seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they like the president and the president came out and said the king and then some on the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale and something that we do not elevate it looks like they didn't like it the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul\nYou spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean ... there's been a women I\nChronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and being told how to dress a being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up if you left\nIf you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under the sharia there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWas modernization and Saturday we felt when then being able to drive we saw the ... what the government that I had to wear called the ... I think you were sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major U.S team and central\nSeen people dress observant link but it's such a great clean shown that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it it has been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to ... for many years and and this and this new\nThere also are precedents that relates to Judaism and Christianity and lesbians or either slogged or killed is not true\nAbsolutely him but that's for me what's so unfortunate about\nThis incident and why I Hope it gets corrupted\nVery quickly is that we were actually thinking of modernization that seem liquor or you know I'm I'm more liberal or such to women's rights limits education when driving and that played the crown prince had such\nGood around the world because he was taking a different approach to really saddens me to see them go so far backwards from what was really an ... last year to change things\nRight last words ...\nYeah Morgan's right they were trying to diversify the economy get away from a strictly Petro dollars\nAnd I mean this is an enormous enormous step back on\nYou know there there there's no covering this up if they have to admit that they did this ...\nAnd the details of this come out there was a terrific as we think there's going to be some explaining to do I just encourage everybody to keep the whole global picture in mind here uh when doing it we can't start World War three over this although some there has to be a some form of a upcoming clean by the Saudis some form of retribution there's no\nDoubt that they want to pass it on to people and the consulate and I don't believe for a second that they didn't know\nOr at least the crown prince did no sooner than this uh All right thank you all pre shit it\nUh Morgan Ortega and are are good friend a dam bond Gino eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number next hour by the way we've got a lot

I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're gonna have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ...\nGet to walk the halls without what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations own and I met her\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ...\nYeah but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now I always said about Obama the number one leave his kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did\nAnd I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents\nAnd I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear\nWhat I don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again look first of all you're ignoring the wishes of non violent protests phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you're if you're going to be ignoring examples of Donald Trump really\nWhen people were stood up and kept saying I got to hurt and if you know I'll defend you in court don't worry about it and you talk marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing has happened no nothing so sort of like well what I was saying oh no no no no if you want me to answer the\nQuestion I didn't take that as is the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing that is now happening with the Democratic party and by the way I have the evidence of me saying about\nObama only play I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I\nMiss the speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down a secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah\nYou're welcome Sally called ...\n... ... here's what I think we agree on violence is that I Hope\nThere is also a very very visible pattern Cohn at ... at the comet of Donald Trump I'll beat the crap out of ... part of the problem is nobody wants to hurt you want it anymore and the good old days the rest of them I treat them very very rough\nFirst of all fair about both sides in the Senate

brawls or not I won't support them\nThat's right I agree too now whether a group we're getting into a group of a hate group has to do with its ideology and what\nI mean why can't you don't have that many places or should we care you've heard of\nProud Boys which is supposed to be I I read a male chauvinist group um and the that's the first time you've heard about a first time I've heard about him
