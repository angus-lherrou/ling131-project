incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind of nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals who agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision and I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people

important\nAre joining us now a a real New Yorker in his own right a former NYPD police commissioner a Bernie ... is with us a call commissioner a commission thank you for being with us Dr Sebastian Gorka is what I was struck by the way his new book is that why we fight\nOr defeating America's enemies with no apologies thank you both for being here you know Bernie ...\n... you know I listen to Hillary yesterday\nCompared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worst governor of New York history say conservatives he they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I can do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they say no e pluribus owned them and I'm like you're so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president then making these choices\nAre as you know Sean was much I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck branded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought it was a good idea\nThe general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be\nA and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president's\nI just think it's bizarre I'd say ... way over the top I think\nThey're going to get laid when that happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left in they'd send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers\nChase me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me but you know what an office enough already ... listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh\nThis is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and Brennan where at the max dividing uh ... the audience that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka ... nobody ever\nIt's not being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House\nUm it's been Hollywood that wants to punch the president in the face and showing separate heads of the president\nAnd those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives in you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here I've been saying for weeks now going back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress\nSomebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and lo and behold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up\nAnd then those people that were silent when it's a Republican now or oh this is outrageous we can't have those kind of rhetoric and this is this is horrible he can't pay fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the left who it is\nCNN anybody tell me which Republican which member abide by the media or the political leadership made political profit\nFrom a Bernie solve is willing to shooting Steve ... which Republican member of the the pop the all the media\nProfit to personally profit for his side of the rice and off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family members of the cabinet off the individuals were\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA director how all all had rice and mailed to them\nBy the way I've had white powder mail to ... a ... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has to go through we all want to catch him as ever responsible here\nAre but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would know as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK\nWhy is it okay for CNN to run high runs today blaming Donald Trump for not taking responsibility for these are tempted letter bombs why is that okay when one Republican profited from congressmen actually getting shot that at a baseball field very close to where I Am spending about\nBy left wing activist this is this is the double standards that the average American see through and this is why we're going to vote down to get Republicans on November to six because they had enough of the lives of the double standards\nKnow it's the same thing burning and I agree with Sebastian that you know it showed a lot of courage what you did yesterday but I've known you so long I Know that's who you are\nAnd it comes so second nature to you you don't even think about it I got to take a quick break more with NYPD Commissioner Bernie Carrick more with Dr Sebastian Gorka and more of your calls and then later on\nCongresswoman hopefully soon to be senator from tennis\nAnd it just shows what hypocrisy exists in the media to me\nIt but you know what Sean I I think the American people either Democrats even people on the left in New York City people are coming up to be constantly ... you know what I've had about this is insane their rhetoric that left wing rhetoric tax verbal attracts calling for\nBasically violets your Eric Holder the former attorney general the United states calling for acts of violence against Republicans a Maxine Waters below sea you know like a ... Sebastian Gorka just mentioned a skull least\nNobody match Scully yesterday\nAn attempted assassination of the United states congressman on that Virginia ball fields nobody's talked about that you\nKnow what I Know that they don't hire about it I mean the only reason those guys are alive today and this goes to something I Know this is near and dear to your heart\nIs because you had to Capitol police officers that did what probably their training told them not to do and that is they walk in an open field with pistols going up against a rifle\nA and a guy hidden behind a barrier now that basically ... is is a suicide mission to save someone else's life that's how brave watch\nList that these men and women do it all the time it's just like the better when did this just be a joint terrorism task force now or the FBI the New York city police this New York state police\nOr they're going to go out there a risk their lives to file personal responsible for it to buy says no I I Want to practice that if the devices are real\nI I don't know I I'm I'm starting to have a a a real inkling that\nThese may not be real devices I'm ... and if that's true\nUm where a lot better off nobody's going to get hurt but I find it really suspicious that you've got eight or nine of these things so far it usually the trigger mechanism for these devices is the actual opening of the package well there's been several open and none of them have detonated which tells me\nThere some sort of problem so I Hope it they're not real um and I hope that the the authorities find them sooner or later I think\nThe ... billion in cuts search go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that it ... none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolutely by said yesterday you all have you know probably twenty four to Seventy two hours a day in and I stand by that there's not nor nor nor much some enormous amount of evidence\nThat there have been able to capture because these things to knock that day and I think we'll see something so All right Dr ... you'll be all last word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we a release of how we throw the book at them but it doesn't matter what side you're on the the responsibility for the normalization of violence as started\nOn the left when you have a former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they're down you kick them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil off do we win the election nobody on the right says that it's the left responsible if you could ...\nI Want to thank you both a Dr Sebastian Gorka congrats by the way I knew or knew best seller why don't you fight defeating America is a enemies with no apologies and over and YPG commissioner Bernie carry you also wrote the grave above\nA the grave and that too is are selling well thank you so much for being with us Bernie eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number if there's any chance of a great night on election night twelve days from now it has to be starting in Tennessee with the wind by Marsha Blackburn we'll get to that and much more straight ahead\n\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall us today in letting it get started\nEighty one to an end of the day Ramsey show later today on TALK radio Ninety eight point five Fifteen in W. L. A. [noise]\nDriving the liberals Sean Hannity is back on the radio right now\nLiberal Democrats promised to in the late president ... or to imagine gives him a ... or ... traders siding with Obama and Clinton we no\nOf Iran's again [noise] original mentioned do that\nMemory election empowers the liberal or tried to impeach\nThe president had to his money to protect residents from\nPatrick or see and I approve this message Patrick Morrisey working class roots dead wood roof mom it'd be a nurse worked his way through school\nAs well you\nNo drugs loan ... good luck when you supported Obama including the current drugs when he pushed his gun control bill to us by supporting taxpayer funded abortions\nThe only one candidate for his head was or what the heck Moore's\nOr see and I approve this message or a day go twenty five now till the top of the hour only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I and phone into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I had been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good vote with the right thing to do um but with that had um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations is seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worries during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nAnd it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have you know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe mansion on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you\nI spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration\nUh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally\nTo go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court and you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment\nThere couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nAre coming up news roundup information overload our Sean Hannity show Marsha Blackburn and our next hour Daniel McLaughlin and Jonathan Gillum

favorites\nYour view\nOn radio Ninety eight point\nAnd as we can anymore the Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure the left and liberal for you know they really are and um uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead\nNow but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal or replace much any more I was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way pre existing conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a pre existing condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber outlets Seventy in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in and pharmaceuticals or even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack at cancer or a bad car accident and you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you get great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... concierge medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been of Asian\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient\nSo there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute but does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida real little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on and Nevada\nUh we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Christ in ... now no problems with Americans joining Jean ... and and joining the Taliban then of course we've got Montana tester has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly is case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three\nBob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night second big surprise of the night is Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know the the state uh most worried about to be very honest as Florida\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if uh\nThere was a lot of wind going on as it happens every two and four years and our job is to keep you aware of it\nAh anyway one of the races we're watching very very closely is the great state of Tennessee at the end of the program is now leading in the polls tennis or Tennessee congresswoman Marsha Blackburn um when you saw the tape of a British ... staff\nCalling the people of Tennessee ignorant what was your reaction\nI looked at it and I said well you really think and this is typical liberal they try to hide and then somebody figures out exactly what it is that they are saying so there you go now you know\nMade a decision about a Supreme Court judge justice for political ... that was it\nI I'm looking I'm surveying the country right now this is how I see the Democratic party they\nThey only want to talk about Russia collusion if it's Donald Trump they don't care at all the Hillary we now know bought and paid for Russian wise to disseminate to the American people before the election that those lies or the the\nBulk of information to secure Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate they lived and committed fraud before the court and then they use that to set up a special counsel by leaking that information they're leak media league strategy but does that apparently was their\nTheir insurance policy when people like Peter Struck a saying that Hillary should win a hundred million is zero\nAnd I'm Wondering why don't they care about Hillary's Russian allies why do they not care about Keith Ellison ...\nYou know charges against him nobody is asking for FBI investigation into him and in that case we have tape syntax and in doctors' reports or the recent charges against Spartacus Cory Booker\nUm and it's the same on every other issue you know all the you know we have all these Democrats talking violently about the president Republicans on these mobs and ... most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right say oddly skill at things which is a double standard and it doesn't matter what the issue is whether it's something the legislative leave that we're working on or something that is political and Sean what they want to do is say look\nOur our outcome our ends justifies the means that we're using to go about this to get to where we want to go and that is not the way\nTennessee I'm ... I Want to see ... tennis fans want to say fairness and trees and respect for others and respect for differing opinions and as long as she respect for the rule of law and abiding by the constitution and what we have\nWith fish are resistant ... face and focus Democrat Party is oh well that ends will justify whatever means sit where they were using and people are appalled at how they are conducting themselves\nI saw the British ... first reaction to the tape of ah his staff calling people of the people of Tennessee ignorant and by the way Tennessee happens to be one of my favorite states Nashville like right at the my top three cities in the country and I\nWill not because they all ... they love you in Nashville, Tennessee you\nWell I mean even bigger I live ... miles south of Nashville are just off a psychiatrist Dr and I used to go up to Nashville all the time I I Love music city\nAnd I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were pretty insulted a and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff are I'm sure that ah he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether they were not but of course you know didn't they start saying well if it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project their toss project\nBut they started saying well all these other excuses but the point as they got caught they got caught\nSaying we made this decision because we want to go full people about where he is don't worry he's got to be a good kept crap when he gets there\nSo you got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when your kids do something wrong my kids do something wrong\nWhich rarely happens ah kidding but uh you know what it's not I'm I'm never as bad as what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble not a little trouble I don't care what it is\nI can deal with a mistake I Can't deal with you lying to me in looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my lines of my kids is\nYou know I I'm not stupid stop treating me like I Am stupid\nI'm right at first is frustrated I Swear to God I Swear and when you know darn well they did it that\nWell that is true and\nIn any of our relationships whether it's family members or does\nThat we work with us or wearing church organizations with we expect them to tell us the choice to have that integrity [noise] ah to speak the truth and when you don't then it causes are raft and that is what you're seeing with the brightest and campaigns\nAs people are saying that if she didn't mean it did you say and what people know about me is that they may not always agree with me but they are always going to know where I stand and that that is has been central\nTo me as a part of my public service and people expect that and\nI knew a long time a congresswoman and I know you'd make a great senator and I hope the people of Tennessee understand that um\nWhat are the issues because the economy's doing very well in Tennessee things are looking up we've had two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump's been president out of the people of Tennessee feel about the president's policies and\nAnd the important vote the boats that you will be casting that if you become the next grade senator from Tennessee\nIf people are so supportive of president Donald Trump and say look to see his policies succeeded they want to give my ... going to be a conservative and it's going to support president\nTrump and his policies Salem lore constitutional Supreme Court justices and federal judges they want to keep the\nTax cuts the economy is so good in Tennessee [noise] it has the fastest growing median household income and the southeast\nAnd Russ awesome fast for you to them that they deserve entree\nYes absolutely and I tell you something else building the walls securing that southern border and it was just caravan marching up through Guatemala and Mexico people are saying\nLook secure that border there's a right way and a wrong way to come to the United states we've among people to come to the right way respect the rule of law\nYou know what Congress owner of that wall was up I'm very concerned because we have to protect our or constitutional republic we've got we're based on the rule of law we have borders sovereignty issues here\nIf they ever get we have the wall up nobody would be marching they would be following the law and the proper process and necessary vetting if they want to come and visit or maybe even come and say we don't care where you come from we just need to know you you are\nSomebody that accepts our values wants to be a part of our family and doesn't\nHave any intentions to cause any harm or doesn't need assistance to the minute you get here\n[noise] that's right and I've been in Paris, Tennessee today and Camden and I'm telling you Sean that is what people say this is why we need the wall this is why we need to make certain that sanctuary city policies are ended because\nWe want to protect our communities without it every town to border town in every town supporters state and I've been with some of our shares some of our mayors some of our state legislators today and every single one of them say you know Marsha\nWe need to secure the southern border now mark gangs let's stop this no more traffic curse drug traffickers human traffickers sex traffickers\nBlessed terrible our let me ask you how to get our arms around this\nAre we going to take a quick break we'll come back more with congresswoman hopefully soon to be

soon to be senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee I've been telling people than bred as soon as one of them I mean and even you know this whole staff was caught on tape admitted as much but\nIf anybody in Tennessee where to vote for British and they're basically it would be the equivalent because he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer the Senate majority leader and I doubt that he's going to be whatever support a cabin on\nAnd he's going to go along with the resistance and they pretty much set as much and I think for the people Tennessee this was a clear choice election\nYou want your tax cuts do you want to make them permanent you want to keep them do you want to eliminate burdensome regulation and keep it that way do you want America to be energy independent you want to secure the southern border\nUm do you want the record low unemployment we have to continue you want an innovative help alternative healthcare alternative that will protect people with preexisting conditions a free market alternative maybe it's what Rand Paul wants block granting money to states or\nMaybe the cooperatives that I always talk about or maybe health savings accounts they want that and I think Americans like the security of\nYou know not dropping a hundred and fifty billion taxpayer dollars on the on the landing strip of with cargo planes full of cash and other currencies for a rainy among those the chant death to America I think they're happier with security we're better off than we were two years ago\nWell you're right and that's the question to say are asking them challenged because they want to get the Affordable CARE Act just a buck and open up the health insurance marketplace\nMake certain that they can buy health insurance they can afford and if they get a policy they like say that court abilities I can take it with them they feel reticent has supported\nGovernment run single payer health care he wrote a book about it all fresh Madison thinks that there ought to be a twenty percent\nSurcharge on your income to pay for government run health care he and Hillary Clinton share the same views on healthcare Tennessee and want to make certain that they keep\nThose tax
