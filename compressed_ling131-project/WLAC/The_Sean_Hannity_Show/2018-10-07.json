{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "And I teach people this because when you were able to show people the retirement road there on the truly exposure that if they continue on this course it's a crash course for a major market correction there's going to set them back and maybe even force them back out of retirement\nOr it's going to force them to pay such a high tax than in some people's case they're going to have to work or take a part time job just to pay the tax to sustain or maintain the lifestyle income they're looking for and folks just isn't fear mongering this is what almost a quarter century of having a front row seat with baby boomers\nI I've learned by having that front row seat of the very real challenges the boomers have and will continue to have if they don't get a complete plan and part of that plant starts with what's predictable well it's predictable folks that if we're nine and a half years in\nTo the longest Bull Run in history and no bull run as ever lasted ten years\nRight and you've got some of the biggest and brightest out there like a Warren Buffett saying the market will lose it will lose fifty percent plus and it will lose soon and you've got J. P. Morgan predicting when the financial crisis is going to hit\nAnd you've got the ... congressional budget office predicting how high federal tax rates are going to have to go which by the way is north of sixty three percent\nAnd we've got our own Social Security administration telling us that Social Security benefits are going to be cut by twenty twenty nine to the tune of about twenty nine percent\nAnd that's down from twenty thirty for folks and you've got Medicare saying that premiums are gonna have to continue to go up up up\nBut you've got a government that continues to spend spend spend right I Love the tax cuts the folks somebody's gonna have to pay for them and get to those of you that have saved money in tax deferred accounts you are the biggest tax target of the federal government and the reality is some people are the last to know it\nWill folks here's the opportunity\nThe way we helped Cindy and Jerry this week\nAnd you know they had a couple of the object is right one was to not outlived their money or to was to learn the key tax savings strategies that saved them the most tax because they to understand is not necessarily always about what you make it's what you keep and they didn't want to become a financial burden to their family because they each have taken\nA elderly parents one already through in one currently through\nAll farmers and dementia\nAnd folks if any of you listening I've ever had to do that it's a it's mentally exhausting and its financially devastating and the fact is our own health care is projected cost somewhere to the tune of about two hundred and eighty thousand or from age sixty five on many people are are woefully unprepared\nBut here's the good news by sitting in understanding exactly the retirement road Cindy and Jerry we're on\nWe're able to demonstrate for them what that road look like if it played out as it were\nBut we're also able to show them where the proper detours right or the bypasses that could be implemented that avoided unnecessary tax avoided unnecessary market loss exposure risk avoided losing purchasing power to inflation I'll talk to you about a couple of those number one\nA Cindy had a couple of different pensions that she could elect from her employer but they didn't neither of them had a cost of living adjustment\nWell for those of you listening if you've got to make a pension decision\nPlease make sure it's fully audited\nBecause in this particular case or not only was she able to get a better a rate of return on her own\nBut also able to make sure that the income lasted for both her in her spouses' lives on top of that with the ability that the pension didn't die when the second spouse died it continued on to their two daughters\nAnd not to mention the fact that when you do take the pension into your own hands right you also have the ability to on tax it\nWell that was a huge hidden wealth transformation for this client because we're able to show them how not only that but how on tax all of these to lump sum pensions to the tune of about four hundred thousand dollars that not only will they not a tax on their children and their children's children will not pay tax on that money\n[noise] after the fact that had they continue down the retirement rather on their exposure was constantly having eighty five percent of their Social Security\nBeing taxed basically by where their assets were position so shifting and timing so by shifting assets in timing the shifting of those assets in particular with the timing of this tax reform bill that's going to expire this tax sales going to be over by the end of twenty twenty five [noise]\nAnd teaching them on the date qualified for the only good through twenty twenty two we're old actually on tax them to the point to where they will not face the required minimum distribution when they turned Seventy half because we got the iris out of their IRAs completely [noise]\nTherefore none of their Social Security will be tax which also they were setting themselves up to how they hire Medicare part B in deep premium penalty [noise]\nAnd if you look at what the tax was going to steal from them and what the Medicare still hidden tax of higher premium penalties was going to cost them [noise] that was going to be about Nineteen thousand a year\nThat they were my woefully unprepared realizing that they were going to have to pay and very grateful for realizing now that they will not have to pay it folks [noise]\nHere's the opportunity I might be teaching and one of several of our crediting I'm One of our guard couple of strategies one I'm gonna teach you how to have crediting of indexing where you get credit on your money's gross when the markets are never exposure when the market's down [noise]\nBut

there are no bad reports I mean there are bad reports\nMost of the people sitting down there ... except for my pets why though [noise]\nAnd now the Democrats\nAnd I guess I'm including you to the media right I consider you a part of the Democrat Party but for you for the Democrats to be talking about we want more time to the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up\nI I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot\nSo I don't know where there'd be big discrepancy okay yes go ahead please can you know what you're really ... you've had enough\nTwenty five now to the top of the hour we're in our nation's capital the sewer those swamp Washington DC toll free our telephone number is eight hundred nine four one showing up you want to be a part of the program a obviously a lot happening here this week thirty six days until the all important mid term elections\nOr my friend and colleague from the Fox news channel is with us Tucker Carlson got a brand new book out by the way it's called ... fools that was selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution in in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where\nA party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president um but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\n... you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we are getting Tucker will go to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look cap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that\nBecause he's in the way of the Democrats retaining power I mean it's not personal\nIt's just the party won what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it are we moving to a revolution while I don't know look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not soccer is a reason that women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control that divide and conquer it's my older strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans have raised a sexist I won't give the whole list but is likely they want to throw granting over the cliff and now with Supreme Court justices\nOr if they have an opening it there seems\nTo be no ... there's nothing they won't say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor cats you know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself is pretty radical left now soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is\nAnd asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons and not enough in honor of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that taste one actually has nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be a race to watch this has to be

me and my dad who were just he just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy recalling him getting on to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there was an amazing show at its time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows them the doing of things that people want to mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation or number one person where conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect that there's something wrong then he should be thrown overboard that's number one okay that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use that power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coached ally people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public and we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita brought her ex FBI\nInvestigation they don't want any of these things because it's not the issue with politics the greatest evidence that it's politics\nAnyway

I assume it's going to happen at some point this week the way up any any timetable idea\nI don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here was the agreement with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asked\nAnd for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI to talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly\nLead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and saved his changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Jeff voted yes in committee when the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the midterms and and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for marriage as isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but it'd be a full one vote short you up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused on not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill the no already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats will know no matter who Donald Trump test ride they've already against Gore sick yeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and\nHeidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... Ford's claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\n[laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're listening [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know is about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have allied salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding\nOf what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a ... I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\n...

background check doesn't change things sixty percent of the people lay the judge Kavanaugh should be on the bench so if it if that doesn't you know all I can say is hit the stakes are high\nWho would

she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she thought either man's spike up here\nBrett Kavanaugh bono spicing or punish putting Brian Hi die I saw him gather rent fellow kept quiet girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch bowl or the punch comparison [laughter] I don't know why he can but\nI saw him by them or their financial remember parties can remember how I think everybody in the county remember that All right [noise]\nYeah we had her in front of his friends so that was ... alive today I I had a yeah\nThat's partly yeah there are people that health I have this morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says that went to the parties with her one of them said he has not recall ... sweating and another friend she named is just east we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nBy twenty five now until the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this past for a news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would things you can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic\nParty culture where almost every week cat that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the room waiting to gang rape women and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air Byron York\nIs a joining us he's been running as a lotta columns about there's not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the gold posed we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she is now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean Muslim on this on his NBC thing I think everybody's\nGot to be in two minds about it a war on on the basis of their lack of evidence and ah there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have\nBought it was given in part a due to the news networks I'm praying about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has recorded this problem or a a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are there was nothing to the story [noise]\nAnd when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and if you didn't answer the phone so I'm\nThe story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nThe New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that missile Ramirez\nLike you're on the trivia but that's what they say well\nNow we have the the democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down now Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about his drinking he said he liked me or he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drink too much beer\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said this somebody\nI blacked out correct so does he look a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here's objects question I go ahead we don't want to get out of\nThe things that he claims yeah I'm from an emphasis on me the sex misconduct allegations\nTo once he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth\nAbout drinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony\nThat he did in fact drink today Vioxx published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr are they gotta let it go there thank you so much Byron York a widow sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean has a toll free telephone number as we continue from

are calling I'm Dr Ford a credible she might be a very sympathetic to the fall you know ... I'm\n... I'm here or whatever you want to call her but she sympathetic but she's not credible and that goes to abide by the expert opinion of a prosecutor as a specialist in this field prosecutor Mitchell says it just wouldn't even make the minimum requirements to get a warrant let alone presented in court\nWas an I don't really have anything I I I think this is such a serious topic I\nI literally nothing at all bad to say about professor Ford I don't like the Dianne Feinstein hooked up with a a radical left wing attorney who's known for going after the Paula Jones well it was only ten or twelve minutes um that's Bill Clinton\nThen attorney general of Arkansas exposing his penis and saying kids that are that ten or twelve minutes she says doesn't meet the definition of sexual harassment in the workplace\nSo you got a political operative all arranged by the Democrats they perfectly the purposely hid this from the Republicans and as he has now been heard but it doesn't the stories\nNot corroborated by the very people she said would corroborate the stories including ace they allege die witness to the allegedly incident that's problematic for her at that point it becomes he said he said she said and there's no evidence\nUm and that's why the Senate should move forward at this point [noise]\nHey there's still a lot more head on the best for the Sean Hannity show stay tuned for more right after news on this station [noise]\n\nWarning if you were buried in debt you can't afford to not let the credit card companies make you think that you have to pay it all back\nBecause you don't what the credit card companies don't want you to know is that there's actually a way to get debt free without paying off your entire debt or going bankrupt if you have five thousand dollars or more in credit card debt you know have the right to let us settle that debt for a fraction of what you will for free information called debt free dot com now\nAt one eight hundred two hundred seven four zero to relieve in show you how much money you could save if you are struggling to pay off your debt do not let the credit card companies make you think that you have to call debt free dot com now for free information on how to get out of debt faster than you ever thought possible without banquet\nUh we know Claire McCaskill is a no we ah have a battle going out Martha ... I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but\nThese numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nAll that it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap does as closed almost two dead even hauled and you see Republicans and important Senate races now a dead heat in all of the states that are red states where where Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice calving off and we see that first time when he is sitting\nIn the Supreme Court I think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they ... they did everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans\nAnd there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people\nAre Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we have been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with\nCertainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they can bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case that professor before there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything forensic league that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe that they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear\nCory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer has just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I founded painful um\nHe he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process of the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhy do you just put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know\nI've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty\nAnd one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this way the candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator or in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections\nThat you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and and people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be in a business\nAnd our school just may apply missiles ... kills it is taken lives destroyed families and ruined childhoods we need to take action immediately the missile field a patient registry active
