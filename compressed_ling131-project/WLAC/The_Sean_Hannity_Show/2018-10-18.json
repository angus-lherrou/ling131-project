nobody in the world\nThat's why first seven years I have harassed and bother poor Josh ... atlas MD Wichita, Kansas not only do I put them on radio and TV oh no that's not enough I set up meetings with him he flies to Washington on his own that we should pay him\nYou know although I'll probably get accused of something if I offer to pay for something\nI'm been oh we should fund the effort fifty dollars a month on limited concierge care he negotiates directly with pharmaceuticals Ninety five percent reduction\nYou you need chemotherapy got breast cancer or for a lot of those drugs it six dollars or treatment\nGood luck getting those prices anywhere we couldn't institutionalized this\nAnyway so there's ... there's not running on what they believe we've learned that with Brett us in in Tennessee thanks to project beret toss we've learned with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover videos she's white they outrageous we needed investigation investigation into what\nThe fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to pay to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them then go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they define who they really are they can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five ... forty five impeached forty five reclaiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it when I'm ... now I don't want\nAbout it just don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want oh why did they want to open borders do they calculated that's gonna benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics\nAgain if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well the only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline psychotic hatred of this president they want to go back to what back to Obamacare\nThey weren't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power for ever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for this is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs keep Obamacare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why because they're dependent on them the crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barbershops their Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves while they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them very different\n[noise] so that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it you've got to understand this is a about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times science Hannity you've told us that before\nYeah I bet on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated his where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs is one that you know one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try a bike and then a Percocet and knocks econ and then they go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of there's this is why you try heroin does much better high and the only ten dollars a bag and they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it\nAnd then eventually they're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called ... and all\nYou know talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son ... bought an than that which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt it will kill you\nAnd we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see with Kavanaugh\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nThat no corroborating evidence I still believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl\nAnd after they spike the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend and then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again after eight FBI investigations what\nAre they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got for a million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back since he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents\nCombined\nUh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre then we've got oh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting his rockets nobody thought that you know being tough on the Iranians would would bear fruit but the Iranians are dying economically because the president leading a boycott\nAnd then on top of that what record low unemployment fourteen states

know that you were jak those values that are the and hit the system the values that we hold dear in near and cherish in this country\nNobody ever asks the Democrats about that or the same thing with with Benghazi I mean we we leave these guys in Benghazi and they're making deals with you know that the awfully\nGood grief\nSuch hypocrisy I mean they claim to be have a monopoly a compassionate all this but they want it wasn't it's complicated because you have a ... a an unprecedented alliance that's emerged in as a result of Iranian had Gemini and rainy and ... you know ambition to acquire nuclear weapons\nAnd the Iranians that chant death to Israel death to America burn the American flag burning the Israeli flag well you have an alliance because of that real clear present danger to the world if you ever marry their version of radical Islam they're the number one\nTerrorist sponsoring the terrorist sponsoring state in the world\nThey fight so many different proxy wars fomenting ... around the world they're pursuing nuclear weapons and that has caused the U.S the Israelis the Saudis the Emirates the Egyptians the Jordanians to create an alliance\nIt's not so easy to just say as awful\nAs horrific an evil why believe they probably did it's not that simple there is more nuanced context texture it's sort of like the U.S aligning with the former Soviet Union to defeat the Nazis we hated the were at odds with the\nPatent wanted to go right straight to Moscow if you remember\nBut it was an alliance the beat back the forces of fascism you know at that time and the forces of Nazi is them at that time\nWe have we not a window of opportunity I Can't believe\nWell I Can't believe because I've been telling you about Syria radical Islamic State's theocracy is and how they

the New America because I didn't I don't remember that\nWell that certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing or the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new street violence a which in the end I think\nTurns people off because it's it's it's it's also a little scary because ... ... when he was shot um you know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance\nIs conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not they're not materialized because that's never been as the tension his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think I think he is the four o cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all the judicial appointments oh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now\nIf you go back to Goldwater before your movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulated each a pro American\nPro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives\nCitizen lived for a long time in Saudi Arabia and it looks like he walked into the Saudi count council a in a counselor in in Istanbul and\nIt looks like he was murdered now Mike Pompeo was asking the president to give the Saudis a couple of days they say they're going to get to the bottom of it\nBut I don't really have any doubt that this guy was murdered and murdered by the Saudis and I doubt it happened without the crown prince and other top people in Saudi Arabia knowing if that's the case\nYou know I Know Democrats want to pressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people that Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis she never brought up their horrific treatment of women\nKilling gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in\nSaudi Arabia um and the same would go for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what do you what do you think that's why\nI think I mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious\nOr do indicate Clinton that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on in that I I think there will be very foolish for us to\nA break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key to containing Iran a but but I think we have to get to the bottom of the plumbing also point out to folks I'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion in which the Russians are decide they want to\nPush the U.S Senate or\nIf I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed and the circumstances are just strange they're gonna they're gonna kill him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nKnowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um it's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them do it on their sloppy and stupid and you know ... ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies\nAnd you're right we have this on President alliance against the Iranian had Gemini with the Saudis Israelis Emirates Jordanians and Egyptians and you know now that creates massive complications\nWell in but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain and it's led to a very specific sanctions\nOr I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis have the least promised secretary of state compare that they're going to give him the full report now but yeah or they may well be lying but\nIf in the end\nWe discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia involved I suspect it will be sanctions but the difference is one thing they have sanctions there's another thing you know to go wild and break up the if the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear that they regard Saudi Arabia\nAs such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful and this process\nWe've got to go but um that's the speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat

put together the puzzle that is now filling in as the house of cards begins to collapse\nNo exactly he's got to come in and answer questions who else may have been in that room I Will tell you this Maria when Jim Baker was in his deposition two weeks ago\nAnd was asked about this he was as serious as you can be and describing what he understood some place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein where Mr Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United states so he needs to come in and answer questions and like I said if it takes a subpoena that's exactly what should be a shoo\nEmail you were in a deposition with with James Baker the first one and you're going to end with hand this upcoming Thursday what do you want to get from James Baker this week\nWell first of all remember who said this is this for the FBI chief counsel all kinds of things flow through him so when he said that he believe Rod Rosenstein was serious about this this al ... the lens out a statement about recording the president\nYou got to take that with the way that it comes with because if the if the FBI chief counsel so we're going to ask you more about that we have our our previous deposition was cut off early\nWe go we we ran out of time so we need him back in there we're we're going to ask more about that specific meeting that took place and then his conversations with people who were in that\nMeeting those went and while he talked to so all those things need to be a quick break right back from Palm Beach in the Sean Hannity show [noise]\n\nFor

Carter Page you can't make any of this up for people now saying Rod Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the four people that was very clear about Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we're still awaiting the de classification\nOf let's see three oh twos gang of eight information Pfizer warrants\nA we're also awaiting you know whether or not we're going to get an redacted Pfizer applications pages pen through twelve seventeenth ... thirty four remember the bulk of information for the price of warrants\nWas the pony never verified never corroborated Russian dot CA that Hillary paid for there's so much it stinks to high heaven or John Solomon I was an article yesterday in his article\nWhat he's talking about all these FBI top the oj officials there on all the special interest junk kits\nAnd guess who is probably the most frequent user of the Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann though one after Paul Manafort\nThat Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs as it relates to Anderson accounting when you go back years and the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court the same guy the sent for Merrill executives to jail for a year\nAnd that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals but sounds complicated it really is it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country\nAnd I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown in Carter Page was banned at the center of\nAll of this for the last year and a quarter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew you well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back\nFrom places like Russia or you would willingly ... feet deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help the country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ...\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the ... of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now you are as bad as they say\nChina it's just it it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just that just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigations\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that as you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government and hopefully uh hopefully the uh the cards are starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and I I think we're getting into that as you've been a a all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo I bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roads called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey been obstructed every step of the way request document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turning out to be having nothing to do with national\nSecurity only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just\nThe last two weeks oh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here doesn't have time to testify under oath Glenn Simpson has pleading\nThe fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe in one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire to go after the president of the United states\nOr if you were representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and is now by the way of course conducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong\nThings have gone with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the probably the most important point going on here Congress's\nRole in providing oversight um\nYou know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work\nCommission and good let's work as a vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements that these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we've talked about this\nNinety nine page report on Pfizer court a abuses that uh they director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts an agenda by law enforcement officers to invade the law the there is by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet\nAnd that's a finds a quarter of review there is a court that just above the five to ... it will also under their rule for consider procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice appointed right now that I just ran us and telling telling them for different circuits\nMaybe ... maybe that court should be the subject of the uh the ... the forum for a motion to review what's going on in the ... the court also just remembering you have in the fire support efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges\nA fraud was committed on every one of them they were ... that run verified uncorroborated information to spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach collie or the judge and the court and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and\nIt violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out anytime the most sensitive area of our government probably because it's an ex part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nNo you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnivals salt would do to get your reaction considering you as of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as of now\nHave you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled and not just basically a I don't know taken the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about they use phony information to obtain the warning against you but of all the agencies in the federal\nGovernment Solomon points out that should be immune to special interest schmoozing the the OJ as\nPremier law enforcement agencies like the FBI the DEA the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives topped the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential to their success and the trust the American\nPublic puts in them but\nThis week the D. O. j.'s internal watchdog put a rare spotlight on the gratuities inside the department and then he goes on to explain\nTo people and the FBI and the OJ accepting free sporting event tickets from a TV reporter\nThey don't even give the names of recipients hundreds of pages of government ethics filings reveal that in the past three years the deal Jay\nOn the Democrat Republican presidents has allowed hundreds of their employees to accept free travel lodging food from special interests across a blow globe and I'm looking at this and I'm saying you know\nReally you've got to be kidding me because if anybody else did this\nThat would be called influence peddling and on top of the list we got a guy by the name of Andrew Weissmann new except that apparently more than a dozen free trips your reaction Carter\nSean you know this goes back to sort of the crux of the matter in terms of my case and all the abuses that happened around day it's not about me and it's not about\nAny ah any you know specifics in terms of myself it's really about our country and I\nThink what you see in terms of some of these ah actions that they were doing I'm against the rules and potentially against the law that really reflects you know people just looking out for themselves and yeah it's like President Trump always said as a candidate or it's not about me it's about us and you know\nWhen they when they come after me they're they're just doing it to ah to get get him at the end of the day so that was it's really a a a huge problem\nPick it up with the Carter page David show will get his reaction of that on the other side eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program by the way my buddy Steve ... is going to weigh in at the bottom of this half hour want to remind you look my pillow has changed my life\nI fall asleep faster I stay asleep longer it just works is neither drug or alcohol induced now my pillows even gotten better because they created the my pillow mattress top are now all the benefits the comfort of your neck your spine your back\nIt's called ... and here's how it works\nWith Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get to lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nYou're more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origin nation and for the fifth\nYear in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing reached shield another way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin rock and were dating comparison obligated records ritual approval only balance or eight thirty or just turned ... information and conditions equal housing lender licensing office he did an elective or thirty thirty additional conditions are excluded may apply\nIf you suffer from E.
