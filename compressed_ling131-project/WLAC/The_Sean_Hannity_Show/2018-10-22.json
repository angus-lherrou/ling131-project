{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "... days really talk radio tonight when I read every Fifteen ten W. L. A. the\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nReally shutting down a woman or online services something called Google Plus [noise]\nAfter they found a software glitch that exposed private profile data of nearly half a million users to outside software developers this all happened last week\nGoogle they should\nGo ... plus never amounted to much of anything but they did have some people who signed up with a half million people private information was lost so rather than things that they shut down the platform\nOr not it wasn't on purpose of course but the glitch in their software was there for nearly three years\nUh nobody's reported being an identity theft victim yet and it may be a matter of time before us determine whether it be exposed data will be used against somebody for Google it was enough to shut down Google Plus\nAnd is just another example of how much personal data is available online and how hard it is to make sure your data is protected\nAnd we we keep circling back to this but folks it really is the case lifelike is the answer to this\nIdentity theft as a crime that most people are unaware when it's happened to it can be months before your stolen data is used [noise]\nBut when it is is when having life lock counts because they spotted\nWay ... you become a life like memory you automatically created on line profiled based of how you deal on line including your online shopping an activity that profile as a computer algorithm it's not identified to you by name Google or rather lifelike people can't go figure out what you're doing [noise]\nIf it's all with computer numbers that it's all encrypted it's just when an aberration happens in your profile that's when the red flags ... go off\nAnd that's when lifelike let you know that there's\nAbnormal activity on your account they ask you if it's you or not if it's not you didn't they get in gear trying to shut it down they have a restoration team that does nothing but work with you to fix it all and put everything back to normal and they don't stop until that happens\nNow hopefully it's never necessary but if it is there's nobody in life locks league at dealing with this kind of identity threat the new life like plan includes ... security they give you that it's a it's a software\nPackage that protects your heart where your laptop computer or your uh your desktop or whatever against malware and ransomware\nNow always remembered that no one or no one company can prevent all identity theft nobody can manage ... monitor and manage every transaction out there but life flock is in a leading alone all by itself\nIn offering the best identity theft protection there is sign up by going online that life lock dot communist my name get ten percent off\nAnd twenty five dollar Amazon gift card or you can do it by phone\nEight hundred for forty forty eight thirty three either way life locked dot com or eight hundred for forty forty eight thirty three and make sure\nYou use my name when you sign up you know I've had them soundbites here I have a chance to get to it but CNN really did an [noise]\nA trick they they play the sound by to me that was an excerpt and trying to make it look like I was up the opinion that whatever happened to them all to show me it was okay because it was a buddy of bin Laden's\nOr John King that I I Can't I Can't believe that they left out me saying\nNone of this ... is intended to say he deserves to die don't mistake that the bite\nThey played everything I said up until that I was going to share it with you today but it just didn't reach the top of their priorities stack maybe I'll hold onto it till tomorrow and get it in with whatever\nSomebody has to have to say\nRussia's probably by being met\nFor Russia and your smartphone with the IRA radio ads\nI'm ... Cox owner of blind stir dot com\nYou know I made it my life's mission to convince everyday people that measuring in installing custom blinds is one of the easiest do it yourself projects there is not blind stir are consummate blondes are not only easy to install our prices are often less than those off the shelf blinds you'll find it big box retail stores\nAnd now made it even easier check out our new no tool cellular shades\nThe first and only shades installed without any screws or tools\nYou heard me right customs shades they're installing without any tools what can be easier\nWith my personal fitter free guarantee I guarantee your bonds will fit their own remake the free of charge you only pay shipping\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict it as simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida you'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his race is by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got ... whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida and you know run just said this about a great debate last night and he's now fighting to\nTo prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax Gillum would support\nGillum is we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett us it and the project versus tape and the great state of Tennessee\nAnyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Britain is out there trying to convince the people tend to see that it's something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not gonna not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we gotta lotta new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to\nWe know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes even his Democratic colleagues don't think it's gonna happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate\nHave faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with the party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber\nIt's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're going to we're going to take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy\nAnd then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha mix Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have ... Democrats are urging caution and the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs of the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom ... still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Rhonda Santa's becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold the seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in\nThe state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence\nWe have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost Democratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and and we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we've got the cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country\n\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you call ... life\nFor example Georgia's forty\nHe was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes Mets to

ever afford out that the caravan has now grown according to the Washington Times fourteen thousand illegal immigrants marching towards our southern border the president just spoke\nOut about it I'm going to play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour out if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now service escorts that appears for the care of on as they know battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspapers say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance but they appear confident that this confrontation is going to come\nDown to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh mattered they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence\nThey also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the and Americans in stink to believe don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country\nWe don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nAnd the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic laws\nAnd that would mean building the wall that he\nWanted to build that we can get done by the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back with a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead\n[noise] a\nRadio Ninety eight to ten W. L. A. C. [noise]\n\n\nSean Hannity is broadcasting now on over five unwritten radio stations around the world now Sean\nBy twenty five to the top of the hour new estimates cited by L. universal\nMexican newspapers as the caravan has now grown to fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others wage that's part of the story the president now has alerted the military to be on standby for possible deployment orders to the U.S southern border\nI mean this is in every word you know I remember I think Michelle Malcolm wrote a book years ago called invasion the American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is their moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the\nDaily Caller has a piece out saying that the majority of people in the care of on not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports that this new way above\nA caravan or is is comprised quote a mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know by a chain link fence said that Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling offense others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nAnd this is now a confrontation that is coming\nThe southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping\nThe caravan ... make their way to our southern border president has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there around you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan and the report friday said that they met people from ... dash\nThat are joining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating Walla ... while the mullah in Mexico the bridges ... packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country and yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from\nThe Rio Grande the San Diego helicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there I saw it in the entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me\nUh I've been to the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that of that had been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is going to win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free healthcare the Gavin Newsom as promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nThat they want a month\nLong Johns is no reason for them by\nLooking at it we have a lot of different ah\nConcept right now they have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now

going to be I think\nThey really wanted to see that I'm On his side and I am a hundred percent ... ah we have I mean you've been reporting over a hundred thousand people they lined up two days ago and it's very exciting when there's one thing that will be a big factor that I got to get up really\nGoing to make a great deal of age I'm going to get up I'm going to make a great speech I Hope you are you folks do you go and you're not going I Can't believe it you're not going to be there 'cause I remember him or her\nI think Beto O'Rourke is highly overrated ... what I heard about him I figured you must be something a little ... not really I thought he got beaten badly in the debate I think he's a highly overrated guy\n\nAt it\nAnd I got along very well very late in pain and I said don't worry about it is only white guy\nA long shot I like to remember the last one that really had I mean I was very late is actually held a rally to get the latest I edited and then it got back\nOut of you look at what's happening in Germany it was pretty much like\nAll right that's the president I'm speaking with reporters these are about to board marine one headed to a joint sub base Andrews ... head on out to Texas in Houston but the big rally tonight what even Bernie Sanders says Democrats should stop writing off\nHalf of America so now we've got lawlessness accepted no presumption of innocence Kevin uno due process capital\nLawless this on our borders lawlessness which sanctuary cities and sanctuary states you know I sat through that briefing with Rick Perry weapon to see this weekend I liked very much our energy secretary\nAnd six hundred and forty two thousand crimes committed against Texans and just the seven year period alone\nAnd it's also about angry mobs that we saw all weekend long I mean the most vicious bio horrible nobody in the Democratic party speaking out none of them are joining the president and saying oh we support your defending the borders

election day\nOr a newly redistricted congressional district ten in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sex the pre term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nHarry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read the draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nThat's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week the book they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it to to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me is the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlight it some of the things er during the course of the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh the the same playbook which is ... ... actually it's kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right and now they're blaming us for messing it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but you know

finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell let's all hardly they tried to fix it well millions of Americans\nNow they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is well Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone I mean it will all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where you're going to have the young

permission or illegal aliens illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S legally president's decision to end DACA was heartless and\nWas brain was when we used phrases like undocumented workers we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration hundreds hundreds of thousands of families\nWill be ripped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and wrong and the ... of American businesses will lose hardworking employees\nAnd the arguments them is the president is Americans don't want to do the work wage I Can't\nAmerican workers to do the work was the president that is a crop in many instances that's just not true\nIn my view from decision to end the DACA program or some eight hundred thousand young people in the ... and most ugly presidential are in the modern just three of this country I cannot\nThink of one thing though which is ugly and more cruel\nWe've got to do several things than I Am you know adamantly against illegal immigration people have to stop employee illegal immigrants\nCome to west Chester showed is that they can Nassau County stand in the street corners on in the front of the world's if people waiting to get picked up\nAnd go do yard work in construction work and domestic for you know this is not a problem that the people who are coming into the country are solely responsible for counting if we end for them to work\nKeep families\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship what a bunch of phony\nAll of them almost partly as a matter of fact it is all the uh Joe is an L. O. J. what's up Joe how are you glad you called sir\nJohn near the number one supporter of Donald Trump in the country I think he's the best present world history he needs to send troops down to stop this invasion and I think you would agree with that we just can't afford to take all these people and we we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt and so I Hope he will send troops down to stop this invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and you know now they're trying to precipitated crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this\nAnd yet you keep breeding reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well fed food and water you know the goal is to get them up to our southern border but\nYou know once after the seven thousand is gonna be ten thousand more is it going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan\nYou know everybody come here because Mitt term ...\nWell I think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of\nDue process and the presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and there's Tylenol Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mobs that were out all all over the place this weekend\nAnd the success and failure Obama's failure Trump success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote we'll see what happens in Fifteen days though Joe thank you eight hundred nine four one showing our number Brian is in Lexington, Kentucky Brian how are you and we're glad you called sir\nYes sir I was calling about the migration in Russia on our border and I want to know your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes\nOrganizing this basically committing treason and is that something Trump could find out through the FBI and maybe you need to look into that and find out exactly who's you know hashed out this big plan now that we know what's going on\nWhat what is it we know what's going on we know that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying all of these countries that were given a lot of aid to\nAnd they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what do you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us in or were horrible people uh especially when the the only place they can seek asylum is the first country they get to that would be Mexico in Mexico obviously didn't have the will lower desire to do anything\nAnywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nIs leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else and throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurts severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using it but he Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identify the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light Sean like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light well the president has the Trump\nTwitter insect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she is less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's\nThing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end\nOf the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted and so once again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the order tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get\nA you know I'm I'm I'm I'm promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows ... they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but\nAlso the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's getting lower middle class families shot now to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I thought as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nShowing it showing listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies on because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes it never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat\nTelling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to I used to\nThink Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper\nAll of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs and eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps so dramatic turn around and they're back happily working\nAnd some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also responsible gun owners that's why we're friends with the U. S. C. C. A. they're giving away free gun every day twenty four days now you'll get all the official rules when you go to defend family dot com\nThe commemorative one ounce coin is the only presidential Trump coin made Ninety nine point nine percent silver not silver plated [noise] and it's IRA approved the price of silver rises so will the value of these point\nGo to the Trump coin twenty twenty dot com

coins available for a limited time only go to the Trump point twenty twenty dot com today standard tax rates may apply\nQuite ruled brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration law\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nFully funds President Trump's border\nCaseload appeal lies and criminal\nAmerican citizens have the right to vote\nThe leadership of President Trump's new\nSo President Trump\nFor the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy\nIs built the wall and enforce the law act\nFor my safety for the express [noise]\nWas thinking when you ... the ... as I\nCall him a he's a great friend of mine these amazing he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background real roots his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in a book about how well the mean horrible landlords\nActually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the camera want a family in thirty forty your friends and stuff and I wanted to relate that story in an auto it quickly\nFred Trump showing up to collect ranch with his twenty six year old son Donald Trump in and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent\nThe father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker ... and it's sort of looking at them saying okay no problem there very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days later\nA he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story about their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media above people talk about what does the president that compassion for these people does the president that after the\nThe answer is yes she learned at the riding shotgun with his father was he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are collecting rent from collar people that were living shot so so I Want to get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success in many ways the additive family [noise] is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America that both parties that broke up America\nYou know the the generation is built this country that none of them is Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built these this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country by grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we'll look forward to my friend and uh all the best when your book tour and I hope people will run out and get a copy of it because it's worthwhile reading I appreciate\nIt ...\nThanks my friend with Fifteen days till election day one of the important Senate races were watching is out in the great state of Arizona which by the way could be impacted by this caravan that his marching towards our southern border as we speak\nSenate candidate and war hero Martha McSally is going up against Christians cinema Christian cinemas seems to be imploding out there of will get the state of the race has the best election coverage continues Fifteen days till election day glad you are with us it's the Sean Hannity show\n[noise]\nWhen news breaks you hear the Inside Story that no one else has and behind the scenes chatter that the mainstream media doesn't even know about\nIs is a Sean Hannity show here in his leg groups that accuse us border patrol according to American troops terrorism\nHad been here since I was with a liberal friends she asked you to\nHear it [laughter]\nI ran for the state house from\nHere since I was in the spring\nMy back Sally and I approve this message\nI we have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now glad you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour a that was an ad put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experiences pretty unbelievable here also watching an Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border it's become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back I'm\nKristin set them up once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake yeah that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America\nUm she had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha mix Sally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacks\nBe a stay at home moms for ... off their husbands these women who lack like staying at home ... their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing checks of some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think Martha McSally is with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls want to do it by seven want to do it by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ and send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed in her mocking Arizona an air extremism on so many issues as being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to me serving twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know a huge served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had\nSix deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse and send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include you know truthful I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but often times uh you know the ... the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "22"}
