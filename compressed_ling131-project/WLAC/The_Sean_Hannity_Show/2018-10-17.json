it's even worse than what we thought yesterday\nYou know think about is negotiations with little rocket man and my fire and fury my button is bigger than yours or negotiating that NATO now pay their fair share when we pay Seventy two cents of every dollar for defense mostly of our Western European allies or\n... you know demanding better more fair trade deals with our Western European partners with Canada with Mexico people don't understand is if you don't threatened to pull out of a deal\nAnd you don't threatened tariffs you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past ... asked for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across this country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous secure I don't care about it I Want I Want this country mouse burst\nHe also did something that the mainstream media is reporting on the twenty fifth of July the declaration of a cease fire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nPressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting is pretty ... joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and he's treated ... grievances with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show ... owned by me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that would tell me by now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nDon't question yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're just to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled\nUh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it done shortly thereafter [noise]\nAh because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very core\nOf but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government\nAre and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why he's doing so well ... and by the way you know I was ... doing a lot of traveling around the country I was in Detroit last night I spoke to three or four hundred people I'm Down here in Miami each day and the whisper rate is up you know that whisper rate we saw it on people that they don't like Trump but then they\nPull you aside as you say Sean by the way\nI happen to really like otherwise isn't that what this group\nThere is an intensity of his supporters and

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just order this guy and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most fading right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator\nHad been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate mission for good reason\nWell I'd listen I when you expose fraud what this is now we're supposed to something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeached forty five impeach forty five then\nWe see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do\nDon't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and the high who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially\nHas to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding hiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money through ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderates is a front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it has a truism that in order to get elected in the state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people\nHad it when the Democratic party abandon any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart\nThey still didn't care and I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchists middle class of vendors attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nOf her name is state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist after trying to stop him from kicking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she said that and I'm going to quote it she says well it started with Josh Hawley arrested her opponent would be part of ... betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she is one on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will buy what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own their own their own learn something\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next to roast about how she's going to impeach Trump but you can tell the moderates to get over it\nAfter she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting to expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nJust glad that you were able to get all of this out than before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates well I have known you now what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release the candidate of the time we have to the United states senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the Olympic ... tactics against the landscapes the Lenski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will\nBe releasing another video early next week and it's very very a battleground state [noise] same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected to the new deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotape stopped my words stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nNot let people watch it to themselves and they can decide people are pretty smart um oh James O'Keefe is with us founder and the c._e._o. project Vera ... dot com and\nThe videos are up there and you can check 'em out yourself a boat Claire McCaskill and her staff and bill Brett us than and his staff and now he's telling us there's more to come we'll come back we'll take a quick break we'll come back and continue eight hundred nine four one showing a toll free telephone number will make a quick stop\nOr there is an opponent for Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren Jeffs deal and or does that that that raised now need re evaluation by the people of Massachusetts will get to that\nAnd your calls a eight hundred million for one shown as a number will continue\n[noise]\nBorn in and investigate in those stories that mattered EU\nIs our number ... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren was he does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American\nWe can go back to Nineteen eighty six the Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled how while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week\nWell it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according\nTo the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this then tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to let somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people in Massachusetts can wake up how you doing\nTo shine great to be a way they think hey this is the state where I'm stuck around one when he ran again or of\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush um\nWhen Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "17"}
