these mobs don't stop what they're doing\nNow and the mobs in the cases I was talking about you know let through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama in the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some advice about putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday like they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke\nApparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity and he ... a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nCrap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I you could see\nThis building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is done to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the hose you can't let these activists you know getting in the face is fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious but what's gonna happen to somebody and and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video and Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this\nHe's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing he's not working is on his off time\nSome guy comes literally right up to the table to\nBang on the table and then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets hit with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if\nDonald Trump calls the news media fake news\nAnd they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global Islam among American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national\nList and his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans\nAnd women in the workplace they weren't does this proportionally impacted by the horrific policies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear\nYou know leading up to this I had been saying this is not\nGoing to end well somebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states\nYou want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home and chapter ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters ... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder tech them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore and watch it had happened to all these Republicans does any of this\nYou know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life\nUh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago\nMaybe people born is alarms that was it was from the minute the news broke this morning in the media is gone wall to wall with reports of suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama recall there was another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters\nActually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact that story got so little coverage\nThat I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt her heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had covering walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nAbout left or right when when we found out that the that's the least this shooter happen to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I he can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not

L. A.\nNever stops working for the good of a country Sean Hannity were behind the scenes information on today's breaking news apathy is on right now\nMy twenty five 'til the top of the hour Thirteen Days till the all important midterm elections and of course our top story today and we have other issues we're going to get too including Newt tape that has been a shot undercover\nThat really exposes Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota literally the ... she ... she'll be a super liberal every elected [noise] that's what they're caught saying on tape\nYou know she's she'd be bolder if she's reelected and everything I'm just like reticent in Tennessee just like\nClaire McCaskill in Missouri now we got Heidi Heitkamp acting one way before an election and trying to bamboozled the people in the states I'm you know it's a\nAnd one of the things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have\nThe what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this is going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off\nAn opioid bill signing event of the White House and uh he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice presidents or comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as media outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians\nThey getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that is this happen to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump and Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIs Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is probably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nAnd they've been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through um what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all and we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from shore throughout the day\nOut of the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority so the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that\nActs or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement\nCondemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming\nBut that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously\nAlmost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a decade\nMoney and just say Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the job we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical\nIs especially important\nOh in New York 'cause there's no place in the state of the New York if you're pro life pro Second Amendment I happen to be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it going to tell you a little story so I had this and and when\nTo live through this and when the you know we're still very great friends with the lease who work for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things will really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yep we just saw her\nUm it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office of Fox right uh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over and the sad thing is and she was an isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even it was just horrible for her editors\nCordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us and we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda\nOn a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about I mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one\nParticular person at another network I won't say who\nWas going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI as a person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants\nAnd attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spent on you or threaten you were following you\nI have had all the above and it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our ... our politicians have whoever did this\nIs not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we don't always thing yet who's responsible by immediate the trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat ever say well the president says fake news\nAre they are fake news you know the truth is ... words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that that was incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable they apocryphal see how many of you know how many reported the three weeks ago rights and letters were sent to the president and secretary of defense Mattis indoor FBI Director ray and to our CIA director\nGina Haspel anybody even hear about that\nI didn't hear a lot of concern from people on the left when Don junior when he had gone through that and by the way that's nothing compared to the threats people getting these\nThis is happening every day this is a very very dangerous political environment everybody needs to take a deep breath you don't like you you you want Nancy Pelosi speaker go vote for you want Chuck Schumer to be set of majority you have the ability to go vote\nOn so and so it was governor go vote\nKeep your hands to yourself and uh you know and keep it in and leave people if they're in public alone or at least leave the women ... percent Pam Bondi alone and secretary Nielsen and Sarah Sanders and our kids alone if Ted Cruz's out with his wife can you leave them alone leave his wife alone\n\nYou want to if I'm sitting alone or the group but my guy friends

face\nHillary Clinton you can't be civil Eric Holder can't come Maxine Waters repeatedly you know create a crowd confront them in restaurants department stores gas stations and I wanted anywhere anymore and now\nToday the media is quite as well it's talk Radio's fault it's Fox News's Paul this is Trump's fault\nNo it would be you know the rhetoric on the left and all these incidents I don't hear a single person speak out ever we you know here's a fact nobody right now knows anything about who's responsible\nFor and whether or not these are actual bombs that's not even been confirmed yet but they're meant to look like bombs maybe the white powder was meant to look like rice and or\nOr some type of other you know poison we don't know yet we knew we knew know three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to President Trump\nSecretary of defense Mattis FBI Director re CIA director Gina Haspel that we know anyway former NYPD Commissioner a Bernie carrying is with us a book by the way phenomenal\nThe grave above the grave commissioner of the police department of New York I call him ...\nA dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent his best selling book is out now it's called Spygate welcome both of you to the program today the president condemning whoever is responsible for sending these items and even then he's getting criticized you know you would think listening to the media that it was him who sent them\nAnd meanwhile they been silent with all these public confrontations Bernie look\nI've lived in New York a long time um it's been a while I don't get mail anymore but I've had the white powder scare I had a an assistant a mind quarantine for about nine hours while they were testing out whether anthrax spores were in the package it turned out thankfully that was not the case we saw that a lot after nine eleven\nYou know was shown it just kind of reminds me of that because the after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary a after nine eleven we actually got anthrax or at city hall\nWe got it at a B. C. N. D. C. I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw cause producers\nI'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know these packages these devices are real um you don't know who sent ... what the purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms in the next two days perhaps\nUm but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices and and they knocked him without detonating that uh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie ... when you detonate the stuff but you know you blow to pieces it's harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send to a ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps were writing the device slim side they're going to break the stuff down\nWhere and how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYou know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different areas and there's so many packages lose a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the ... gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be\nRight off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some radical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nNo and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices a note on one with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nIncentive vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs\nAnd there'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop a new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult waves is\nBasically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that police Sean that this person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices\nSent to CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does it work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out the John Brennan and then you know and it'd be the comet he's not a CNN country of this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you weren't enough of the Savage at an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail

the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come\nIn rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right and then you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City\nWhen you've got hundreds just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms over the next two weeks so we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days or they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody there to look at because there's just way too much here\nUm that's been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe we often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and\nI've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could have been Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see paste I again I haven't obviously haven't analyze these devices but having seen what the press is put out and went to the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices as if almost somewhat either\nDidn't know what they were doing a march sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God or\nThey somehow want it to get caught like we saw on that bombing in ... in Austin but you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they that they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre ah\nWhole cases very bizarre even look John even look at something like the packaging I notice the oversized hyping the pictures the media is put out about these days\nYou know always a pleasure eight hundred nine four one showing us a toll free telephone number\nOr when we come back we're going to

fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and\nWe and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your toaster down and the staffer says\nWell because the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff say\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected that staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again\nSo she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that well that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to them out or if they have to woo the moderates and they and they can only make one choice once\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is is a a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I'd yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo
