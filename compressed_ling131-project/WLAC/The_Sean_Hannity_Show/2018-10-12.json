Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handles Hurricane Katrina now the left\nHates him because he is embracing the president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it hurt don't told Trump to bring these guys in the I shouldn't unknown I should've known Geraldo told\nTrump to get Kanye West and Aaron John Brown and tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know what that Geraldo did bring up a or something I forgot it was\nKanye West who told George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted blacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave\nAnd go to Texas or someplace to lessen the strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also a was able to steer the hurricane and that Bush\nWas responsible for the Lebanese being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money to shore them up\nBut it was Kanye West so can you hear all kinds of crab back then in two thousand five rip it in the Bush they loved him but the love was sleeping obviously be right back to\nRussia Mickey I we were listening while you were at W. dot com\nWhen my cardiologist told me I needed to take a stab rump to lower my cholesterol he also told me that it can lower my natural levels of co Q. ten\nHe told me to take to ... it has the number one cardiologist recommended form of co Q. ten are very important nutrient for healthy heart healthy blood pressure level tuna with three times better absorption\nAs the number one cardiologist recommended form of cookie to take to know the better co Q. ten [noise]\nTonight ten nine central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady\nOf women in the me too movement\nCall you a supporter no question off limits you're not the first first lady to\nHave to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity has put a strain on your marriage to not one of them a lot of the Trump say let's talk about the jacket this\nWhy did you wear being along\nThe ABC exclusive that don't miss it tonight at ten nine central on ABC\nFew minutes away on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten WINZ [noise]\nBy the way getting out of here and want to want to welcome back [noise] everybody in Panama City that is able to listen to the radio they being at work [noise] utilized a helicopter\nAnd satellite dish they got the broadcast tower and facilities of our Panama City affiliate back up and running all ready that's W. F. L. F. F. A. M. A. R. Ninety four point five and it's great to have them all ready back\nIn the service [noise] um [noise]\nIt's devastating what happened to everybody up there and it's [noise] it's just it's it's great that we were able to get that station back up and running a supervisor whatever assistance that's possible from here so\nWelcome back W. F. L. F. F. M. Ninety four point five and Panama City and everybody there and we'll be back on Monday you have a great weekend Fox\nWe are with you on the ... that message from President Trump to every state hit by hurricane Michael the storm now blamed for at least Thirteen deaths in four states from Florida to Virginia and damage assessments continue Fox's Evan brand live in Miami\nI think that that should be basic and fundamental for\nAnybody the issue of incivility is now back in the forefront even more I mean it shouldn't surprise anybody um and by the way what is really happening what a play ... James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away and the polls a little bit there him and his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or cinema oh why do we get to the tape on sentiment today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but because when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nFrankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea what Republicans also offering solutions and answers and solving problems\nAnd the numbers beret out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama which put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post chops and never come back well in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here in building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and tell them well you know it's costing us\nYou know thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books and then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America\nAnd then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America and then on top of that any challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years\nAnd he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out and we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico\nHave you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about ... being in the White House listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like\nWhy do we think we need some prison reform or give me an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of ballast marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug a fence\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties as like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system anyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail and an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nInto the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down well I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance\nAnd you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people you also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk\nBecause the murder rate in New York well I've been hearing the Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago I mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary our our human our human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable\nWe can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know the ... they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat folks aren't that since he's praying Kanye West and the race on draft now the sudden ... because he put on a lot of hot and he's an attention more like the president have all of a sudden now that the the models folks person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump administration's miss\nWas an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think when you had there man has clearly not okay to president who's willing for boy that was a combination of famous consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health and the question has other calling him I felt very point Anthony and that was something very fragile valid and sad about tiny pulling out of the phone and France like Titanic as colorfully outside I think for their own somewhere picture of a ... I mean [laughter]\nThan on that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television at\nThat but I think we're all a thoughtful play by play and political and now you're not thinking is that with her fault on our life\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually for bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy by ring true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiled\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices and yet how black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of Han seen black sentiments that have been shown check by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable ... anybody this I don't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country\nHe's a billionaire and he is a pack on that vicious horrible level\nI don't even know what to say my friend Heisman\nTrophy winning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and the questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to them is quote the\nFor example Adidas North America

I I definitely feel momentum the polls are showing momentum we now have if we go through all the states is a very tight race how old is up by two out in Arizona Mick Sally believe it or not is now what by six this was before the release of these tapes which I Believe is definitely going to hurt\nIn the case of of course in cinema\nMarsha Blackburn is up by eight in Tennessee that is such an

a partisan issue although we\nOh I don't think people like being lied to oh I don't like him wanted to do\nThat and I think the people on that you see them or not right wing or as the Democrats are moderate it just transcends the whole political issue is just don't\nLike to say one thing games they're all going to vote for Chuck Schumer all of them they're all going to be Chuck Schumer Democrats when they get\nThere and say that publicly then they say when it probably\nDid they what you're catching them doing is lying is it is systematic conscious lying to get power that's all it is never

release of the tape that we showed last night\nOf cinema and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona that she wants to vote for her\nCrazy I don't think that's going to go over well nor do I think it's going to go over well that she invited this\nThis radical attorney to Arizona State university ... or ... university a lawyer convicted of aiding and abetting an Islamic terror organization and its leader\nIn the lawyer in question represented someone who was one sentence to life in prison or sent a sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a plotting to blow up the UN and left the building so I think cinema is going to see a dramatic drop in the polls there and I think things will look up for Martha ... he was a rock star\nA person that has served their country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all the latest numbers and what it means and whether or not the this is going to be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over redux\nA we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shelters with us welcome both the back to the program\nThank you thank you get\nI don't think there's any doubt the cabin on overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence\nAs now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and cinema in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies and when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you know just a market went down its ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates\nBut in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they wouldn't want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slowed down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations and what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this was this week where I'm McCaskill is losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want jobs and what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your poultry to raise taxes take what you've got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has a fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nTo the house races you're talking about overwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where you know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit his looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively\nIn the direction of Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do\nI think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I Would kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York uh I've noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that\nI Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat that problem is not me at the end of\nIt stems cells are\nThe streaming service right now is whether it is\nThat there are because that's who they are they the conservative state certainly noticed that it's not a\nSimple number one Hans within a wife oh no me hang\nA 'em right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I Know I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina in South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be I mean I I've been doing and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I Am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nWhen I went off as you would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\nI John ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yeah I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nTed it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get for a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because\nYou really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be garden governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely going to should go period\nStyle absolutely and and does point about in previous times there have been on the radio as you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should have been on the edge should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nWell I think it's got to be harder than that I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if\nYou believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh Homer fall of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\n\nIf you suffer from E.
