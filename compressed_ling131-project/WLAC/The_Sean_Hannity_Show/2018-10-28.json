{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "I Am Charles Oliver welcome to hitting wealth Radiohead if you're just joining us fall of our radio shows are archived at hidden wealth radio dot com\nHave we been talking about the boomers two biggest success techniques that we have found that ultimately I've learned from the flow and\n... paid politicians to high income earners all the way to Big Ten football coaches that were just discussed in the ah the media this last week about putting two million into a strategy that has upside with no downside\nSo you have a floor of protection and which is what we call indexing but you money only participate when the market goes up\nAt double digit potential returns but does not participate when the market goes down and folks this has been part of our family's financial foundation now for well over Twenty years because I'm somebody likely like many of you listening that knows what it feels like to lose money and in light of what's happened just this last week\nWhere many people took us three percent tumble just in one day this last mid week day the fourth largest single point drop in art stock market history just transpired this last week\nAnd as the headlines read which I again this isn't a fear tactic this is just educate people CNBC reporter this last week there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts are watching the charts\nCNBC also said they're warning signs of a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go Amazon and it's a Facebook plummeted stocks a tech stocks recorded their worst day in seven years this past Wednesday and the folks the list goes on and on and on\nAnd it it's not good news because again what what's the reality here let's review the facts were nine and a half years into the longest Bull Run and stock market history\nRight no bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday\nIn the last time right that the second longest bull market being fueled by the dot com boom and then unfortunately the rally went bust in the nineties causes investors to lose nearly eighty percent folks I'm One of them\nI'm somebody that I'm going to teach you indexing versus investing that anchor down our family ... financial foundation and praise the lord I we had that but at the same time I got greedy as Warren Buffett talks about I did the opposite I he says be greedy when others are fearful that be fearful when others are greedy\nAnd I took too much risk and it it prompted all those years ago\nAre experiencing the loss of some of our families money into studying what the flu and the ultra wealthy have done for years and this is an interesting statistic that many people that I've had the opportunity to educate I'm not just a best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that\nHas written several books a two time best selling author and it all came from the things that I've learned from other people\nAnd then by applying these techniques and showing people how these techniques can work in conjunction with one another enables folks to discovered uncover their various areas of hidden wealth\nThat typically reside in the two biggest threats to boomers which end up being there two biggest success techniques and that is eliminating stock market crashes\nAnd eliminating unnecessary taxes\nTo getting rid of the crashes and taxes folks is not that difficult in other words having a stock market protection plan any unnecessary not to pay tax savings plan and it's all done through using the tax code\nRight judge hands several years ago said there's two types of of of taxes are in this country taxpayers I should say that he says there in this country the informed and the uninformed right however both are legal\nFocus is not deceptive tax evasion this strategic tax avoidance it's teaching people how to grow money without tax access their money without tax and transfer it without tax that's a savings in itself\nBut protecting yourself from this market volatility that I Believe is back right to lose eight hundred and thirty two points in one day this past week being the fourth largest single point drop and our stock markets history\nIs giving people the riding on the wall with many people predicting this happening well before now I myself have been teaching people how to get to see their serious retirement savings anchor down and secured\nTo not not just lot lose but folks it's called lock in and reset so let me spending just a minute on this for you because this may be one of the biggest breakthroughs the boomers have shared\nThat I'll be teaching this coming Tuesday or more specifically that I Want you to be able to learn more about right and people don't have as one clients that ... we don't have the time\nTo go through another major market meltdown we we do not have the time to recover and of course folks that's the big\nIn CERN dry but many people are caught off guard by these unnecessary taxes\nLet me teach you just a couple of quick techniques and I'll be teaching more about an in depth and detail this coming Tuesday lock in reset it's a unique provision in the engineering of how to to to structure your savings\nThat you're going to build a structured cash flow of of secure retirement income from so that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nIn the strategy is very simple as the market goes up your money isn't in the daily ups and downs and all around the stock market right especially with all this volatility but ironically the volatility itself actually makes this strategy better\nNow I Know that sounds kind of odd or counterintuitive so how can volatility helped me Chuck let's let's say about this when when the market has again our clients lock in that game never risk of giving net gain back\nWhich is not what anybody else has I can assure you [laughter] I I I personally sit with clients on a weekly basis and and I can't believe nor can they the exposure that they start to realize they have by some of our software analysis one just the other day with would lose fifty five percent of another oh wait market crash it\nAnd they can't afford that has no one could it but if the same time when there's again if locked in huge peace of mind sleeping better no worry right and when the market does lose there's the floor of protection\nSo it's a lock in but here's the key the reset\nSo if the S. and P. today let's say sell a thousand points\nAre clients don't lose they lock in any prior games not at risk of giving them back and then they get the advantage of the index that they're tracking only games not losses to Theresa sad at the lowest point\nTo start their next game right so the other words if the U.S and the loses a thousand points the folks have to wait for that thousand points to be made back before they start any new game our clients start their new game from the lowest level forward\nFolks that is huge that's a way to out Fox Wall Street and how we've been getting that done and helping clients secure they're serious retirement savings\nFor over two decades now here's the things I I Want to teach you this coming Tuesday so for those that have saved at least\nTwo hundred thousand or more are typically between the ages of forty five and Seventy five I don't care if you're getting to retirement or you're getting through retirement you can improve you can increase this isn't about playing it safe\nThis is about playing it strategically and this has outperformed the market this has outperformed the unnecessary taxes and it's helped people do a few things number one avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax to\nA number to avoiding having their retirement income tax\nA number three avoiding leaving a unnecessary inheritance tax to your kids or your grandkids and ultimately giving people the ability to live more and ironically leave more all without\nTax but also without the sleepless night concerns of when the market did thing right if you remember back when it did its thing an eight hundred point drop or an eight hundred point gain was the norm not the exception folks I think it's back\nAnd whether it's back or not can you honestly say you have a stock market protection plan and an unnecessary tax protection plan because you can um here some of the things I Want to teach you\nTax free liquidity having access when and how you needed\nMarket volatility protection right the uh the ... moving the uncertainty of when the next crash or drop or corrections takes place and ultimately with now running a seven hundred and eighty two billion dollar\nDeficit through twenty Eighteen right folks the riding on the wall where taxes have to go so here's the opportunity for those that registering the tin or the first fifty I Want to give to you my most recent book the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to a safe and secure retirement\nThey're good for the TV so you have a TV show no you do [laughter] around we'll put you on that I go to a one way\nDavid Limbaugh's you unless you're gonna love this pastor I Will say this pastor because you've been very good to me and you even said to me he prayed for me\nAnd I I I Am but I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything I'm I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us ... and ah and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense to you know are often times faces contagious and fates one can rub off one another phase breathe\nBasically you guys getting in my grilled Telhami Hannity you know you need to shape up the ship out [laughter] or Hannity you're going straight to hell live I can read your mind knew I Would never saw the way David ...\nBook is now a two week some running on the New York times bestseller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott and Cory\nThank you hey how're you guys thanks\nFor having me on what what start with this mob everywhere we\nSee we're not going to kick our ... I Would I ran into um what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation\nIf he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over to send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get the subtle out at the ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say fear with him we got him myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral [laughter]\n\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I have to wait another man of the ... that's why I say I have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me would come out if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it would go by what my response will go by but I think they pick and choose the targets\nDoes exactly well may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's ... it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter and ... and our other interaction\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nI look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these uh\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCalled today in orange\n... with only a [noise] a husky ... ... and west hamstring\nBenjamin Franklin captured lightning and about [noise]\n\n[noise]\nShe uses screens mayor or terrifying attractions in one\nLocation designed game\nRush Limbaugh we changed my Shakur you want\n[noise]\nWant all moments and final thoughts here from pastor Darrell Scott also agreements with it what is you have a last name right ... ... ... okay and David Limbaugh a David we'll give you thirty seconds by the last word thoughts today what's gonna happen to fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stave off the um the so called blue blue way that we might even retain the house\nAnd we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close that we don't win the house he need to keep it I think as the pastor Scott ... said\nWell there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around to Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black and I'm telling you liberals can't stand is\nA ... and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's uplifting we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two week how\nHow great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country has a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they can afford to vacations take the kids the does anyone there seven and be miserable but but they want to take their kids\nGo out to eat not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal listed humanity\nMissed it is I really believe you next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging\nAs long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this isn't a weapon formed against the self prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party shares\nRight good to see a both curry and we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us past are always good to see and when you're in New York my pre shit

Congress or in sixteen days this is it Fifteen days till election day\nA newly redistricted congressional district ten in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sex the three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of Pennsylvania's Supreme Court decision\nOr they decided to read the draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nAnd that's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us he's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they wanted to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it a to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlight it some of the things are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a showing you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for medicine it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the British you know the Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original bill out\nOf a you know the ... the replacement bill for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original bill didn't deal with pre existing conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew you know went and talked to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the bill that we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we\nBroke healthcare well let's all hardly they tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is well Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone I mean it will all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where you're going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want being forced by law to habits or penalized if they don't get it financially and then literally\nWe have to do this you on TALK radio not only three Fifteen W.

O. J. what's up Joe how are you glad you called sir\nJohn ... the number one supporter of Donald Trump in the country I think he's the best president moral history he needs to send troops down to stop this invasion and I think you would agree with that we just can't afford to take all these people and we we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt and so I Hope he will send troops down to stop this invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and\nYou know now they're trying to precipitate a crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this and yet you keep reading reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well bad food and water you know the goal is to get them up to a southern border but\nYou know what's happened to the seven thousand is going to be ten thousand more is it going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan\nYou know everybody would come here because mid term ...\nWell I think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of\nDue process and the presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and there are silent on Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mob that were out all all over the place this weekend\nAnd the success and failure Obama's failure Trump's success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote we'll see what happens in Fifteen days though Joe thank you eight hundred\nNine four one shown our number Brian is in Lexington, Kentucky Brian how are you and we're glad you called sir\nYes sir I was calling about the migration and the rush on our border and\nI Want to know what your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes organizing this basically committing treason and is that the Trump could find out where the FBI and you know maybe you need to look into that and find out exactly who's you know hashed out this big plan now that we know what's going on\nWell listen we know what's going on we know that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country income racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can't have what do you know you can't have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us in or were horrible people uh especially when the only place they can seek asylum is the first country they get to that would be Mexico and Mexico obviously didn't have the will lower desire to do anything in this case\nAnyway appreciate the call eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part\nOf the program you are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show don't forget casting\nSean Hannity show weekdays right here on this station and stay tuned for more right after the latest news [noise]\nAll right so I've been telling you about my pillow it helps me fall asleep pastor and stay asleep\n... well my friends at my pillow have done it again with their mattress top or now you need to get this because it will literally changed your life in a positive way for ever now is Michael and Dell's exclusive\nThree layer design it includes my pillow phone for support transitional bone to help relieve pressure points\nMine's getting sicker every day I mean I noticed the same thing the Maxine Waters\nYou know you get a crowd and you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess maybe taking a meal home to somebody else and throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurts severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his bat brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president and held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of\nBlue collar Americans that won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much and I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors Asian the caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue it's a galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's\nThing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credential judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump\nTwitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so once again he's going to defy logic here I think we've got a very good chance to possibly\nAh keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy into for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say the CBs carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the mass of foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary belt Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw such charm ... will cut their answer possible\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of

in\nOn the [noise]\nI\nAn ... what's going on\nIn the morning [noise] and they didn't want to be like\nYou know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director and Washington DC campaign office\nOr speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once you\nAnd the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the cast school have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bomb it looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down and when the press calms is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to moderate voters and play to the progressive base\nWell we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it and I just have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to lose a moderate and that and they can only make one choice\nOne but he did not have a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett is then hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well Dave\nThough it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera ties\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it it her way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio in talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else on if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nAnd how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nSmith conduct to create a short course some crypto investing to help you learn prepare for\n... everything from crypto currency or how they work out of buys

got to monitor the media closely here because they're not talking about violence against Democrats are but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nI think you know I I I think you should give it a little ...\nI you know we got we got something happened in the southwest in the southeast and the thing that's remarkable about these states we've already have them are getting a little bit more we still want to\nCover people in play is the theme there's supposed to represent their states their constituencies but they say they don't they say it's all about Schumer it's all about the national wave we don't care about our own people in the states that are going to the next week\nAll right great work project ... dot
