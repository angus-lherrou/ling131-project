Fox News sources telling punch the FBI supplemental report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is expected to be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as today\nAnd you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case\nAbout what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation and I'm wanting to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all\nPresumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos they on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people to have a right to see this\nI think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the case of professor Ford\nFor example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind and no one backing up her story including the one person that she\nPlaced in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out missed Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Michael I have a nominee alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drug ... almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties\nBut as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior how does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in Brett Kavanaugh I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation that somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that\nYou have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe Felice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight why he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just fall a fine for someone who sent U.S Supreme court [noise]\nJuly we need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves by hand truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward neither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight\nAnd he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nIn further claimed afford never voiced any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said there were four people that could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story\nMost don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point\nYou've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to asked the same questions\nIf they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now\nBased on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe in a suit\nOh that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee\nI'm just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all that matters Lindsey Graham is saying Clintons sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I\nI think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves\nAnd we'll see

to impeach the president they want to investigate all things president what do you think this Fifteen page expos they in the New York times is all about number one\nThey've they figure it out the

police to keep protesters at bay head of a confirmation vote on the Supreme Court nominee boxes Geron helper and on the hill\nThat was Lindsey Graham has been very powerful ...\nThese hearings and he had a moment last week during those hearings were Brett Kavanaugh on Dick Durbin wanting is FBI investigates the alright they've had the FBI investigation\nNow we know that we can have an up or down vote in the Senate so who's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party\nThat in every single case even though there is no cooperation even though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know a data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen and the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis to rape girls are lining up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups\nThat's what that evolved into you know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is\nFor every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window Newt\nGingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback while I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know you can't have shame\nIf you're only interest is raw power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power of the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil such\nRaw power or the kind of smearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really to the Democrats that would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh there'll only do it I Believe if in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England this week it most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency a judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smear treated with a\nVicious personal in fact all those things I think means that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper\nUnderlying lesson\nAll of us should learn about who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president for the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire\nCaucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn hands specific items in the first hundred days of which you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats Democrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama\nWe've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you weren't resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president has set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe've got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence or the night he said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to do but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be\nWe want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs from ... from opioid deaths are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana\nA U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill of Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course now that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember it and you remember 'cause your air two thousand six two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all they are trying to destroy Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wager campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted by what they just saw\nHappened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election\nI got to take a quick break from our nation's capital more with Newt Gingrich on the other side later on Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing and much more as we continue from the swamp from the sewer it's Sean Hannity show\nBy the way if you like me and you hate weak weak coffee I hate it\nIs brought you buy maximus smart security lights at Costco\nCameras are everywhere so why not install some around your home I recommend maximus brand they a flood lights in Port sites with a camera in motion sensor easy installation you can even talk to the person at your door plus ... video maximus available Cosco [noise]\nFrom the accurate whether ... through your talk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen tend to hold you will see for cash when we made the upper eighties today not far away from our record from Eighteen eighty four of Ninety One degrees will be even\nCloser tomorrow's another Ninety remark Seventy are warm Wilson I supposed to be fifty some years stray storm tomorrow you're Ninety hour by the accurate mortgage group Scott worrying more than what the CIA [noise]\nOr talk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ...

keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason these public figure uh so I don't believe each going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job opening up the ... year\nUh I mean if we're if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs in high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't discuss I mean this is crazy it's crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nI I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney Adam pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... by the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan

many people get their humor lapdog but they might get out of their own political okay for\nA loop Beckley right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think\nI don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski and play\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I mean [laughter] don't\nReal does wrong principle is man that stands on

all of a sudden you're accusing somebody\nOf something and it gets printed by the New Yorker and the New York times of all places well they spend an entire week calling dozens of people and they learn that the accuser is calling former classmates asking them if they remembered what happen because the accuser saying to them well she's not really sure what happened\nThen you've got the whole well they were putting drugs and they were ... girls almost on a weekend basis I went to tend to these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of them men and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train rate because they were lying in the hall and then not balls into while I saw him near the punch bowl\nAnd and I saw him give red solo cups to people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top and the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases\nNo car operation not in the case of professor Ford not the case of Mr Ramirez and not in the case with Julie sweat Nick know co-op corroboration\nJoe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing ... will be back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners to know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's uh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers how ... you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California's she's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts is there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have now examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview but they are today anyway\nThe eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that miss what may\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is most of the education for her story\nThere is no substitute education permits Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nOh I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who\nOr whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise I remembered Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes together a radical left wing activist resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats\nNever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace\nAnd also defended and in the case of Al Franken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes\nWell but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are\nFor safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats are they just they just now have pushed this so far\nInto a ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever\nAnd we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning I I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and is and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent the shorter than happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and picking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes
