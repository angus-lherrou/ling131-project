of law due process equal justice under the law equal application of our laws and no presumption of innocence\nWhy would you give power to a party that has an agenda to basically\nIn any way they can find go on a witch hunt to destroy a duly elected president rather than just try to defeat him and the twenty twenty elections\nWhy would you go along with the party that seems to be perfectly fine with the abuse of power at the top echelon of our FBI and R D OJ\nWhy would that the ones that protected Hillary Clinton when it was the biggest slam dunk case of obstruction than we've ever had in the history of obstruction of justice\nWhy would you reward a party that was willing to disseminate false information about Mitt Romney never paying taxes and Mitt Romney\nA being a must ... because he had women's work applications and a party that every two and four years I can chronicle and I will chronicle for you you know accuses Republicans of being racist and sexist massage genetic\nHomophobic even a phobic Islamic phobic that they weren't dirty air and water and they want to kill children in some look alike is gonna of a candidate is going to throw granny over the cliff\nWhat did they do with the eight years of power you gave them under Obama you know the statistics if if you listen to the show for any length of time I'll repeat them repeat them because this is what they want to go back to an twenty nine days\nBecause there are the single greatest abysmal failure in the history of the\nCountry Thirteen million more Americans in on food stamps eight million more Americans in poverty that's eight years of Obama lowest labor participation rate\nSince the seventies I mean think about it where it's recovery since the forties lowest homeownership rate in

more manufacturing jobs than we've had and the last Thirty years\nThat's helping real Americans real families have a real life in a real future for their kids and grandkids it's not hard are complicated to understand what people want in life\nYou know people want a nice house in a state I'm looking for mansions they want a nice house in a safe neighborhood you know maybe even a pool of digging up to an extra\nYou know they want to drive a decent car or truck they want to be able to go to dinner you know a couple of times a month and not worry that they can't pay for it\nThey want to

infinitely better deal with Canada\nAnd that's one of the whole thing started as they want to kill brand new improved granny over the cliff\nHere I've got you want to know what the agenda in there in twenty nine days is we've got it on tape\nBy\n[noise]\n\nI think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine\nAnd its role as a way that it is being in the third and work I have any

for instance and President Trump yes they have strayed so far from the Internet than the American people and the interests of humanity or we need to we need to abolish it\nWhen the American people learn that some of them are not getting anything some of them getting raises and the rest are getting from and big corporations and wealthy individuals are getting nice fat pieces of pie they're going to be outraged they are already\nPrices and doing what it was created to do it's being used as his own\nPersonal a police force and in those actions it's actually making us less safe\nWhen this country understand and fails what has been done with a tax scam or at what that's going to do for our deficit in this country is going to be reverse\nAnd I think we imagine and during the agency with a very different mission and take those conditions out and so we believe that\nWe should protect families that need our help and that's not what I think today and that's why I Believe you should get rid of what\nWe have proposed as an increase in the corporate tax rate\nThan anybody cabinets [laughter]\nWe need to breathe or immigration from above the ... something that we're\nMedicare for all is actually much more and it's actually much chip arts and crafts and that will pay right now\nThey say Maxine please don't say impeachment anymore [laughter]\nI'll say impeachment if [laughter]\nIf it

investigated than ice in the house will have to do investigate we would have to investigate\nUnbelievable that's the choice you have been twenty nine days\nAre you going to reward this behavior are you going to allow would they did so took literally put these people in power if you've not been particularly interested in a midterm election until now well this would be the perfect time to wake

eight five five nine four B. I. B. L. E. vinegar trap immediately\nAfter ... on on the radio and I read some\nOf\nThe role on Sean Hannity's show will continue a lot of breaking news what are you going to do in twenty nine days [noise]\n\nAbout life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens\nWhen you call ... life for example Georgia's forty he was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select what age and dance\nThat is relevant to our advisors consent duty\nLet me ask you John sale I Know you've been in more than a few political battles in your life and we watched this process unfold\nI mean and it got worse and worse you know literally crescendo wing at what when Michael ... represents a woman that claims almost on a weekend basis that young girls were more systematically drug boys lining up in the hall to rape them one after another and and that was a normal weekend\nAnd that would happen and not just once for multiple times and no parent loan no law enforcement do teacher a was ever told ever\nAll your years in the prosecutor's office would you be a bit suspicious of that story\nWell you'd be more than a bit suspicious I mean you just rejected out of hand but showing going forward there's something very special about the Supreme Court you know the fact that the confirmation was fifty to forty eight it's not like where I'm trying to be the point spread\nAdjust its now justice cabin on so long ago judge Kavanaugh he was confirmed and the Supreme Court just must be above the fray and not send out political signals and I think the editorial he wrote we said the op ed that he was going to be independent impartial\nObviously he will be and I just hope that it does not ... the awful things that have happened in the last week did not affect the public's confidence in the independence of the Supreme Court\nI think it's going to be interesting and then what we have to ask the question will the party that was responsible for all of this will there be a price to pay in twenty nine days well I mean in other words I talk about every election Republicans a racist or sexist massage in is\nHomo phobic dean of well because ... they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill granny I enrolled her over a cliff and they want to kill children well now with you know cold hangers being sent and and there it it just the same tactics as those\nTactics I think are backfiring on the Democrats and all of the activists in protesters and and these special interest groups the polling data Sean is very revealing there was some apathy among Republicans as is often the case in a midterm election\nAnd suddenly that changed and transformed GOP voters into energized and motivated voters to get out on\nElection day next month because they see what is going to happen if they lose the house and the Senate because Nancy Pelosi and Jerry ... who would then become\nA chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats win the house are vowing to a ... exact or van ... a ...\nInvestigation to remove calving off those from the Supreme Court by virtue of articles of impeachment and and there's nothing that will motivate of Republican voters more than that\nKind of what to undermine the Democratic process of confirmation and to try to stabilize the Supreme Court for partisan reasons\nWell going to be interesting to watch do you think politically John you watched a lot of campaigns is they're going to be as big as the American people gonna be motivated in twenty nine days and are they going to remember this\nWell I Can't read the tea leaves\nBut what we just saw the confirmation battle actually was a sample of our separation of powers inaction were each branch exercise it's appropriate role and now in our democracy the people are going to decide and you know they're going to be irresponsible lawyers\nWho are going to come go on T. V. shows with more people who are claiming I should have been interviewed\nI could have told this town and I just hope that people can separate the wheat from the ...\nHas a prosecutor looking at these three cases how would you handle them thirty six years later in each case no corroboration in each case\nUh well uh with I don't know anything beyond what's in the public record but without cooperation you might entertain a meeting for an hour or two and say thank you for coming by a does nothing to talk about\nUm okay so when when professor board for example she can't remember a location\nShe can't remember an exact date or a place not he's struggling to know the year in the case of ms ... she's calling other fellow students from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweat neck who who made the you know change her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out the week before I mean you if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for that one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses\nAnd but I think some of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their\nOr you know and the and the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil case is a good man was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official war to confirm that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to go after Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean Greg Jarrett\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton Russia\nCollusion she had on her payroll British spy a who is using Russian sources and now we've learned through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top\nUh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed to him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the ... lawyer\nA shoe you know this is astonishing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it was corroborated a federal regulations are very clear\nYou may not submit the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated and yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are classified and the inspector general has a has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant you know the basis of bulk of the information in the ... the application John was the unverified\nAre uncorroborated ... the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those that I mean that was and he has to be held accountable for that well\nLet's wait and see when the documents of declassified but the answer the question is of course uh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is\nEverything you're talking about should be thoroughly investigated but I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation\nCan conclude by showing independently that the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing and it doesn't have to be one of the ... and not necessarily linked\nWould they would he have an obligation see this is what frustrates me I think that the the mandate was so broad that we ended up going into people's you know main bank loan applications from years gone by to me is just ridiculous the considering where it was supposed to start and where it was supposed to go\nOr what did not lead to an important issue especially of Russian lives were paid for and disseminated to the American people to purposely lie to them before an election and worse than that used to\nUse them five buys applications to spy on an opposition party candidate and then use later to destroy a presidential uh about president who was duly elected\nWell a hundred percent and if those things are verified the people involved should be held responsible criminally but I'm saying that the bowler investigation of itself\nCan conclude by showing the president didn't do anything wrong one of the dangers of a special counselor or a special prosecutor is they have only one\nCase so they're on a mission but what I've always believed is if a special counsel does a thorough investigation and concludes that in this case the president did not do anything wrong he that special counsel has not failed\nSo what can businesses expect in today's hiring market which has changed a lot in the last two years\nWell Shawn to spring was the first time in nearly Twenty years at the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people with this we're seeing some creative benefits being offered to alert top talent\nAnd what can job seekers look for in this market\nWhere we did a survey of our franchise owners in film it taught for ... lives in attracting and retaining workers were wages in bonuses naturally family benefits education and training in workplace culture\nWhat about business owners or managers can you share examples of some of these initiatives\nBusinesses or expanding leave and benefit policies to include elder care and offering flexibility to address things such as child care and transportation also wages are increasing as well including raises in sign on bonuses\nSo it really sounds like a job seekers market right now what else can you share\nCompanies are looking for ways to offer growth and development within the business

know ... what do you want me to wear a wire around the president\nWell he has a lot to answer for and the president I'm sure it spoke to him about it on air force one today did did you really try to get people to secretly record me ... ... did you recruit people\nTo invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment to me from office now we know Rosenstein is going to not deny it whenever he's caught a engaging in illicit if not illegal activity she claims his words were misinterpreted over and over again we've seen examples of that\nA threat to the intelligence committee staff threats to Devon newness oh I'm just misunderstood Rosenstein must be the most misunderstood man in Washington DC but it would be imprudent politically for the president to fire him he has no intention of doing show sign\nYou know must receive Mueller's report and I think the president wants to see how that will play out and I think it's beginning to wind down many of the people on Muller staff of already left in return their jobs at the department of justice so I think that is reaching a conclusion I agree with John\nNo collusion no structure and a and then let's launch a serious\nInvestigation with a grand jury and the people at the department of justice and the FBI\nWho engaged in this what I Believe to be an illicit illegal scheme to frame Donald Trump\nWill take a break here but we got to say goodbye to Greg

that application is specifically walk once pages ten through twelve and Seventeen the thirty four they're also looking for the D O D J what are known as real twos\nAnd those are the conversations between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann in Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some document we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from\nBut some of the key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting a immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday this week [laughter]\nUh we are going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of\nThis and I said do you know what the news is tomorrow do getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere there there we have people that know that was there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm hearing a lot of\nThe ... coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work\nBrought you that you often would be the brief by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligent I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any\nInternational relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy to share\nInsights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that ... does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia that added the\nDNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at ... I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh endless of first happened\nIn August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a literal ... say\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think\nFirst ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at\nThe time ... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged ...\n... ... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to a ... a lot about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah and basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment\nOf ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you gonna do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some recourse for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that has created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that\nYou should write a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like because I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and I'm going back many years again at\nAnd we had talked about many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total over the last two years out of the last two decades two years as two years\nWell I mean in terms of actually in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of document production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nWhen you went before a mall or what\nWas that like you know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they have been\nA less leaky in terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I don't remember that night but I Will I keep an eye back at all absolutely not and\nYou haven't you know and as the is it now they now stopped asking you questions one of the last time he got a call from anybody\n[noise] I haven't uh I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen oh at all the whole year and it's like a year's worth of freedom well you know if I'm not worried about freedom for me I'm\nGod's Neal is
