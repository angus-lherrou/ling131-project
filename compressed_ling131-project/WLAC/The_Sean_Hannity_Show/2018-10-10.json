the coast through Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina\nAnd then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline kept five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher I'm over ... million power outages we expect to occurring\nAnd not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is gonna be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in if you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make your

move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst the worst hurricane ever\nFor the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes it when we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow\nSame thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening\nThoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim combing he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money\nIt was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal defense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now\nLisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview\nAnd insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath he's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail\nThey don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said\nOn Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein\nAnd have him testify under oath did he or did he not as Lisa Page\nAs McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying\nDiddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment either he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talked about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application\nAs it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns you know that it was an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the five applications including the last one and there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information pertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hate it Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there's no there there\nBut anyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which has Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint rod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy\nRobert Mueller but there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nOr judiciary committee's outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a raft musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power and twenty seven days we have in Arizona mix Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero and\nAh anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three [noise]\n\nHey I'm

Georgia get when sit near hurricane force from\nA storm that hit all the way down or close to three hundred miles or two hundred and fifty miles\nThere's anything I could speak to in this Saturday well then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that most senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extensive oversight I don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations\nAnd then Rand Paul asked director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up\nBy the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with\nSay a terrorist name and the and re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abused within the ... system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as\nJames Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered\nWith no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years and I got to admit after nine eleven I thought it was a great idea never having any any belief that it was possible\nAs naive as I guess I was\nThat we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ that would literally be weaponized sing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them\nTo protect we the people that I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate\nHim put together a flimsy dusty a\nWith Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer warrant application but not one for the original application and three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate\nAnd that it was never verified corroborated but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it by swearing you know we'll get into this\nYou know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later\nI mean think about that this is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to\nA Pfizer surveillance warrant\nAnd what has happened here is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal ever\nThat we've got three people on record saying that Rod Rosenstein well he has a plan hatched to surreptitiously record the president the hopes that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd he won't even testify under oath to no end Congress's letting gonna let him get away with that Trey Gowdy is going to let him get away with that Bob Goodlatte is going to let them get away with

David they gotta Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein and we all\nKnow that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for\n... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't wanna have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there is no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more uh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nInterview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker of the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness as you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nAnswer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got a subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath\nAnd want to talk about your whole security protecting your family that simply said home security the best\nSecurity system on the market even said by the net PC Magazine a wire cutter is their

I. B. L. E.\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall today and we'll start\nOn radio not only three and then\n\nWe can you congressman Jim\nJordan and congressman Mark Meadows All right so the next step\nThat is what that means do I do I need to give out the numbers of Trey Gowdy is office\nAnd chairman good last office and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein why why I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's\nPhone number in your ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it your list interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understand how important this is\nBut the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that\nThe deputy attorney general much caught me at a bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that are really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nHad not shown we need to see that\nWe need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr ... told us that after each conversation he had with\nGlenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person that the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those\nSo the so called trio too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see more importantly the American people need to say\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on and\nThey should demand that he testify under oath a thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth we need to get to the bottom of the [noise]\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we got a lot more to come down ... more on this also the latest on this hurricane that his pounding the Florida Panhandle as we speak hurricane Michael I'm much more Hannity tonight nine eastern on the Fox news channel we got a great show will tell you about that in a minute [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHi Michelle milk and hear the gods now movie opens in October twelve dean Cain and the entire cast was her job bringing the during the big screen\nHow the woman goes into a funny comes out of there is no police report\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist massage units you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time we had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back down we'll get back\nYou up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nIt would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining\nOr does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote have legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation a ... that they've built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is done and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the end you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it bother you that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it's a host and and a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not\nAll of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump Supreme Court nominee Paul the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money and those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's faith and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on\nA on a regular basis for Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach math to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible or for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people\nAre are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than ... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity\n'em and add money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like Kevin McCarthy introduce which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he couldn't make as many as more and more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nNear future ... and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut as Greg can tell you most of these cases that are very important to American businesses American individuals\nMoms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection it may come open I ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually\nWorried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential\nSix three conservative majority and the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen quick\n\nAll right so I've been telling you about my pillow it

devastating than we even thought it could be\n[laughter] well we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I I you know and my dad used to always say me see if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so uh it was actually is that we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks\nThe first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf\nRight now you said it right on this show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up for\nEverything got together and that's why you see that every once in awhile but let me put it in perspective is the worst storm ever to hit between ... camp I that I can find on records okay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something that we're ... we're not I'm not sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your SUV\nAll right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up pretty far in advance is also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years\nIncluding Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that ... that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening
