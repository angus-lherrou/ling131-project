our thoughts and prayers [noise]\nYou know and you watch some of these people out there pulling out all the stops all weekend long too high Saturday Saturdays anti Semitic master gr to Trump\nIs too big facts getting in the way while the Republican Party rejects anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders\nI never get in a room with Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about as anti Semitism and his racism\nThe shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish and and so on and so forth you know apparently a\nYou know as Ron ... rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these burial an anti Semite can come from any side of the\nPolitical spectrum and if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've rented we studied it they've gone through it all\nAnd we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary all these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel or president said we will see their destruction\nWhich is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people have been you know victims of anti Semitism\nYou know Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump\nThe evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever and what an act of courage was apparently but there's other presidents have promised that never did it and making Jerusalem\nThe rifle capital of Israel [noise] anyway we're going to get to all of that that Fox News similarly under attack I've got all the latest numbers on the election um I'm also going to tell you if right now I Would say the Republicans in eight days my prediction is today I'll give you one every day there's any updates\nThey pick up seats in the Senate\nBut I think we're down in the

as we all stay a main\nSpeaking after the synagogue massacre amen to old but he just said there you know we've had\nA lot leading up to all of this and you go back to the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't hear many people on the left to cry the angry mobs that were going on in the halls of Congress I I got to the point where I said probably it's better if we cleared the halls of the public\nOr you would think in the people's house that the people would be allowed to go where they are elected officials are but it was obviously becoming unsafe for people senators being spit at you saw the treatment of\nYou know we've had in recent weeks what do we have rice and sent or what was supposed to be rice and sent to Susan Collins home\nDuring the cabin or hearing slope coat hanger sent to her office et cetera\nWe've watched than in recent weeks racing or what they've said ... rice and being sent to the president\nAnd General Mattis and our FBI Director right and our CIA director Gina Haspel we watched the last few weeks what we watch these mobs and people being run out of restaurants\nYou know Sarah Sanders and our kids\nAnd family secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Ted Cruz Mitch McConnell airports and having his table slammed in his food thrown out the restaurant door\nI've been telling everybody that the rhetoric is too hot and too heated and people need to come down but nobody on the Democratic side ever decided to stand up and say this this has got to stop\n\nOn this program I set it when Obama was president it's got to stop we got to protect our elected officials the day that they mailed this the first device was sent the George Soros his house first thing I said on the radio I said we've got ... this can happen in this country\nI Know he's not a fan of mine in any of the people that were threatened by these bombs\nBut the rush to politicize this and turn this into well this is who conservatives are is just one big lie\nWhat you're watching unfold before you're very eyes is you know the race to politicize tragedies thank God those twelve or Thirteen PVC bombs didn't go off and nobody lost their life thank\nGod but that wasn't Donald Trump's fault\nAnd then you can you know look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue but this rabbit anti Semite racist and also a Trump ... not that it should even be relevant\nIt's getting scary we\nHad real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up a Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the\nLocal county Republican headquarters police set of worker arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities\nWe have another threat of a man has accused the guy who's been arrested by threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo that story came out this week it he's been threatened there was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn\nIt's not true it's never been true\nAnd it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill and anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing\nThat narrative you know this is you know watch watching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable Fox deserve their headlights Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility\nOh I've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know in the mainstream media\nHave been my entire career friends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades than there during the war and been there and other times reporting showing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them\nFriends who they who Brock formally Shimon Peres let's name names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate and lives are inciting extremist oh this extreme is in the synagogue hated Trump\nThose are the Washington Post headlights that you got\nFrom the G O P defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people on CNN fake news they couldn't identify 'em up for who they are these phony hypocrites\nTrump blames and you know something when the media live twenty four seven and they get called out that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living in now here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch column\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nMaybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard ... possible people in New Jersey clearly\nFed up with ... then I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why Floridians are flirting with Guillaume ... got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and\nHe'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Christ in ... cinema well we've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban can win in Arizona and calling her own state crazy and the meth lab of democracy and inviting radical lawyers for the blind shake I don't know how she survives\nHeidi Heitkamp I don't think she's going to win a North Dakota that'll be a pickup as long as the people of Indiana don't vote for the libertarian and split the ticket the Republican their Braun should be able to win that race and that would be a pickup for Republicans\nI think Montana's a little bit and play but I'd say favoring pastor at this moment protest or can be beaten there and I think the biggest thing is I'm looking at real clear politics and the battle for the house race they have two hundred and five likely Democrats and Republicans two hundred\nAnd the rest you have some thirty tossup states that have gone to\nDefine or tip the balance of power John James\nBy the way is now only within six against Avon out he was one soundbite twenty\nYou'd be he's a totally great rising star in the Republican Party and I think it'd be great we'll see what happens but you know I think the house can slip so there are three possible scenarios\nA week from this Wednesday the day after one is Republicans rock the world and shocked the world again and they help hold on to the house\nPick up Senate seats that's the ideal for eight days and there's a split decision they hold on to the Senate pick up seats but it's speaker elect below sea\nThat's split decision and the worst case scenarios speaker elect Pelosi and Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer all these important\nRace as we have on Hannity dot com thank you Linda for reminded me hey listen you've got to keep your home and family

us eight hundred nine four one showing toll free telephone number eight days till election day one week from a tomorrow that was the president talking about the Pittsburgh should have gone to synagogue shooter\nUm we're wedding getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill and anti\nSemite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know took heat for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those says we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rose I'm very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nAnd his son and you are so loved in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear that list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood I go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the the ... moving too\nSo we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's ... and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but\nAs soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political and\nIt's like you can count the seconds ... ... there's an interesting side no to those little throw those to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged with Farrakhan and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nA ... any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out\n... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling the Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate bomb a nation what climate dizzy away just wrote a press release about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ...\nPraises resume or day ah terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she has been praised by Christ in dealing with a friend\nShe's it praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter those things matter a great deal as it should be expected when you're normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expected\nAll the way that our average she went to put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree we we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic have he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson and Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral and he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd sign if I may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because I I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have the Pittsburgh affiliate\nRight here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hand they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination if he were influence\nAnd they said you're in the past three years you're working your policies have\nInviting theft and involved in this\nAnd the you know what Sean what's interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls from listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now is not representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said\nPeople are are there and obscure left wing group I'm a very progressive chase and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everything with David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscure\nPeter Beinart as a matter of that group that's an Israeli faster and hater from start to finish\nRecorded then George Soros his grandson is a member of the group that report to speak to this ... for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... it's a wonderful place they're not haters they're not people who want to politicize anything and the president by the way can't win for losing\nThe guy who says those pipe bombs around\nUh people claim he was a follower of President Trump this guy the shooter the killer in Pittsburgh it's president from it called him a global is there's no longer insulting work world\nConservatives by in large mainstream conservatives David are the biggest supporters of Israel in this country I've been friends with prime minister Netanyahu for twenty five years friends with a ... and and Shimon Peres a and others\nThat frog you broadcast from Israel you have been a great friend of Israel patrol hundred percent right and on foot look there been articles lately there's an entire stream of the Democratic party now\nThat is frankly Israel haters and not give up past the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez these new people on the scene the Palestinians and the massacre\nIt's just not true they're peddling wise about Israel and that's very very dangerous if you believe words matter\nWords matter this was the deadliest anti Semitic attacking us history the president also saying we will seek their destruction which I agree with\nI got to take a break but we'll come back more with rose tenant and David shown on the other side I saw a friends would show many have done it again right if you look in the mirror what do you see maybe a little bit of sag along your jaw line um remember ... when he gets rid of bags and pumping this Sunday your eyes at the number one best selling product it can get it in any store\nAnd don't forget there's sunspot correctly you had a little too much sun in the summertime\nOsama is now done it again they're introducing their brand new Gen you sell jaw line treatment would do\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer\nStage four and here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without ... sure\nIt's worth looking into there is the reason is is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five Ninety four Bible at eight five five nine four B.

eight hundred diaper one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program Ralph Reed is back with us a he is the founder the chairman of the faith and freedom\nCoalition and CEO of of century strategies and look he was part of the Christian Coalition back in the day when they paid played such a powerful force in American politics in many ways he has rebuilt the Christian Coalition in terms of\nGetting out mailers and and making contacts with voters all around the country key races\nNow in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and Ron dissenters has a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle\nYou got a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is it and we have British students team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers per brought us in calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall\nBut people have got to get out the vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that pony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is down by double digits she also was exposed by project very toss a we now have in a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat\nAnd only the only factor there that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing vote so away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly we've got a hold the seat\nHeller seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend showing Christian send them other Democrat up on war hero twenty eight year veteran\nSix tours of duty Iraq and Afghanistan Martha McSally especially with cinema calling the people of Arizona crazy and saying Arizona's the\nMeth lab of democracy and inviting the attorney for the blind shake to Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven I was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with it anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us\nThat's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nI'd do Sean we're ah we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day we think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had in a midterm election\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I looked at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignore the press ignore the Hondas do your job get the ...\nAnd everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay by it but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening but as I was out on the road I also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic\n'em and you could see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate and they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shocked the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision where Republicans get seats in the Senate but below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up\nYou know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want because we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a vote for ... if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate\nThe two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know you see different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president we\nHave a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me she was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThere were over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on a jumbo Tron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity ... quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's

Kavanaugh is playing a part in this I think the Democrats none of them have spoken at all about the caravan their sounds has been definite you know and then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and Xena phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks till\nYou know seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida\nWe saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican Congress but yeah I have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left\nYou see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country\nA love for their fellow man and hope for a better future for all of our citizens staying positive stay prayer fall and work hard\nYou know I when I was coming up Sean and me in the eighties I had a friend of mine who was running for Congress he had a sign in the campaign headquarters I never forgot it said work like it all depends on you and pray like it all depends on God that's not a bad way to live then it's not a bad way to live

unlawfully does become immigrants\n... means establishing a responsible pathway to earn citizenship\nAll right no news round up information overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border or a significant\nThe display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given\nSpecial consideration to work in southern Mexico or but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend in a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis sees a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience and conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column here but what if my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question right on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or for somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of\nOf the president who basically tried to uh overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life they are in bed with the Venezuelan and laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our world and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the more\nSo in a great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people that the and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a with a necessity it does not seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period\nWhich don't simply ... to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting the status stuff if that's the principal\nWell when I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he says and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with the sun shine we don't want anybody hurt and also it is undoubtedly true but most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to the gun I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply lose HUD really as human shields on Conan harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built\nUm I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence and on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even\nAnd then on the other side of the fence or you know a million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there as things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way and it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument is just what we have to do for our own safety\nThat will without question of what you just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the border that we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here\nBecause that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion\nI mean obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of you know\nRight we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com they're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax knock on doors help neighbors get to the polls\nTotal solution to any type of work he would ever want to do around your house\nAnd basketball it's completely free though to how many by their dot com or download for free and\nYet they're few minutes away on TALK radio Ninety eight points dream\nThat when you went to the\nRight as we head back to her busy telephones\nEight hundred dying for one Sean is our number All right let's get to our busy telephones Liam is in Raleigh in North Carolina what's up Liam how are you glad you call him is a special name around here you want to know why why that Sean\nBecause lenders baby boy who's now what he's three he is named William and so that's off limits sent us all of a video of her take on a day off and play hooky last week and she went pumpkin picking limb\nAnd ... goes out their member of three year old kid he picks up a pumpkin about about his size\nAnd he's really struggling to carry it and then they dropped it in the road and the pumpkin roles away and then you could hear Linda saying only bleep we aren't you going to get the ... pumpkin you got to let it roll the way it goes yup [laughter] I don't\nKnow what he said yep Bye bye pumpkin\n... I'm getting and I'm laughing you keep trying to you know entice them Liam know get the ... that is that the one to Liam get by get to tell you all getting them out because that's what you do if I get to three you're gonna have to sit in a pumpkin patch I'm gonna leave you here\nAnyway [laughter] and I would live on a head on\nI Am I I'm I'm Down here and Robert but I'm formerly from Ron talk out there on the island or um [noise] the reason why I'm calling and I appreciate you taking my call but the reason why I'm calling is I think you Rush Limbaugh and going back a downplaying this red wage\nI don't think it's the right way and I think it's a rich nominee the Democrats are getting fed up with allies and the ... the deception ... you know Hillary and all that and that's really getting sicker and ... uh by the name Trump so I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I tried to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know if the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats where\nIf the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and I'm ... I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nBlurry frankly I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans if they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBut there's Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman it just it's a disaster for us eight hundred ... when Shaun are toll free telephone number [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThe IRS scandal and then as a atrocities convince you to you and you don't watch dog Don Washington with insiders sources you need to be every day\nYou know ...\n... Golding\nLord of the small business back home or\nAm already knows who's running for Congress to\nI'm already know Simon I approve\nGlad you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but they are\nThat they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians dissent among can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest polls beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exact even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of
