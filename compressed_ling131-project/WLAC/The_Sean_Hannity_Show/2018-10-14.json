Lincoln act and their money I mean\nWhat more can you give me one check Oliver understand well Lucian ... your retirement on track in retirement protected dot com that's retirement protected dot com [noise]\nIf you'd like to protect yourself from taxes inflation market losses and economic uncertainty you're doomed to the right place [noise] malefactor jumped all over them hidden wealth radio [noise]\nHi this is your God overwhelming to hid wealth radio here if you're just joining us all of our radio shows are archived it hidden wealth radio dot com [noise] well we've been talking about the tax cut to point though and we've been talking about the impact because the two point oh just passed the house this last week\nWhich I'm excited about making the tax cuts permanent now that's a that's a whole because there's still got some ways to go\nEspecially of Trump's impeached and this tax sale that have been teaching people about has everything to do with what you shift in time so if you don't remember anything else I share with you remember the words shifting in timing as we like to say in our practice shift\nHappens but it happens with strategy and we've been talking about a Forbes article they talked about why we have this retirement crisis really comes down to the basics like when you think about football comes down to the basics of blocking and tackling\nWell folks in in the world in the realm of retirement planning it comes down to number one Forbes says having a plan\nAnd I've talked about a few clients that we've met with your friends and neighbors boomers typically between the ages of sixty and Seventy five those have you predominantly saved at least a quarter million or more towards retirement between husband and wife\nAnd likely it's in a tax deferred account now remember with all these tax cuts\nThere's going to have to be a heyday of when somebody's gonna have to pay for these tax cuts and and the harsh reality is for everybody happy about the tax cuts are predominately the people that are making more income and have saved more [noise]\nAnd the reality is they're going to end up getting stuck paying more if they don't shift in time while the tax sale is in place [noise]\nEnforced goes on to say a having a plan we had a ... a couple of clients this week and said you know what we really like about the in well solution is that you find strategies in solutions that other people miss or we've never heard of\nBut what Forbes goes on to say is not only having a plan but implementing a plan\nBut also making sure it's a holistic plant in other words that plan is obviously a plan that encompasses all things financial taxes inflation market upside without market downside\nWe're seeing a lot of people fully exposed more than even realize they were exposed with a an assessment that shows them the next await hits\nOne client in particular we met with just this last week would lose forty six percent almost fifty cents of every dollar folks and that's assuming it's only as bad as some people are predicting the next crash will be worse than a weight\nThat is not the fear martyr you but it's to wake you up because having a plan and then implementing a plan taking a step further they said the key piece to that third step is then in proving on ... on the original plan in other words finding ways to continue to optimize it so what I Want to encourage you to do\nIs the mindset of having the importance of the investigation\nInto retirement optimization in other words\nHaving the understanding of how all the different puzzle pieces fit together and can synchronize those orchestrate those where you're paying the least legal amount of tax you're protecting the greatest amount of what's going to support your lifestyle income and we've been talking about the the the pyramid problem\nIt'll make the simple you know back in the day when many of us listening our parents or grandparents retired think of a pyramid in sync at the bottom of the pyramid being so you understand think of that being your pensions that our parents and grandparents received\nThat was kind of basis or the foundation of supporting someone throughout their retirement years then there was so security in the consistency of that Social Security and then that little point at the top of the pyramid that was just this supplemental kind of portion of savings that the other two didn't make\nA U.S fully hole that we could count on because at that time banks actually paid interest in people didn't have to take unnecessary stock market risk will now you take that pyramid and flip it upside down and that's where it's what I call them my books the yo yo plan your on\nYour own right no more defined benefits pensions now defined contribution pensions right\nSo at the top where the pyramids no upside down right now we have the need of what we saved to produce the foundation to our retirement then\nWe've got a shrinking Social Security with lower cost of of living adjustments\nEighty five percent of our Social Security can be tax now and of course Social Security being bankrupt and having to make massive cuts here within the next foreseeable future years by around twenty twenty nine many people are predicting at least a Twenty one percent cut before even twenty thirty\nAnd the very bottom right of that pyramid is unfortunately the few people that have the next little to nothing of attention like our parents and grandparents had and folks that's what's creating dilemma so by getting a complete plan a holistic plant plant it incorporates all the different facets\nBy having a plan implementing a plan and then optimizing the planned on an ongoing basis is hidden wealth helping people discover and uncovered they're hidden wealth I'll give you a couple of examples [noise] see a few\nVery many clients are sharing the concerns like a shared last week to be two top boomer concerns so I'm Talking to those of you between the ages of sixty and Seventy five predominantly\nIn predominately those of you that have saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand or more towards retirement folks there's never been a more important time especially being nine and a half years into this Bull Run and noble runs a roommate of ten years folks\nAnd because of this first tax cut some of these articles are saying all that when it is for tax cuts were for corporations to turn around and the tax corporate tax savings turn around and buy their own stock back\nBooks companies have been doing more stock buybacks than into individual investors now for three or four or five years that's what's artificially propped up this marketing folks this market the party can't go on forever\nAnd eventually the party of tax cuts can't go on forever 'cause someone's gonna have to pay for the tax cuts and eventually companies aren't going to be able to continue to buy back as much of their own stock to artificially propped up this market so the two biggest concerns is you can well imagine a very simple the uncertainty of the economy and when the ball runs going to stop and when people are facing\nA downturn that they don't want any more of a downturn and they can stomach because they know they can't stomach one that's going to last them especially if you those are you listening in your sixties\nAnd the the the known of what's predictable of higher taxes having to come to pay for all these tax cuts especially what two point oh tax cut just passing the house [noise]\nI'm a big believer in tax cuts unfortunately what the government's not telling you is where they're going to collect the need attacks from from these tax cuts and it's very simple that's going to come from you in the form of your IRA distributions with a higher tax rate because it's going to push you into a higher tax rate\nEventually as they change the tax rates\nIf especially if they're not made permanent which I think's a long shot and taxing your Social Security taxing more of your Medicare part B indie premiums called penalties\nAnd folks who doesn't have to be that way out to be teaching this Tuesday or I'm going to be teaching introduction of how to grow money without tax used without tax and not leave a tax burden to your kids but also going to teach you to where you can have double digit potential upside\nWhen the market grows without any downside exposure focus has saved our clients bacon in two thousand one to two thousand eight early two thousand nine and it can help you to\nMr Rosenstein decided we couldn't get it until your report came out he sat on for a month of sometime I Can't speak to how they were not the first time Mr Rosenstein is kept us from getting the information\nNeeded information from the project and all kinds of important conversation between struck compete you redacted and promise we had to go with the Justice Department finding this would be the first time he hasn't given us information frankly I think we're in ... I'm going to real well I got thirty seconds I don't have time to get into another subject carrier\nMr I'm which I'm I'm pretty sure that but I Do think it's interesting that you ... you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away like all the other ... ... we had to wait until the final report\nRight now we're to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know poor people that did wrong in the D. O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah quarter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't\nIt and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this any way now James Baker is saying\nAnd Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a cave and that leads to page about the issue so Baker talk to both the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nOr member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs this five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates an already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story ladies' Baron extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here\nEvery day I twenty five now till the top of the hour write down a toll free telephone number it's eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program to big breaking developments as it relates to the biggest abuse of power\nScandal in American history one\nHas to do with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein member he recommended the firing of combing number two he was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth final of Pfizer warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to see color it secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the ... say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker said it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dot CA that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who die by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance how the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and great Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong Greg Jarrett\nYou got out a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composes it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nIn a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had compose this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with this dial aiding investigation to damage Trump and then they violated other federal regulations that say you may never use\nOn verified information to gain a fight so wiretap warrant on an American citizen\nAnd they never had it verified Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal application and he had known new evidence no\nIt ... back to the ... the I I Will take a quick break we'll come back more Greg Jarrett John Solomon and your calls later in the program eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part

all the media elite strategy to destroy Trump before the election\nOh hookers in a bad urinating into an the Ritz and Moscow\nAnd then literally leaking it strategically to get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that fact that's right I mean\nYou cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an account or intelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right there there's a there's a guy that tough to find a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on script guy but his name's bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss she was the chief of counter and travel to accept the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting defy using that information for Christopher ... they had just gotten vetting if there hadn't been and yet the standard for the five is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they ... process and yet they're using it presenting it as a statue to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before a Pfizer port and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like have you back that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOh you know you just defies alone is deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power so-so perjury because they signed off on it or under penalties for perjury it's obstruction of justice\nIs also a conspiracy to defraud the government to fight the court is in existence because\nOf winter we had all these ... applications John that the president said he wanted the class or either non redacted\nWhen are we going to get the war and so what are we going to get the three oh two is we don't we know that Bruce or was working with Christopher Steele Christopher Steele is trying to pass on information about is phony lying ... even Robert Mueller for crying out loud right\nThat's right but the president and you're listening for the Justice Department I mean the guy who said hey there might be some problems here we don't really want you to do this he should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hit from the American public and the court for more than Eighteen months the fact that Hillary Clinton paid for\nThe main evidence used to open an investigation of Trump's campaign [noise]\nWhen I got to leave it right there John Solomon great work well have you on Hannity tonight Greg jar we'll see you on Hannity tonight eight hundred nine four one shown us auto free telephone number a weird twenty eight days away for weeks from today the most important midterm elections one of the big issues\nOn the ballot is health care are going to explain why and what the Republicans ought to be offering as an alternative to Obamacare next\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show don't forget catch the Sean Hannity show weekdays right here on this station and stay to vote more right after the latest news [noise]\nAll right so I've been telling you about my pillow\nHelps me fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer well my friends at my pillow have done it again with their mattress top or now you need to get this because it will literally changed your life in a positive way for ever now is Michael in Dell's exclusive\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I get in a bad accident right\nRight uh you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured life which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable and they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's\nHow you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there\nIn forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise] um and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was er physician run house policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... with able to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know where ... is the phone ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because of the ... shots\nWater we ensuring is using the insurance drives up the cost of the other products so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care I think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee yeah honestly because I pop it\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nA for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it so you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and in a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get Mets cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so something mental stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except one major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions it's\nSomebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nOver the telephone number when we come back wide open telephones and we want to be a part of the program straight ahead you are listening to the best\nOf the Sean Hannity show and stay tuned

a one eight hundred flowers dot com we'll give you another doesn't end up vase absolutely free choice between gorgeous red\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics in ... and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up\nAnd we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democrat Party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the end you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host and a and a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this\nRage or not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out\nI mean new lows in politics Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever ... name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nThe amendment those are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted and released the American people that hasn't happened yet and the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller\nAh why wouldn't they wanna testify Greg Jared under oath\nDoesn't wanna transcribed interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does deceive and the lie with impunity without putting in self in\nLegal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really want to say oh you know Mr good lot let's just you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress he's not looking at\nPerjury because he can always deny the conversations that good ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nOr they've got to do and they shot a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have given but uh I got to let you boats they'll do it right\nGreat job Greg jar congrats on the successor the rush of hoax ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempted sabotage that Donald J Trump that soon to be a best seller thank you Dan mancino appreciate you both being with us when we come back whether bell dot coms job is already well update us next [noise]\nWhen we come back more of the best of the Sean Hannity shows they do [noise]\n\nSo with your back against the wall and her birthday or anniversary just days away who do you trust one eight hundred flowers dot com right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses twenty nine Ninety nine a one eight hundred flowers dot com we'll give you another doesn't end up vase absolutely freed the choice between gorgeous red\nOr multi colored roses is absolutely yours one eight hundred flowers dot com click on the radio icon but in my last name Hannity one eight hundred flowers dot com promo code Hannity this offer ends on friday\nHi Michelle mountains here one of the biggest outrageous I reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes into a clinic comes out of there is\nNo police report and I helped expose crime the mainstream media tried to\n... we had instructions natural course of the movie is amazing Cormac God's know is perhaps the most prolific through American bring friends and family who do not want to be competent it'll change hearts and minds about abortion gazelle rated PG Thirteen\n\nYou\nAre listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show for\nThem out on the show and the answer is no one else does America deserves the truth about Congress\nRule of law is indispensable thriving and vibrant society [noise] she'll citizens from government overreaching\nAnd arbitrary ...\nPursuing truth means always yelling the fact [noise]\nEven if they run counter to our house [noise]\nTruth about credible evidence [laughter]\nStrong opinions\nAbout me a lot of talk about five applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five applications actually a warrant just like a search warrant in order to get five or\nA search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit as true incorrect to the best of his knowledge and belief and that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out the Senate incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed ... David they get a Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal Pfizer application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for\nDodge the aid that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim call me\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nAh as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member\nA and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nWell interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein or not\nBe prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think you're saying is uh\nShaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "14"}
