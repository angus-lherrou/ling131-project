always thought this is new [noise]\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I've worn you over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation he's kept his promise on building the wall isn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduce the bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall you know record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years\nLast time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with\nBroke regimes like Iran and North Korea\nThe sanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are\nThe good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think Nancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either you know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a head of the investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage have all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with the cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in the house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration of Hillary in may\nTwenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAnd exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nOr with a company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the deal Jay or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside\nAnyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that's stunning in terms of\nWhat it reveals since that directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the size of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dusty aid that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton\nFrom the get go which by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials after the OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes she was on with Maria berets aroma I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice we're doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the Pfizer warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without a Hillary's embalming here\nThey wouldn't have been a finds the application to spy on the Trump campaign they wouldn't be fusion GPS or a dusty a on Trump\nWe wouldn't be living through his second year of endless Trump Russia investigation with no evidence whatsoever because Democrats cynically launched the whole thing to ruin Donald Trump's presidency and set 'em up for impeachment\nOn\nHey Sean Hannity show right here on TALK radio Ninety eight point free and he can do you see [noise]\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments\nHave Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get to lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now Judy power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origin nation and for the fifth\nYear in a row they've also rank just highest in the nation for mortgage servicing reached shield another way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin right and what you said in comparison public records ritual approval and balance turned thirty approaches turns actions precaution permission and conditions equal housing Leonard licensing office he said and I'm like thirty thirty additional conditions works loses may apply\nHappier much here they're really why\nShe is a hundred and five pounds of shiny happy dog for life the shedding staff fishing and stuff\nSince two thousand and one we've helped more than a quarter million dogs get over the nutritional deficiency misery and saved our customers billions and vet bills\nEverything we tried to come to dynamite for how you know the I ...\nIf he wants to talk now you got to see the ... the\nFatty I think the guy that are cut out a friend get right down\nKind of fight is Tricia dying to fight for\nYour ... its scratch bank or said like crazy come to China by for help\nEight five nine forty eight one eight five nine four one K.

[laughter]\nThan men are making a wrong turn into logging shouldn't be one of the time they were traffic on TALK radio Ninety eight point three on\nKnow the bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the cabinet issue but the bigger bomb\nThat come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously\nRecord Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment anyway it turns out\nThat not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicle by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe ... and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're in burping me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the\nThing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview\nHe was conveying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one statement says they got along you know fine but no Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\n\nI'm thirty Dave Ramsey later by one on the radio we reacted lazy [noise]\n\nTraining swab or a politician\nThis is Sean Hannity show [noise] twenty\nFive 'til the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land that a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of starting the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane\n... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane and the golf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in the Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean look the average person including me\nHas no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it\nReaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nAnd it's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into pattern in the western Atlantic\nIt's a weakening as far as tropical site clones September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and I said well what does that have to deal with as well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComic to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap on ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw him once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get them ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto we hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting\nIt's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right after the to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia\nUh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nYeah health system remember California already has a state income tax of Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you can no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you could no longer cut or duct rather your state income taxes on your tax return means that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes\nSo the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am is right behind them just ridiculous the amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection\nIt's gonna be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that raised a little more closely and see what happens all the way we do have\nAn attempt by the ... Democrats than out threatening to impeach and continue the investigations into judge Kavanaugh and um they want to now begin the process of teaching them to the house Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler\nWho's a strongly implied impeachment would be on the table of Democrats take over the lower chamber in the midterms\nIs there anybody in the Democratic party that's running on any agenda item that would make\nMake America great for the people in the country or they offering anything to make for better America for anybody Morgan Stanley said the belief in American exceptionalism among global investors has never been higher\nOrgans daily guy by the name of Mr sharp ...

I just read a little bit of the article I didn't finish it yet but I think what he's saying there's a point that I've been making as well except in a different way and that is that if you look at any criticism of Donald Trump it's stylistic stuff\nHome out of style they don't like it is combative they don't like that he breaks dishes they don't like that he fights they don't like that he is at times not polite\nUm they don't like that he is a disruptor ... class they've got their image of how a president needs to behave in an act in what they should say and that they shouldn't be tweeting and this and that\nThe problem with that has to be get rid of that side of Donald Trump you get rid of what we elected the disruption is good breaking dishes in a swamp lake DC is ending up being a good thing for the American people\nThat's why the jobs that are being created the millions of them the manufacturing that's coming back to business environment has never been better\nThe security that we are now obtaining the better trade deals that we are now also locking down it's all good for the American people\nI don't know why people you know there are different people different styles and life\nLike lenders very combative and drops the F bomb a lot on this does not doesn't do it on the program because we have a dump button and when she does we just don't put that true or false absolutely anything nice to say about me today you've been very nice today that everybody except for highly\nOh my God oh ... oh my God oh we're going totally valley girl here go ahead I have nothing to say that I can say on the air\nNo I don't I just said something nice before I said finally you're drinking something that is not disgusting Lee green this is not okay thank you Hillary or orange\nYou make me agree with Hillary when you get an upset with you what is what is it all the coffee that again coffee coffee coffee ...

number three is also the guy that signed the forth find all of ...\nOrange in other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nOn that we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to see color it secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the ... say something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker has set it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe have a pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins ...\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion

was never corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we

documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteenth election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it and affect the application for the Pfizer warrant wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nRight Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was\nHillary Clinton Russian collusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composes it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data\nAs well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nIn a building with Christopher Steele who had composed this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet\nThey ran with this dial aiding investigation to damage Trump and then they violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information to gain a fight so wiretap warrant on an American citizen\nAnd they never had it verified Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal application and he had no new evidence\n... back to the ... I Will take a quick break we'll come back more Greg Jarrett John Solomon and your calls later in the program eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the show right folks you know that the elections are about one thing and as you showing up to us the power\nAnd this election is the most important in decades that's right just twenty nine days away that means your tax savings or on the ballot the economy's on the ballot are comeback is on the ballot your jobs that's on the ballot your kids' future that's on the ballot wages for one case business owners your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest political issue at least one of them\nYou know these bureaucrats in Washington well guess what they want to destroy the progress we've made the last two years I Hope you'll get involved this November go to tax cuts were dot com now tax cuts work\nDot com and by the way to make it easy for you to send emails and tax knock on doors and help the president continues agenda tax cuts work dot com and don't forget you don't show up you get the government you deserve\nTax cuts work dot com do your part don't get out work this November tax cuts work dot com go there now twenty eight days until election day and we will continue\nFinal hour of Sean Hannity\n\nThe clock is ticking every day you put off buying life insurance costs you big time the older you get the more you'll have to pay an is an accident or unexpected illness could caution rates to skyrocket or even make you want to Chernobyl beat the clock\nCall select quote now no hassle no obligation in minutes you'll have a choice of your best raised from up to ten highly rated life insurance companies Richard\nForty years old takes Mets controls cholesterol still select quote kinda my tenure five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month under a dollar a day don't risk your family's security another minute get your frequent now just call\nEight hundred six Seventy forty forty that eight hundred six Seventy forty forty eight hundred six Seventy forty forty more go to select\nCo dot com since Nineteen eighty five we shop you say\nYou're full details on the example of his political to comply commercials are quite clear depending on your health insurance company another factor ...

to destroy Trump before the election\nOh hookers in a bad urinating into an the Ritz and Moscow\nAnd then literally leaking it strategically to get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that fact\nThat's right I mean you cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an account or intelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right there there's a there's a guy that tough to find a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on script guy but his name's bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss she was the chief of counter and travel to accept the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting defy using that information from Christopher ... they had just gotten betting if there hadn't been and yet the standard for the five is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they ... process and yet they're using it presented ... stance jaded verify court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before a Pfizer port and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like have you back that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOh you know you just defies alone is deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power so-so perjury because they signed off on it or under penalties for perjury it's obstruction of justice\nIs also a conspiracy to defraud the government to fight the court is in existence\nBecause of winter we had all these fires applications John that the president said he wanted the class or either the non redacted\nWhen are we going to get the warrants what are we going to get the three oh two is we don't we know that Bruce or was working with Christopher Steele Christopher Steele is trying to pass on information about is phony lying ... even Robert Mueller for crying out loud\nThat's right with the president and you're listening for the Justice Department I met a guy who said hey there might be some problems here we don't really want you to do this he should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hit from the American public and the court for more than Eighteen months the fact that Hillary Clinton paid for the\nEvidence used to open an investigation of Trump's campaign\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer the God Forbid I got in a bad accident right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big thing and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable and they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline then as simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nYour aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or it's an emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model the day of duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... with able to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice health are plus when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create ... ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism or what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nOne ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to get it all rise\nAnd your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so you know I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that you're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock\nGather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nA for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of at the same day and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy just throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's where we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so something mental stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue look these are actually crew insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for ... was empty and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... do you deny them service\nNow everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\n... a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance we can\nLower the cost and in past the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down\nThere right let's take New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um you know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand\nPills I Can't [laughter] and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nWhat about Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nAre exclusive rate shield
