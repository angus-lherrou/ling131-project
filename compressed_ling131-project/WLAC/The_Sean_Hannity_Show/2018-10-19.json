{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Well I think she was talking about Trump [noise] I\nThink Nikki Haley was talking about how could you even has a [noise]\nAny other Democrat coldest and the Democrats call them all the\nTime but I'm not I'm just not used to you know mainstream Republicans calling them out a smart I guess she might have been talking a Cory Booker I don't know\nI I Hope that's the case I Hope she wasn't talking about Trump because she ... other than that one comment she was she was down for Trump to move it was the war and stuff and all that here's a Mike in Tallahassee right to have you with us or how are you\nDoing great rush thanks a lot you bet your question your opening question earlier was on the Democrats think they're going to retake the Congress and I think the answer ... and ... I Believe that the Democratic leadership\nSpokespeople which only a small percentage of the party eight Trump so much so visceral it's wide that them to the fact that most Democrats are apathetic because they have jobs economy doing well\nAnd they have to admit that the president doing a lot of great thing but the leadership of the Democratic party is blinded by there are actually\nWell there's no question about that the Democratic party leadership including in the media are obsessed with their hatred for Trump and so you think\nThey are so the wine doing blindingly enraged by to save them assume everybody else is\nExactly it and they think that's going to produce the voter turnout that they did in ... during the presidential election that would change the leadership of the house [laughter]\nWhat yeah okay you're kind of on my same page here I'm you know I'm looking at what has changed it's going to reverse the fortunes of the Democrats who've been losing elections who have not been turning out voters\nIt isn't issue related because they're not proposing proposing any and they're certainly not advocating and they all they're doing is ripping the bullying and so\nSo your theory is that they are fooling themselves that they're they think they've got this massive hate Trump movement out there that they've created that's going to show up in droves and sweep Republicans out of office\nAnd most Democrats are admitting that the economy's doing well and they may not like the president techniques but they have to admit that\nWhy now wait a minute wait a minute what most Democrats where are you seeing most Democrats big grudgingly admit that the economy's doing well\nI unfortunately my entire family democratic that pre med I socialize took Democrat because they're nice people\nOkay but they are you are concluding then that that there's not just your your like your family that that has been grudgingly admitting things are getting better they do not blindly hate Trump\nDon't they don't widely eight Trump and don't feel like they go it's going to matter\nWhat so you're telling me they're not all that exciting to show up and vote exactly [noise] so now you're you're calling from Tallahassee what are your what is your family's thoughts on Andrew Gillum\nI'm dangerous [noise] in a good way of bad was\nIt not I'm not sure that dangerous can ever be good but it ... well\nI'm the most dangerous man in America because it's good though I ended up at work and you can be good dangerous on\nAndrew Gillum is a democratic candidate for governor here he's up against run the Santa and I'm the guy the guy is a is it dangerous is the right word but your family mostly Democrats are not into the guy is that what you're saying well\nMost of my family in the mid west [noise]\nWhat about Democrats said you know for the Democrats and they're really nice people do\nYeah they are and and none of them support ill because they watched it back as mayor of happy it when you ask them a bottom they looked at their shoes shake their at\nAll right so this is it's look all of this is ... by the way the word is a and\nE.

L. ethnic total some people think it's anti does all\nThat would be against adults all and there's no such thing as against ... there's no pro does all there is no ... do do business and neck don't all and it just means it's unscientific here say it's you know a person talking to four or five others and it's really dangerous to projecting\nYou talked to four or five Democrats so think Trump's okay man not the best guy with the economy is going great I I don't think I'm going to vote you can't take out those poor people and make its scientific that the Democrats are going to have a turnout problem even though that's what Mike is as postulated hearsay hit his point is\nThat the Democrat leadership and the media leadership is really kind of alone they are enraged they are blinded by their hatred\nSo much so that they think everybody liked them\nHates Trump and this is going to drive Democrats back to the polls more than anything has since Obama in two thousand eight\n[noise] and it's the old it's the old negative there is such a thing as negative turnout but it's not meant as it's been a negative turnout is your turn out\nTo oppose some thing that you are Michael e wary of or afraid of a\nThe kind of negative turnout we're talking about here is Democrats turning out in droves be cause they\nUm despise Trump and and so forth and he's just saying he doesn't think that exists all across and threw out the Democrat Party we will see time will tell in not too long [noise] celebrating\nThe American way more\nI mean we're Sean Hannity back to name right after rush [noise]\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well may take cigars for example the details are what matter same goes for simply say home security\nTheir attention to detail and craftsmanship makes simply say system truly different from everything else out there it's easy to set up and it's easy to use and it works in about a power outages are downed wires 'cause there aren't any of those\nAnd there are no contracts get ten percent off simply say usa dot com that's simply safe usa dot com\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in privileges helps your brain\nAnd actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jelly fish in clinical trials president has been shown to improve short term memory ... healthier brain better\nNow available in stores everywhere things up and evaluate anybody of this product is not intended to treat you prevent any disease\nQuicker weaken up\nAnother debate in London on TALK radio not eat going for them [noise]\nAnd so the the ratings are in for cable news last night I don't really folks like to make a big deal with these because we live on Iran and should die by on and we have readings insurance but it was it was a really good night [noise]\nFor the call an enemy show Fox News in general the bay though that oh what a better or worse town hall\nDidn't even rate as much CNN usually gets it was\nA bomb that did I say that was certainly nothing to ride your mom about and\nMaggie Haberman New York times thinks that Trump is behind the caravan from Honduras the Trump if\nI don't foresee on Monday had a good weekend [noise]\nPretty unbelievable story and oh and fake news CNN he's they fail to even call him out for lying about fleeing the scene of an accident while he was wasted\nYou know and or his legalizing narcotics view there was a genius for you\nUnbelievers he will be Chuck Schumer is it was it an article written I don't know where I saw it\nUm I don't know who this person is Heather Wilhelm\nThe ... the embarrassment the embarrassing spectacle of paid oh mania do you know they've spent nearly Seventy million dollars outside of the Texas money to unseat Ted Cruz it's unbelievable so I'm proud of them I'm going to be in Houston tomorrow\nWe're going to be following this story it's got to be a town hall I get to participate by the way which was nice\nAnd a Rick Perry is going to be there on behalf of Ted and I'm going to be interviewing both of them and uh it's gonna be in Houston all the details are on Hannity dot com I Hope that our friends Katie are Rachel hope that they didn't come on out we'd love to see out there\nIt's going to be at the double tree greenway plaza\nGoing to be eleven AM greenway plaza Houston, Texas and we're going to be in Beaumont town hall there three thirty Edison plaza all details on Hannity dot com and excited to be there\nYou know but this one thing is true about this headline is it is an embarrassing spectacle you know and the ... I'm telling you I Am the people are Texans are not going to put up with this\nI Know the people of Texas they're not you know what I think they start early voting on Monday in Texas um so that's coming to to ahead I mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the winds me of Obama in the sense that he's cool oh beta O'Rourke\nIt's it it is they out side Texas phenomenon not attack it only by the way this is the New York the the thing is that the San Francisco LA thing he gets a full hour\nOn fake news CNN he can't even gone to a million viewers that's the that's not just taxes that's the whole country you know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV he could've done a Facebook wife short Twitter live show and done better than a million\n[noise] anyway so you know then you know Texas by the way we have some examples there of people asking non citizens to register to vote that's down becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock is a rock star you can be the twenty twenty nominee\nOr you try and get through Ted Cruz ... good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America\nI Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen but four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels\nYou can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using in this I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map\nOut where the border patrol where agents orange so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed\nIn bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities that's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful\nNow the president well he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done\nThat in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and any sense of constitutional\nOr authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex Rick Scott has killed himself and don't such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I'm maybe the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of\nA lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just they're lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that's why project very tossed catching Brett ascent on tape and his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not going to support cabinet he's not going to\nBe but [laughter]\nI Can't believe that he would actually go yeah [laughter]\nWe're still\nI don't see much smaller like\n[laughter]\n[laughter] right um [laughter]\nThe people at Tennessee or ignorant according to the campaign of Phil Bredesen and they're just doing saying what they need to say the get elected to just pick up all the same thing Claire McCaskill's exposed doing the same exact thing\nAnd then you think she's more progressive than she left on the game or a at least you know in my mind\nSo she has a lot more or less what might those there's a lot\nMore radical than what she says\nOh there's a story that just broken Claire McCaskill is going to be problematic because see it on Fox News dot com and the headline is her husband is accused of abuse by his ex wife\nAnyway was reportedly accused of domestic violence and\nMissouri candidates a Claire McCaskill has been accused of domestic violence and as one company wants to victim blamed a woman who sued for sexual misconduct\nOh I Wonder if she's going

obviously CNN as they made their decision or they're supporting which is pretty fast that any anyway we just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Brett ascend has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people at Tennessee\nThe same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christian cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a sign that join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha make Sally\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you say that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott is always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi once she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a so that so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana now West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had it with him and you know now his association with this Chilean Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug so where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America stands in St John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because of his eight operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective is the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a\nNationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and\nWhen the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen so if you can get\nTo sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired particularly\nOn Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after
