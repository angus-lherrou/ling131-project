I Hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but\nNow have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing\nAnd I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee she'd been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television and we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races and an attempt to help them all out\nOh no I'm I honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the the pure force the personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class but I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made it was trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime from ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that\nYou know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great with therapy for the world you know you got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nYou know on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today in an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to

fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the ... he can start again [noise] but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and for that strength [noise] and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nAnd the president really demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil you gotta be kidding when you when they go low you just kick them\nOn Michelle Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want him to be afraid to their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything when\nSarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist moms and they are moms\nAnd this this is Rand Paul point out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allow this to continue bought the rhetoric is coming from the ... so called leadership\nAnd by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nMe to go out and get your friends your neighbors your the weather or whether they can watch them and I'm not as a foot miss a purchase on Fox News\nAlso is a bird is up against the Sean Hannity\nWhen someone is cruel or like a bully you don't just to their level now our motto is\nWhen they go low we go

were thrown against this man and people still I Believe I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that as an pain\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we see it every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you know follow them in the gas stations and grocery stores\nYou cannot be demo with a

Obama national security adviser Susan Rice or her son happens to be a conservative\nIn fact his name is John rice camera and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and is now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that rice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nOther student news outlets citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest\nAt rice Cameron's request and issued a citation for battery\nAt the Stanford Daily quoted a law enforcement source saying there's no obvious physical injury to either party involved and rice camera refused evaluation by paramedics Hernandez along with multiple other witnesses dispute that characterization and claim Hernandez merely touched\nHim after he refused to stop\nVideo recording a her without her consent I don't know if you saw the recent video my friend and colleague Brian kill me to the Fox news channel Ryan's walking the streets of New York and these guys did they just would not let up Bryan goes on the subway there in the summer they go\nIf you want to say something about somebody that's best friends with Donald Trump saying now\nI mean it's unbelievable\nAnd what are you supposed to do with that you can't react you can't say anything but if they're creating you talk about what do we what ... what are the liberals always a hostile environment\nThey're creating a pretty hostile mob like environment in some cases we showed the video what went on in Portland where literally people driving their cars are being stopped their cars being kicked God Forbid if you had to make a\nAmerica great bumper sticker on your car or or wearing a make America great hat God help you in that particular case it doesn't and all of this was being encouraged\nBy the so called leaders of the Democratic party and that's what you that's all we got to understand here\nThis is the modern left the Democratic party there is no vision there's no there's there are no solutions being offered there's a lot of hate being pedaled around\nA lot of innuendos now we know they're not the party of the constitution and due process and presumption of innocence you know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unsavory people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you don't know where these people are [laughter] well we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational people my back down\nWhat's gonna happen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally or comes with a knife to a rally there is going to evade assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nYeah they need to calm the rhetoric town but it's not like what are they going to do they're going to go out there and say well we're running on raising your taxes were running an open borders and eliminating ice\nWe're running but as we want to impeach the president we've tried for two years to undermine this man we've had the power of the deep state at levels that well nobody ever thought

people but I understand they're wrapped their arms around the fact that how is it possible that you know communism fascism in in this case that he was writing about not the ...\nIn the last century a

TALK radio not only three\nW. L. A.\nWhy does it get so wryly read a book\nOut is killing the S. as Amazon dot com bookstores everywhere and Hannity dot com let me just go back if I may to your book because I was really impressed I couldn't put this book down a Bill O'Reilly is with us the book is called killing the ss\nMen I kind of consider myself a World War two history buffs in a in a sense my dad fought in World War two and what I liked it I learned from the book was post World war two after the fall of the third Reich and and then you had British\nAmerican all these intelligence forces working together to apprehend the likes of Adolf Eichmann and Joseph ... and all these other you know brutal thugs evil murderers and uh and that whole search was a pretty fascinating thing and it went on for years\nYou know we got a after Iraq killing Jesus we had a foreign Martin new garden I I'm a nice relationship with the Israeli government and we went back to them for killing the assassin they opened up some of their massage files and nobody had ever seen before um and we got information about the track down\nOf a man and a mango law and Klaus Barbie that nobody else has ever seen they have been secret all these years did you know that ... to butcher of early on in France\nHeaded the Bolivian Secret Service and that's actually a secret police and he was responsible for tracking down and murdering shade war\nVohra unbelievable Castro's\nRight hand man those are the kinds of things that are all over killing the ss so if people are interested in history they're interested in in this Holocaust which every American and the younger people don't know anything about it so by this book read it and then slap it into the hands of some twenty two year old\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah I got to tell you one thing because there's something happening in history we have a moment\nTo thread the needle like we've never had before and out of here of rainy and had Gemini we have an unprecedented alliance that is emerging the United states Israel our closest closest ally in the middle east the Jordanians the Egyptians the Saudis are putting aside the issues with Saudi Arabia today\nAnd the Emirates and they're all uniting sharing intelligence\nAnd recognizing the evil that is the uranium mullahs chanting death to Israel death to America and fomenting terror the number one state sponsor of terror but meant for mending proxy wars all around the region\nAnd this might be the opportunity to create that piece in the middle East that has been a base of war ever I that's what I see is a potential possibility\nIf there is a possibility there that the Iranian people themselves the Persians will um have had enough and that will take out the mothers who are persecuting not only them but anybody else that they don't like\nUm the mall is no different than a Third Reich I mean the revolutionary guard in Iran at this moment it's no different than the ... it's the same mentality will kill you and we don't care you're infidels\nAnd we they want children to die and if you don't increase Medicare more than seven percent every year you want to throw grandma were close so I don't want to get lectures from anybody you know well now we see people you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz\nMcConnell a you know I guess the the angry mob now getting into people's faces like they've been told to do by Maxine Waters Cory Booker and others and I think Rand Paul's right that um this is not going to end well somebody who's going to get hurt or killed in the process\nA Danielle and it's one big lie that they go high because the Democrats have never gone high they've always gone low\nGrade\nAt nothing casual hat to him and I agree with you watch it that we're seeing an escalation of rhetoric which ...\nI Want to say about what it is this one quite fasting caught it in a case he got to say I mean if\nWe can anything and if we don't have anything to fight and is that they can and the fact that people are surprised I think that's how that's on the wealth station genetically\nAnd so I think maybe I should look into that hang around and say how\nAre we going to get a new line but it's never been the case Jonathan I mean that's why we chronicled the separate two and four years and I think we saw the worst of the worst with judge Kavanaugh you know immediately I Believe\nI think people that make serious allegations like was made in the case of professor port they've got to be listened to but she gave the names of people including an eye witness that didn't corroborate their story\nYeah you know the the problem we're we're having now Sean is that we don't just have the the same rhetoric that politics have every year we also have activists out there we have um\nDifferent groups like ... and uh by all means necessary be am in in ... these people are actively going out and causing fear and intimidation using violence as we saw in Portland, Oregon when you combine all these things\nThe the rhetoric the violence\nThe on the ground in your face type of stuff is there going and intimidating the politicians and uh then speakers when they're out eating what you're seeing is an escalation far beyond just rhetoric which we've had before and even when you have somebody like Dr Ford given testimony it gets mass\nGets covered up whether it's serious or real there's evidence or not this stuff gets so covered up by a motion\nUm and that it's gotten completely out of control now to a point where uh there there is no truth I mean you look at these\nStatements that Eric Holder made you can't double speak you can't say kick people and then say let's not do anything illegal that's double speak\nBut then you know this has been your party name one thing that does your Democratic Party you're below party is offering the American people besides impeachment endless investigations keeping the failure of Obamacare wanting the crumbs back of the tax cut open borders eliminating ice what what what are they going to do for the\nMen and women in this country\nUm after eight years of failure with rock Obama what are they gonna what are they offering what are they running on except hatred\nDifferent again I I Can't Craig's list and conditions Medicare and Medicaid Medicare that environment at they don't want to\nAsk what are they gonna do they had eight years uh Brock Hussein Obama as president\nThirteen million more Americans on and on food stamps have more in poverty accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined the lowest labor participation rate since the Nineteen seventies and the only president in history never to reach a ... percent GDP GDP Growth than a year\nYou know they had that they had the football they they they ran backwards the country went backwards now we got eight million Americans out of poverty for a million of food stamps for a million jobs manufacturing jobs over almost five hundred thousand of those those are jobs Obama set of never coming back\nWhy should anybody vote Democrat 'cause all we hear is as lies negativity et cetera et cetera\nNot George W flushed and here at\nHome I got from talking about\nWhat what what are they are offering hit they forget about George Bush beat that ... that's a century ago what are they\nOffering people now and how they change from the Obama years what did they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nWell like I said we had we care about in any case we care that\nI we got a bad line again I haven't been to China than what is it\nYou know somebody who's had a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter is the fact that we're here and now\nAnd there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that but we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college change the number of Supreme Court justices ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that doesn't even believe in simple due process the constitution presumption of innocence how you know how how do you become a party that has now noted for\nYou you know people in your party confronting people and in restaurants women Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders you can't you can't even go have a bite to eat without being confronted now\nYou know the list that you've been doing over the past year about all this stuff to have to do with the Russia investigation all that if you did a list on your show of all the things that the Democrat Party is trying to do to get away from the way we live the constitution due process all these things\nI think people would be shocked at how much they are trying to get us away from the founding fathers instilled into the constitution it's shocking\nHow how do you run on the idea that I Want you know the tax cuts the largest in history putting a thousand two thousand dollars and and the average family's pocket in this country that's real money for real families\nThe first pay raise they've had since like Nineteen Ninety in terms of real dollars and ... they call it oh those are just crumbs but they want the crumbs pack yeah I mean how do you want the crowd is about how many more Americans\nAre going to lose their doctors their plans and pay you know a hundred percent more yeah and and that's over the course of a year in some cases\nFor health care who wants to open borders I've been down to the board I've been in the drug warehouses you work your life and law enforcement um why not just build a wall protect our borders put a big door in but we just got a check you out make sure you want to be a part of our family you're not here to do any damage\nYou know I I just got back from Ireland that went over to Ireland a four four and a half there was just there for four and a half days I've never been to Europe before I come back and when I saw where there is the same thing is happening over here uh\nPeople are being neutralize they're being they want to take away their identity they want to take away their individuality they want to get rid of borders they want to or they want to integrate all these different cultures from all these other countries with no excuses and what ... what happens\nWhen you do that people fall into Iran and they're easily can we're a\nConstitutional republic right you know it's for example surreal law as ... as the glaring example somebody grows up with values that are the exact\nOpposite of what we cherish the early in this country you know where women are you know third class citizens can't ... can't drive in some cases a spousal rape is not even a crime and some of these countries gays and lesbians or killed for being who they are in some of these countries you\nCan practice Judaism Christianity in these countries I you know I don't understand it\nYou know we have to know that you want to adopt our values I think that's fair I got to take a quick break we'll come back more with Jonathan Gillum and Danielle McLaughlin on the other side of the break also gender die a bill is going to stop by a I Want to give everybody a heads up you've probably heard by now hackers exploiting\nA security vulnerability of Facebook potentially exposing the personal information\nNearly fifty million accounts now attacker stole what is called accessed tokens which they could use to take over people's accounts at least tokens or like digital keys that he people logged in so then they don't need to re enter their password every time\nBankruptcy we offer a guarantee with no upfront fees so there's no risk\nFor the free information you need a call now one eight hundred two hundred seven four zero to that one eight hundred two hundred seven\nFour zero to one eight hundred\nTwo hundred seven four zero to\nMaking a wrong turn into gridlock shouldn't be one of them die and traffic on TALK radio Ninety eight point three on the van doubled you want to be quite as we continue with Daniel\nMcLaughlin and our good friend Jonathan Gillum you know the Daniel I go back what what are the big ideas\nThat you have as a Democrat what are you running on it's gonna make this a better place\nI agree with you on the immigration thing as an immigrant and you can hear you talk to values Europe right in this country is ... and so on and on that and as it relates to get in it and it's like Medicaid and fake\nLike what ... what what are you on a porch illustrated liberal when it in the Ninety Obama greeted was at one of those Obama phones for free [laughter]\nI think the Obama folks were actually real iPhone ... through a megaphone from a quarter million irritating this is that you can't get a decent online is what happens Democrats don't pay their bills and they didn't pay Daniel Robison you didn't pay ... bucks right you want the government to pay for your phone you whenever the child care health care you know ... what are we going to have\nDriving services doesn't have a car and she lives in New York state will fill a gas tank while you get a piece of the phone I don't understand that\nYou find any one show on a\nHorse liberal on some of them for free of course not yet a last name that's it that's off by your phone if you promise to bust up this football followed them break it on the air it's ridiculous\nHow many more phone calls do we have to make video I mean All right I'm going to wait I'll see you next week I think that's maybe a good idea to show up and up because the phone thing isn't working out too well actually right now it sounds pretty good to maybe she can give us some final hug or a final thoughts go is ...\n... ... and you know I Love disagree all the time I Do think immigrants need to fight for something\nAnd they're not getting something twenty six days they're not admit it\n[laughter] I I'm not going to agree with that sorry [laughter]\nAnd what are they fighting for health care health care keeping Obamacare jobs from putting Trump is the one that got the jobs we didn't have any jobs under Obama\nHe brought us down he took it from the ...\nOh okay but he put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in\nPoverty and the years in the ... okay yeah eight years to fix that meant Trump is done over the years that's the point oh half\nThat kind of plan that he had Hispanic kind of planet\nRight anyway last word or good ... you know nothing going\nYou know showing you been doing this for a long time over Thirty years he's been doing that and I've\nNever heard a worst phone then [laughter] and then you'll McLaughlin\nAnd in in that then those Thirty years you see I wash interviews where people are they're asking young people if they're going to vote in they're going to say there say no because they're not really ended if you have been in the middle of his wife was out doing law enforcement you weren't integrated into all this politics have you yourself\nEver seen ... at the Democratic party ever leave any sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was an office of the Democratic\nWay they would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think for the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move towards the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one of the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton signed it and it worked but it was more at a political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism\nIs a failed law the ideology that never works\nIt seems great on paper free health care free ... did they care free free free you know do\nWe got this guy running out Doug avenue ... California three everything for everybody whether you're a citizen and non citizen free health care for anybody in California you don't even have to be a resident of taxpayer California Frank okay

goes to me what do I listen\nThis is this is really important this topic and your listeners are going to love this because\nA lot of us are buried in technology right now we're on a cell phone a lot on social media a lot it's too much time I had an addiction to technology I was I went for each one of those people who was fully engaged in real life moments great conversation face to face time\nTo someone who was staring at you know there's a ton of trolls on social media is not good for your health staring at that falling losing my mind and I started to sit back and say is this good for me what can I Do still have a presence in the spaces\nAre the way it is not negatively affect my life\nI Want to pay a picture for my audience I have three television sets on a above the bought my online I have five not one not two five computers in front of me three with different websites one with a an email and one was a call screener on it\nAnd I have not one but two phones which I change basically every other week\nOkay so you need to read this book cover to cover because what was what ... what I can see what's happening at people and this is a particularly important book for her parents for teachers\nFor people who are grandparents for anyone who is working with us surrounded by kids and sees that kids now when they're buried in these phone they are losing so many important skills that we had you\nMay be surrounded by technology right now Sean but you have the benefit of growing up at a time when your formative here you had to learn how to have conversations face to face when you know I was thinking about my middle school there the other day you know that boy had to get\nThe courage up to walk across that the ... face to face asked me if I Want it to dance that bill
