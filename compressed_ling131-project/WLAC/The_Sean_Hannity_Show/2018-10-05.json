tomorrow I Begin my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\nAnd my Thirty years on radio that was one of the most thoughtful speeches I think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm\nSusan Collins over the years is frustrated the living daylights out of me were opinion so I think what stands out more than\nAnything else is the the since here come the amount of gravity that she gave to her decision and her speech\nAnd the gravity of the moment and and as an bringing literally a sense of sanity\nTo what has become an absolute so she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from judge Kavanaugh his judicial temperament the questions that he specifically answered her passion about\nUh especially didn't I disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice\nAnd consent and the respect that she is showing the constitution the process\nAnd the whole process of a role of what it means to give advice and consent\nNow with Susan Collins yes and Jeff Flake saying he is a yes on camera and all that now brings us to well Lisa Murkowski stimulate use ... know

is the pressure under which Susan Collins has been\nThere is literally a main going on now and by the way Maine is not exactly one of the most expensive media markets but she talked in the beginning\nAt length about the process and what this has now become a and talk about it being a a gutter political campaign and millions of dollars and people in groups of people pledging to destroy

based on facts\nAnd the standards that she uses to evaluate important issues maybe that's why she kept it to herself pretty much the whole time nobody knew what she was going to do that was just not a a non partisan speech\nIt was a speech in a row of mind or of\nThe dignity that we can have them in spite of big disagreements and talked about the law the constitution the role of the Senate advice and consent and a little bit of class\nAnd she made all of these left wing or is that have been saying all these days and it's going to get worse\nUnless we insist that stop and thirty two days

single person that has contacted her\nTo say I was that the\nParty that now further more than her pets have testified that also she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that he has to get ten she went if needed or fried\nYet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the ones\nWho drove her home or where in the car with her that night and professor Ford also

she okay not even close to his friend ... ...\nMy ... tall\nIs that Brett Kavanaugh will work\nLess than that ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer fight for justice and\nAnd so that the public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is three doors [noise] Mr ...\nI Will check for ...\n\nAnd with that Susan Collins announcing I think one of the well I'm going to be honest I thought it was the most powerful speech\nIn recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen it was Thoreau it was sober it was smart it was bought full it was comprehensive she went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system\nHow she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I I'm frankly we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that for you to our beloved audience because it was something that I wanted\nEverybody to hear this is a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country\nYou cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence the way judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWe're really realize today is I don't know her well she doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness\nThe intellect the the systematic she walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was obvious\nShe missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this\nProcess did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they've been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and\nYou'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\nI I found somebody today that I had\nNo idea that the federal ... under which she makes her decisions and I I ... back time I respect I ... I really have a deep respect I Want everybody to have their own mind I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I hold passionate dear\nBut you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside in the halls in the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting\nAnd Maine is not exactly an a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and\nInfluence or in groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office and destroying her\nAnd I'm like that anybody listen to what senator call just said\nThat anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most\nThorough case for for how any\nSenator or congressman should make a decision\nAgain a good example for a civics class to look at it in terms of the way I senator should act but let's talk about the politics for a moment [noise] okay I talk a lot about ... only because I've tried to save the system\nTo be on those votes but but but you know you more than made up for it\n... I don't think I had anything to make up for I really ... for you to disagree with me I'm not going to run my life around being somebody\nFor I'm not going to end my life around what the hell Hannity things no way or another to\nBe honest with you I'm going to be true to me aren't you Trudy\nYesterday on Leno wouldn't expect anything that\nSusan Collins she's a moderate pro choice Republican from New England\nThat represents a party a that used to exist in New England and greater numbers\nShe is a fiscal conservative she voted for the tax bill\nShe's a social moderate and she will do things you won't like in the future but whatever she does will be thought out and reasons but here's why I appreciate you talking about Susan Collins today she has come as close to anybody in my lifetime of saving the republic\nFrom the abyss because we're headed down where nobody would want to be a judge in the future if Susan had legitimize this God help the Senate confirmation\nPrior to ... ... she's she said it it's been a rapid decline for Thirty years they've cut it but I've got a new senator\nUm okay I don't think this would have happened I don't think I don't\nThink we should say that but I I Will do something without electricity ... just just for a second okay I'm going to send me on every year now the politician do probably\nUh I'm fine uh you know I'm fine uh if you can help Susan helps as they are going to try to destroy her now she comes from a purple state\nA President Trump last name but a few points he wanted a second congressional district the main politics are different than they are in South Carolina and she was not about main herself she was about America\nShe represents the best of Margaret Chase Smith a a history of of Maine and if you really\nDon't be fooled she's a moderate she's not a Sean Hannity conservative she's a moderate but she loves the country and she's got more guts and most politicians and her little finger than most everybody I Know in my district she's not afraid so helper Sean till you're ... years to help her they're killing our financial\nSenator helper I I was so blown away by that speech I Would absolutely recommend that people help her she she did something because\nShe is level the playing field them brought a voice of sanity well thought out intellectual constitutional sanity that stood on core principles a presumption of innocence was beyond the ... to me\nLet me let me ask you this um tell us about management mentioned say yes to\nWell mansions ESL light Joe and um you know he was a yes\nBut Susan was the center of the storm and I'll say something about like we've had our differences I Know the president said their differences but Jeff Flake also is that yes Jeff Flake or is on the other side of a lot of things with Trump but he rose to the occasion and say listen\nI Want to hear more but I'm inclined to believe what I Believe\nI Want to hear from Dr Ford he listened to you also listen to ... and the process her and Susan and Susan ... is gonna make Kevin a better nominee more legitimate nominee so I Want to thank him too but in the end of the day this is about\nA person a single person\nWho is sort of the odd person out in politics\nRising to the ... and being that giant and to the extent I did my part thank you a warning to stand up for a good man 'cause I've known him for Twenty years uh I wanted to let everybody in the country now have despicable in my eyes he was being treated and that they are had\nSenator China's moment in all the way I was actually on your good good and I don't know yet

hearts and minds about abortion\nGot rabid PG Thirteen your brain isn't it\nThat's done so much in so little time to use no administration is coming from\nAnd what we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest in Nineteen sixty nine four hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama set a never coming back\nBy the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector\nOnce they can get up and online and an Warren and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal mining industry in West Virginia singlehandedly\nAnd

trouble in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down and eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... been surging lately ah where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabin offset but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge whether Trump voters are showing you know your dog and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday a those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey act it's got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked at ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours\nEntering states that that Donald Trump won\nWhat can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay on because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it and they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for super back\nShe's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's\nIt's not a big explosion but what it is is ...\n... is coming back in and\nGalileo while ... Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison\nA I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but al ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs that I'm going to lead in the house which right there you can lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job and then\nYou are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats them from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York the the San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with my writing of America I think it's very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going on inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... and sixteen days\n[noise] let let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did to the man who support you\nWere sitting on the disgusting and nobody who lie to you Eric poor experimenting Arlen and things like\nThat do you what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process\nAnd for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly they looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably have the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I Would have a I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal philosophical differences\nWith a judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voting for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and the Democrat second um I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of our judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and there's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party\nUm I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug does makes the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Democrats put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving\nBut they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape that women are people\nPeople weren't right through it and realized it was a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump and and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we have to keep them engaged over the next four weeks because when we when again and cabinet gets confirmed they can think oh things are fine now\nCase Sean Hannity show right here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three in the hands W.
