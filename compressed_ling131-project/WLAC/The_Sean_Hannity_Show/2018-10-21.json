{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Hey we've been talking about the boomers two biggest success techniques that we have found that ultimately I've learned from the flow into\nThe highly paid politicians to high income earners all the way to Big Ten football coaches that were just discussed in the ah the media this last week about putting two million into a strategy that has upside with no downside\nSo you have like Flora protection and which is what we call indexing but you money only participate when the market goes up\nAt double digit potential returns but does not participate when the market goes down and folks this has been part of our family's financial foundation now for well over Twenty years because I'm somebody likely like many of you listening that knows what it feels like to lose money and in light of what's happened just this last week\nWhere many people took a three percent tumble just in one day this last mid week day the fourth largest single point drop in our stock market history just transpired this last week\nAnd as the headlines read which I again this isn't a fear tactic this is just to educate people CNBC reporter this last week there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts are watching the charts\nCNBC also said they're warning signs of a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go Amazon and ... a Facebook plummeted stocks a tech stocks recorded their worst day in seven years this past Wednesday and the folks the list goes on and on and on\nAnd it it's not good news because again what what's the reality here let's review the facts were nine and a half years into the longest Bull Run in stock market history\nRight no bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday\nIn the last time right that the second longest bull market being fueled by the dot com boom and then unfortunately the rally went bust in the nineties caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent folks I'm One of them\nI'm somebody that I'm going to teach you indexing versus investing that anchor down our families ... financial foundation and praise the lord we had that but at the same time I got greedy as Warren Buffett talks about I did the opposite I he says be greedy when others are fearful that be fearful when others are greedy\nAnd I took too much risk and it it prompted all\nThose years ago are experiencing the loss of some of our families money into studying what the flu and the ultra wealthy have done for years and this is an interesting statistic that many people that I've had the opportunity to educate I'm not just a best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that\nHas written several books a two time best selling author and it all came from the things that I've learned from other people\nAnd then by applying these techniques and showing people how these techniques can work in conjunction with one another enables folks to discovered uncover their various areas of hidden wealth\nThat typically reside in the two biggest threats to boomers which ended up being the two biggest success techniques and that is eliminating stock market crashes\nAnd eliminating unnecessary taxes\nSo getting rid of the crashes and taxes folks is not that difficult in other words having a stock market protection plan any unnecessary not to pay tax savings plan and it's all done through using the tax code right judge hands several years ago said there's two types of of of taxes\nAre in this country tax payers I should say that he says there in this country the informed and the uninformed right however both are legal focus is not deceptive tax evasion this this strategic tax avoidance it's teaching people\nHow to grow money without tax access their money without tax and transfer without tax that's a savings in itself\nBut protecting yourself from this market volatility that I Believe is back right to lose eight hundred and thirty two points in one day this past week being the fourth largest single point drop in our stock markets history\nIs giving people the riding on the wall with many people predicting this happening well before now I myself have been teaching people how to get ... they're serious retirement savings anger down and secured\nTo not not just a lot lose but folks it's called lock in and reset so let me spending just a minute on this for you because this may be one of the biggest breakthroughs the boomers have shared\nThat I'll be teaching this coming Tuesday or more specifically that I Want you to be able to learn more about right people don't have is one clients that ... we don't have time\nTo go through another major market meltdown we we do not have the time to recover\nAnd of course folks that's the big concern dry but many people are caught off guard by these unnecessary taxes [noise]\nLet me teach you just a couple of quick techniques then I'll be teaching more about an in depth and detail this coming Tuesday lock in reset it's a unique provision in the engineering of how to to to structure your savings\nThat you're going to build a structured cash flow of of secure retirement income from so that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nIn the strategy is very simple as the market goes up your money isn't in the daily ups and downs and all around the stock market right especially with all this volatility but ironically the volatility itself actually makes this strategy better\nNow I Know that sounds kind of odd or counterintuitive so how can volatility helped me Chuck let's let's think about this\nWhen when the market has again our clients lock in that game never risk of giving that game back\nIs not what anybody else has I can assure you [laughter] I I I personally sit with clients on a weekly basis and and I can't believe nor can they the exposure that they start to realize they have by some of our software analysis [noise] one just the other day with would lose fifty five percent of another oh wait market crash hits [noise]\nAnd they can't afford that has no one could it but if the same time when there's again\nIt's locked in huge peace of mind sleeping better no worry right and when the market does lose there's the floor of protection\nSo if they lock in but here's the key the reset\nSo if the S. and P. today let's say sell a thousand points\nAre clients don't lose they lock in any prior games not at risk of giving them back and then they get the advantage of the index that they're tracking only games not losses to Theresa sad at the lowest point\nTo start their next game right so in other words if the S. and P. loses a thousand points the folks have to wait for that thousand points to be made back before they start any new game our clients start their new gain from the lowest level forward\nFolks that is huge that's a way to out Fox Wall Street and how we've been getting that done and helping clients secure they're serious retirement savings\nFor over two decades now here's the things I I Want to teach you this coming Tuesday so for those that have saved at least\nTwo hundred thousand or more are typically between the ages of forty five and Seventy five I don't care if you're getting to retirement or you're getting through retirement you can improve you can increase this isn't about playing it safe\nThis is about playing it strategically and this has outperformed the market this has outperformed the unnecessary taxes and it's helped people do a few things number one avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax to\nA number to avoiding having their retirement income tax\nA number three avoiding leaving a unnecessary inheritance tax to your kids or your grandkids and ultimately giving people the ability to live more and ironically leave more all without\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe at talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nIt was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interesting leave funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller of the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova up to ... with us a thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to earn force that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\n... the name that people need to also militarized themselves with is Marco why it marked why it was ... he was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or in Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nIt's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you were talking to your former friends and telling them to get a get hit in to the Congress to take this ad and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh minds you didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about seeing as you said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it there\nBut I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... of warrants the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss that Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an issue any subpoenas for we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without\nFor example Carter Page said discovery in a case that Carter Page could bring would open up all kinds of information about what what\nHow long would that discovery take 'cause I Know Carter Page is moving forward with a lawsuit\n[noise] well it it just depends on the judge ... where you where you're filed the case are there it's a slow docket or rocket rocket docket but none of this could've been done Sean without the ... puts it to cooperation of the media without those journalistic with David Corn and Mike is it cost\nCutting out the information just regurgitate in the information that they receive from uh the people who were doing this behind the scenes\nOr I Can't believe that there's not enough outrage to realize what is actually going on here\nIs you have a ... a a series of reports put together known as the dusty by Christopher Steele\nThat's Hillary Clinton DNC funneled money through a law firm ... hiring fusion GPS and research firm then they hire Christopher Steele and they put together unverified uncorroborated in mostly now what turns out to be debunked information Joe diGenova\nFirst they use it to hurt Donald Trump and the general election you know the stories about you know Russian hookers\nUrinating in the bed in a in a mosque out rich Carlton for example that's all being leaked even by high members within our intelligence community for the purposes of influence in the election with a with a series of lies and propaganda\nThen the same information is used again to create a special counsel and to really deal legitimize and hopefully dismantled the presidency of Donald Trump that's when it came down to\nWell there's no doubt about it a dumb Sean that but as Victorian I have been saying now for Eighteen months there was a brace a plot\nBrazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally and that if she lost the election to praying Donald Trump and that is exactly what they did these people were motivated by an Anna this court Donald Trump which led them to fabricate evidence to use foreign intelligence service fabricate evidence\nWiretap Americans ... and then when they found exculpatory evidence for example that would have paper George Papadopoulos they hit it on but by the court there is no doubt\nThat number people John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and Jeff Sessions\nAnd Rod Rosenstein cannot figure out a way to do that and by the way John Huber ... Utah at the head fake\nDoing nothing six months without report and let the bread the budget and die tomorrow use what this is an outrage with Russia has been ... by tolerated either the credits waited till after the election to get rid of them and I say to hell with both of them All right\nThank you what's going to happen Jason ... you see a new attorney general down their own\nThoughts soon it off I just put up a piece that I wrote about sessions can't go soon enough worthless use their name only the really should be is that a second special counsel to look into Brandon and all these cast of characters we've been talking about over the last few minutes they did the president needs that employees\nWell here here president making that decision himself\nYeah absolutely you could push that or a ... and and releasing the documents to Congress absolutely\nYeah I think all of that needs to happen or orange twenty two days before the election we'll see what goes on from here a thank you all for being with us eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number what happened to the Washington Post reporter uh Jamal should cause showed the um accusations\nThat the Saudi crown prince is involved in the murder of this journalist will get into that also have the latest on the rioting that took place over the weekend both in Portland in New York City and much much more as we continue busy Newsday here on the Sean Hannity show only twenty two days till election day\nYou're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show we'll have more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up\n[noise]\nI needed new blind I knew I could save a ton of money if I put them in myself but I was nervous about measuring right and then installing them that's why I went to ... dot com I turned her ads on the radio or the number one online retailer custom window coverings\nBut I still had to install them so I called them I defined consulting Carla she talked me through it all from picking the right blind to installing them class online defined consultation was free samples were free shipping was free my home looks perfect\nThis holiday season impressed everyone who visits your home with brand\nNew made to order custom blinds from blinds dot com get inspired by before and after pictures read reviews and get the latest trends and colors and patterns that blinds dot com and right now you can save up to forty percent plus take an additional five percent off site wide when you use promote code Hannity\nThat's up to forty percent plus take an additional five percent off site why the blinds dot com blinds dot com promo code Hannity rules and restrictions\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trait tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nI think they deny it denied every way you can imagine and not too distant future I think we'll know an answer\nWhat are your options like they did what are your options which you can send her imposing sanctions [noise] as a bipartisan group of senators proposed what depends\nOn what the sanctions and give you an example they order a military weapons\nEverybody in the world one event or Russian wanted at China wanted we wanted it we got it and we had all of it every bit of what you've got that on why well Iran would I don't want to do [noise] blowing like Cain race here and all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of a\nLot of teams the word that's a pretty harsh words for his true\nHowever anybody much [noise] you know there's a lot to\nSay there's a lot at stake and [noise] maybe especially so because this man was a reporter to something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really\nTerrible in discussing about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see what's going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nBy the way the president on sixty minutes last night talking about the mysterious this appearance\nOf this reporter Jamal ... ah we have some new updates for you on it it looks like the Saudis are preparing to admit that he was killed in an interrogation gone wrong I'll get to that in a second we do have other breaking news\nUh twenty five now to the top of the hour glad you're with us\nIt looks like in Maine the Bangor police department along with the fire department and the local hazmat crew are on site at Susan Collins is Maine home investigating a suspicious package\nThe state's criminal investigation division is also assisting at the ongoing probe and reports of the alleged threat came after Cohen's ah course\nGave a key vote as it relates to confirming justice cabin on to the U.S Supreme Court prior to the voter office was day luge with threats against the senator and our staff\nIn one case the person didn't leave a name and number they threatened to literally rape one of my young female staffers ... quoted in the wall Street Journal last weekend Collins returned to Maine after Kavanaugh was sworn into office and address the media regarding her decision and she told reporters the supplemental FBI report\nThat she pushed for was a turning point that help to reach the decision to support cabin on despite the accusations that were leveled against him she actually gave due process um I've had this happen to me white powder sense of my office one side and an assistant to spend\nWhat the the varying rest of the day in a panic state in isolation because of this white powder you know these things that people do and in some cases it's actually real as in the anthrax case\nUh one other news about this more news on the Senate before we get to the issue of ... uh in Georgia you know this blue wave is a midterm election is apparently according to Georgia gubernatorial candidate saying well that's going to including illegal aliens\nBut the thing of it is the blue wave is African American as white it's Latino it's Asian Pacific Islander is disabled is differently abled it's L. V. I. L. GB T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are the candidates said\nAnd then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who were told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp\nTelling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia and said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in a gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Christian a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... Sally one of the important racist that we're following and how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy\nAnd the meth capital of the world and all the Washington Examiner apparently found emails that show cinema herself inviting a prominent group I'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\nIn Arizona called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day in a protest the war\nAnd they were threatening stake here\nYeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S Dan bungee you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely they're really two aggravating factor here when you already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that there's this ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual officers so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nAnd highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's a sign that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly\nTried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were supposed to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah they're ...\nTo ... and just to say that the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said\nIt seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president on that you know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we do not elevate it looks like they have like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to another link that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but\nMean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia on the\nAir and well okay you're going to happen I mean the the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and being told how to dress a being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up of you left\nIf you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under Sheree there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWas modernization and Saturday we saw it when that being able to drive we saw the ... the government that I had to wear it cut the ... I thought you were sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major us teammates and all\nThe people who dress observant link but it's such a great clean found that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it has been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to strike for many years and and this and this new\nRules or oppressive as it relates to Judaism and Christianity and lesbians or either slogged or killed is not true\nAbsolutely him but that's for me what's\nSo unfortunate about this incident and why I Hope it gets corrupted very quickly is that we will actually thing of modernization that seem liquor you need a more liberal or such\nTo women's rights limits education when driving and that played the crown prince had built up such good well around the world is because he was taking a different approach so really saddens me to see them go so far backwards from what was really an interactive with last year to change things\nRight last ...\nYeah Morgan's right they were trying to diversify the economy get away from us strictly Petro dollars\nAnd I mean this is an enormous enormous step back on\nYou know there there there's no covering this up if they have to admit that they did this ... and\nThe details of this come out there's a risk because we think there's going to be some explaining to do I just encourage everybody to keep the whole global picture in mind here uh when doing it we can't start World War three over this although sub there has to be a some form of a upcoming clean by the Saudis some form of a of retribution there's no\nDoubt that they want to pass it on to people in the conflict and I don't believe for a second that they didn't know or at least the crown prince did no sooner than this uh All right thank you all pre she ate it\nUh Morgan Ortega and are are good friend a dam bond Gino eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number next hour by the way we've got a lot coming up we'll get back to the rioting that took place in New York in Portland over the weekend Sally cold shutdown of pies herself as part of the resistance but you'd never be a part of those trust me quick break right back will continue\n[noise] Shaun\nHannity Michael bears tomorrow night today on TALK radio we receive ten WINZ [noise]\nAnyone tells you to flee to investing crypto currency has no idea what's about to happen next I'm ...

I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um I got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're gonna have to kick out citizens so that the men and women hunger is get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone in a letter\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ... to\nDo it but I still don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these

violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pull the trigger by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama that number one leave kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents\nAnd I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear\nI don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again well first of all your ... of nonviolent protest the phone calls the petition whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you have your seemed to be an example that Donald Trump really when people were stood up\nThank you got to hurt him if you look you know I'll get you in court don't worry about it are you on TALK marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing had no other sort of like well what I was saying oh no no no no no if you want me to the question I didn't take that and it's the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing\nThat I don't care if they're right wing or left wing if they're involved in this sprawling somebody is going to

C. A. as people with preexisting conditions had been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big\nRedistribution scheme now if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings account so we also talked about\nAtlas MD Dr Josh amber and Dr Lee s gross this model now

Ninety five percent reduction in the high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine addict greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care is local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors\nAnd one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now if we wait for a solution from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does to eliminate\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of

Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math\nAnd sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and and all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that talks could win now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign in St free health care for everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically have a governor saying illegal\nOr legal doesn't

with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction or the people\nAnd I experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't and I agree with you and you can get on it when they got to get out of California can't afford to pay taxes and all that\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look and why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey\nAnd Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas you know what what uh Democrats on what they're hoping

the site that his death took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that\nSays these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air do on and the Turkish foreign minister ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMy palm pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts the day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nTop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman Solomon\nAccording to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that show geese apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume if that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and in body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counselor wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen\nTo what's going on and we'll find out in this case um might take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should\nRush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr

what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions\nUh I think this man is that\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between\nTwo nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the first place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate on what was the journalist was Americans off that trying to spin it was a foreign

I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years um my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murders and the most evil Ruth ... brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point\nNot smart in my opinion yeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen cloudy traveled on the Gulf Stream Arab arrived at the cost of the day the show he entered\nAnd we know he just show again never exited the costs let's um we do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... the one of them forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly
