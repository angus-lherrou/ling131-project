I Know I Know the most Americans worked for a small business owner I\nPublicly traded companies there's only like four thousand give or take it less than the you know the will ... will share five thousand and that was a measurement of kind of the broad market for years\nAnd now there's not even five thousand publicly traded companies in that area in that in ... a share yeah but it's it's just gotten to where more and more as consulted 'cause that's been so cheap so there's been more and more consolidation than it has been or\nI'm going to start a new company and I'm going to take on investors so\nUh it kind of changes and and as\nDebt becomes more expensive than people will probably began to move back mortars that publicly\nOh yeah you know and and you know that's part of the fluidity that we're talking about when we say you want to be diverse the great things change you know right now like I said right now bond yields are not very good stock yields have been great\nUh you know over the next three to five years that may be completely the opposite right that doesn't mean you want to own all stocks and bonds right now it doesn't mean you're going to want to own all bonds and know stocks in five years right it just means ones doing better than the other right now so you probably need to have a little bit of both\nYou know to guard against the downside for either of them\nAnd that's another reason why working with us this is a smart move because he acted well we always say active\nTax planning or active investment planning is because things do change over a period of time things come in cycles\nAnd you want people who are keeping an eye on what's going on in the various whether it's the market or whether it's real estate or whether it's a what's going on a tax law you want somebody who knows what they're doing in that area because too many people operating off of what was true ten twenty Thirty years ago\nWhat made me money during the eighties is not necessarily what's kind of making money right now\nRight so some of those different areas that we we talked about you and I were discussing ... switch or I'm Still surprised a lot of people are unfamiliar with rates and I'll read says just Ari IT as it's a real estate a real estate investment trust and there's um well so explain that real quick I mean we can break it down yeah so\nBasically a real estate investment trust is just a tax status um that says we have to send out our income to our shareholders so that's all when you hear real estate investment trust you just think these people on real estate and they're not allowed to keep the profits they have to send it to the shareholders\n'em by law on by law yeah it's yeah or they lose their rate status um so basically a a group a team of people will say hey we've got this idea for a real estate venture that will make a lot of money but we need investors let's take on investors and then we'll give them the profits um and that's what they\nDo every can focus on hospitality and focus on health care they can focus on just a lot of yeah ... I mean you can get into any public\nStorage ... and and here's the key that some people that I mean that understand you know what I read it and understand they exist is usually they only know about publicly traded rates so this is a read this trading on the stock market like a ... and the price is going to fluctuate more like a stock\nBut what a lot of people don't realize is there's what's called non traded greets which basically means that they're invested in things that are out there their investments outside the stock market it's a correlation is going to be much lower what's happening within the\nYeah the ... going up or down is not going to affect the non traded read it All right um you know so that's that's again that's an important element of diversity because then diversity you want to safeguard against the ups and downs of other things\nAre so you know ... ... can be a great asset for a lot of people who need a little bit of diversification their portfolio\nSo you know folks if anything you're hearing your thinking why are you know I've never been taught this before I've never been told us before I've heard about that but I don't really understand it is this something that I should be looking at\nYou know the only way we could even begin to tell you that if we just come and say hey you should be investing in this you should listen to us any more than anybody else if we sit down and talk to people find out what their desires are with their hopes with their dreams are what their goals are what they want to accomplish what their risk tolerance is\nAnd then we come and try to help you put together a plan for yourself\nThat's going to get you where you want to go so if you'd like give us a call ... won five for for one twelve Seventy four well set up a time to sit down and just talk with you for an hour or so no charge I'll go sit down and give you a soft drink or water or whatever you wanna drink\nAnd just kind of get to know you and uh we'll go from there and see if there's something a there to be had a relationship between us and EU deserves a your purposes answers our purposes because we want to be a business with people that we want to work with and we want we want to help people that that we enjoy being around so we would love to have the opportunity to talk with you\nFor telling another area this one is the one that's scary for a lot of people's energy because they think of Enron which was you know Seventeen years ago or whatever but [noise] um and and they think of wild cat and you know I'm putting my money out on hoping that we are going to strike gold and\nYet now there's a lot of energy that's very conservative um you know also energy sector that the government tends to um give tax breaks for a at times depending on what exactly invest in um you know energy and other great option you know it's not a it's not for everybody it's um\nYou know it's just something different to look at typically you're energies are going to pay better dividends going to be a little less growth oriented are great for retirees as a general rule\nAnd there again you can have publicly traded or non traded\nShare and an issue with anything in another one I think that kinda ties in between those would be a business development company yeah basically like a ... but with debt right basically think instead of buying real estate there by and mortgages\nOil and that sort of ask you to develop the whole 'cause you've mentioned it earlier we talked about bonds bonds and performing so why is because that sounds like a bad thing sure why is dead and investment\nClass yeah so dead obviously gets interest or bonds having been performing because ah bonds have a set interest rate as a general rule and that they get over that term\nOr so as interest rates go up or down it affects the performance of the bond or in a business development company typically the rate that they charge is going to be a floating ... so if rates go up there the interest that they're getting goes up if rates go down the interest that they're getting goes down\nSo the price and the return stays a consistent and makes the process\nThey serve a role in me to me kind of and I don't wanna say middle America kind of middle class business America yeah in the sense that it's you know it's not the big companies are going to loan billions of dollars to some major corporation you know some huge conglomerate and but they're also not the groups that are going to loan to me are you to go out and buy a house or buy some land\nThey're going to meet that need for that middle sized company and middle sized company can be you know what ... million a million ... I mean it'll be a huge company\nBut um but it it's just I'm\nA niche that gets lost a lot of time so some other areas and we're not going to develop delve into these a whole bunch or they're not things that we deal with a whole bunch but you know there's commodities futures options things like that they tend to be a little bit higher risk\nAnd it's not that there's not a place in time for these it's just that we tend to work with people\nWho are trying to grow their assets to prepare for retirement and then to preserve their assets to live throughout retire because as we said earlier there are people now who are living almost as long retirement as they as all the years that they were in the job market and they got to make that money last so folks are we would love to have the chance\nTo sit down and talk with you to discuss this and see if it's something that we can help you to Disney and we'd love to serve you just have the opportunity to\nSee if you were a good match for you and if you'd like give us falling six one five for for one twelve Seventy four will be glad to meet you at any time that we can um and uh we're Tennessee tax busted for ... by grand retirement tax advisory where to serve you you just give us a call\nSecurities off their tails capital and investment advisory services all through canals management one five to five ... what's our cooperative Georgia three zero zero zero five six seven eight three five six seven hundred Brennan retirement in taxes feeling or some sort of ... for cables management\nTelomeres investment advisor were jak Peter and associates I think the register investment advisor dedicated to focusing climbing afford a decision that Siri demands that retirement advisory services are only offer the client or prospective clients were executor associate editor percentages are properly licensed\nLike on my part of life and what form of ... or the rights of reform I harbor who who are [noise] well from our mouth off of\nI look back to the money to like show here on TALK radio for\nTime you might want to sell mortgage\nI don't I mean talking about [noise] what do you need to know about the ... process\n[noise] and the key things down payment income verification credit as documentation [noise] um and impartial\nThird party appraisal which that's a loaded question right there loaded statement right they're stable income and good ... good credit history\nAnd before the break we were really talking about the credit stuff and we were starting to transition into your job and you know it's part of the American dream to kind of for some Americans it is to own your own company ... and stop working for\nYou know a Boston punching the clock and you know go out on your own and do your own thing I don't know I mean you you ... another example but I'm example of it and it's it's it's fun it's rewarding and a lot of times\nYou make a whole lot more money when you get on your own and you do you do do you own thing man\nBut the problem with when somebody tries to go out on their own right when they're trying to buy houses\nYear pay structure is completely changes and when the key things on this list is stable income now\nYou may be making more money self employed but the problem with that is you don't receive weekly paychecks are bi weekly paychecks or monthly however you're old companies to pay\nUs self employed you really only have one paycheck that gets reported to the IRS once a year once a year ... turn that your tax return you think draws you do take drugs but it's not your pay and the read the differentiating factor here is ... is that\nWith if you are on at St taken a drop off where you are paying yourself however you want to do it\nYou're not paying taxes on that you don't pay taxes until the end of the year but during the year you're accumulating all these expenses that you're going to take those expenses and subtract them from your profit or your income and what's left is your profit\nAnd with the self employed rules you can take advantage of the IRS tax codes that allow you to write everything off to the point where you might not pay any taxes period\nBut the problem with that is you're not shown any income either oh yeah but you just get it at all wrote it all off to reduce tax liability in contrast back to a W to employee who's working for a company they gotta pay step every week we can see the trend we can predict it we know what's going on it's good stable steady income\nNow back to the self employed you can only show your paycheck I your tax returns once every year so until you start following your tax returns you don't have any proof of Lincoln\nSo if you try to make the transition from a W to employee to self employed while you're trying to buy a house or even trying to refinance house you're gonna run into a lot of problems because there's no way to document drink even if you're making two three four times more money\nThere's no way to document it till you file your taxes\nYet we have I have friends that are self employed and they ride every every now and they make nice and they make a nice little yeah but they show they don't make hardly any money and then they can't figure out why they can't get alone yeah you know or wife you forget about it you know they've been self employed for ten Fifteen Years yeah\nAnd uh you know you guys I don't know I don't know this but you guys have a\nA R R under federal guidelines that say that the people have to give it up yet to be able to prove that people can repay alone among all the five mortgage rural setting there's a lot of factors that go into it and part of it is making sure you've done your due diligence to make sure somebody could actually have a have a chance to repay the loan\nUm and if you gave them alone and they showed that they have no ability to repay you could be held accountable for that ... has a lender and so\nYeah you're going to want to find out can you actually repay the loan yeah I Know you make money you don't show you'd make any money this I mean I don't want to pay more taxes than I have to really really unfortunate but I'm In part of paint it is what it is what it is and living in this country we live in is is you have to pay your your share of the taxes at that point in time to do it\nWe know we've always reported our income we've always showed that\nUm you know the truth profit and loss of our business without writing it off and I got friends of mine that just tell me I'm so ridiculous and how much money I waste and but uh you know it's just\nHow it is and what it is and and I don't have any problems if I tried to go out because I've got a track record that my business you know that that I can still making a living gifts exactly and ah so I don't really have any problems to do that\n[noise] yeah and it's as Chris said it it's not as his lenders 'cause justice if you know some of these people we know it's tough when you know the person is coming to you and you know they can afford the payments but yet you can't prove\nThey have no no way of proving\nThe yeah and it's and you can't pull weeds lenders can't pull any strings and we have a lot of strings we can pool when it comes to this but there's no way to work the rules into used to be yeah\nAnd that's what's got a lot of problems with the outer history was generally stated income loans and it was particularly for people like that who wrote everything off and getting through to show that made money they just had to say yeah this is how much money I make yeah and you got a base alone off of that\nYeah you would literally just say I make thirty grand a year I mean thirty grand a month [noise] ... in the mid like OK there is no no way to verify it no reason to verify the rules that require it\nAnd so when people started to fall to no notes that is one of the things that the government went in and kind of re did was yet are going out to see what went wrong and they found out that well people really weren't making that much money as they know they were and they didn't really have the income that they said that they did on these documents and\nAnd so yeah so they can the the regular just come back and said okay you have to prove that Linder yes and so the lenders go OK buyer we have to borrow we have to prove that now so now we're going needed documentation\nFull documentation any you know if you're listening to this and you've been through this problem or you've been told hey you need two years of some ... tax returns [noise]\nGive us call against on five five eight five fifty nine hundred\nBecause you can if you have one year's worth of tax returns you can still get approved or let's say you have\nUm declining come from ... in this case let's use\nSixteen Seventeen you made more money and sixteen than you did and Seventeen and they should have clients more than twenty five percent for whatever the reason is that is a major red flag and if you've been turned down for that let us know give us a call again\n'cause there's ways to work around stuff there are banks do put overlays movies will just put overlays mature additional rules and restrictions that are over above\nThe sand the requirements but give us a call will walk you through it will look at your situation and see if we can help um basically to uproot when other people have said\nNo we'll end up giving the road map I mean the bottom line really it just got to reach out to a professional like my office to find out where you stand for so I don't think you can just get along because you make a lot of money now and you don't and you don't show any but don't think you can't get alone\nBecause you either don't show any or you're just not even sure what your credit history looks like at that point in time because\nYou know there's a bunch of people lost self employed people in this world yes and they are borrowing money yeah and uh and so there is ways to get that done you just got to do it within the confines of the structures that the government requires for lenders to be able to operate in\nYeah and there's ... ways that we can add things back in and all that good stuff but [noise] I I mean I Can't tell you how many times I've seen people with the gross you know gross income totals at four big six figure numbers at some seven figure incomes but yet when you go down to the bottom line adjusted gross income", "show_name": "Money Man Mike", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
