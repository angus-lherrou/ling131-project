{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Makes you run out of your personal assets even faster which something I wasn't I didn't stay in our last segment but today I mean we're living in a yo yo economy\nYour on your own why oh why oh right right and uh the way the pension for the most part is is going the way of the dinosaur which means we got Social Security and we got our personal assets to live on in retirement and and we're living longer in retirement\nThan ever before and history ship so those different factors are starting to add up to a very difficult situation for a lot of people\nAnd it can be avoided if you put a little bit of tax financial and legal planning in place to make sure that you as an individual or as a family unit you know they were really doing what's best for you\nOr as an individual so it doesn't happen on its own no it does not ... you definitely need to work with somebody or or go out and do the research yourself in ...\nReally look into it but I Would recommend working with a group of people are if not us here at Grand at retirement tax advisory someone else\nWho has the tax specialists illegal estate planning specialists and the financial specialists all on staff\nTo help you because all three of those things are going to come into play and just about every bodies are later life planning retirement planning for it and tax planning but you can give us a call six one five for for one twelve Seventy four\nAnd a ... you can also check out at clear retirement dot com but we'd be happy to meet with you give you a second opinion or maybe a show you some of the\nThe tools that you can use to better yourself for retirement\nAnd just a couple of things I Want to throw in there one there are some upsides deferred accounts it's not that we don't ever have the verdict out so it might just want to briefly hit on a couple of those but the second one I Would always say\nI always tell people and challenge people is they'll come in to office LA Times with their four one K. statement that they may have all their retirement assets and one K. and they say I I think the national average is like forty forty five percent but we see people\nWho have awkward Seventy eighty percent or more within their qualify to a retirement account is tax deferred account right exactly ... haven't been paid yet that Uncle Sam owns part of but\nAh the thing that you know I always try to nicely conveyed to people as they might say well I have a hundred thousand dollars sitting in my four oh one K. so I have a hundred thousand dollars for my retirement and I probably have to explain to them you don't\nYou have a hundred thousand dollars and Uncle Sam has a hundred thousand dollars to you all share together in that account you're not sure how much of that is yours if you don't do some planning\nYeah and the great thing is here's the good news hopefully everybody's stay tuned for the fourth segment where actually bring up the good news so here's the good news is that you you can't control these things you can take a larger stake in your own financial situation by\nPutting into place just some very very simple things things that don't happen on their own\nThat um unfortunately the government doesn't really encourage us to do because it works in our favor more than in their favor but there are ways to balance your tax situation from an investment standpoint so that when you get into retirement or when you turned Seventy and a half and you have to start taking your required minimum distributions\nThat you have more control over your your marginal tax bracket you have more control over a at what rate your Social Security as taxed if it's even tax that all we can give you that control\nBut you have to call us and we have to sit down I have to put a plan in place because it will not happen on its\nOwn own a talking about you you are going to get out of paying taxes we are talking about you have to follow tax law with planning and investment the investment regulations you have to follow those in such a way that you can do these things it's not just going to come in and we're going to say hey you had to worry about payment I have\nMy magic can any taxes one I just wave over people's account yeah and they don't have to pay any more taxes\nSomebody tells you about that and Ryan lightly excuse of and get out of that I Know\nBut but if you make you make a good point so we're not helping anyone that void tax rate because ... we have to pay taxes but we're not going to jail for any we're not going to jeopardy because we have to take control of our tax situation because if we're not in control of it if we don't put things in place so that we can control it\nWho do you think controls as right it's not saying that's right\nAnd we see how they spend their money and when we see what they think about social programs and it you know it and they're just trying to lower the national debt and they're making more problems trying to clean up old problems and it it we just they can't get\nCaught well what do we talked about before with with people you know I often say you know it's not people who argue stuff like a trickle down economics or you know this tax rate versus a tax rate I mean we just had a big knock down drag out about a two point six percent tax cut\nAt the top level when historically we've been fifty sixty Seventy Ninety percent\nHas been the top ... tax level you know so we get more to that another time but uh people don't realize that there are ways to just do things today that are going to help you down the road but once you get down the road there still some things we can help you with but they're not like the planning you can get done today yeah\nThat's true time time can be your greatest ally or your greatest enemy yeah and it's all dependent on how you use it\nAnd the unfortunate thing that I've noticed uh being in this industry as long as I have is that\nThe average person weights past the point of opportunity right for ... maximum opportunity for the clarification because there's always some opportunity but the average person weights past the point of maximum out opportunity to capitalize on what they've saved right for their retirement\nAnd uh most people don't think you know they come in and uh yeah we're we're I'm about to retire my last days in three months what can we do and I'm like well first off I Wish that we started talking two years ago um\nWe usually do say handout ally with the ...\nBut the truth is is that if you're about to retire and three months now is the time yeah you know in in\n... you may you may\nAfter you talk with somebody wish that you'd come in earlier but\nWe live in a society of ah stuff in our face right we got the Internet we've got marketing we've got too much from it yeah too much information thrown at us all the time and we start to just focus on what seems to be the most urgent\nAnd a lotta times unfortunately for close to retirees people in their fifties coming up uh towards retirement in the next decade or star Fifteen Twenty years or so\nUm they're not thinking about how do I structure my assets a day for Fifteen Years from now because there's too many other\nThings take care of right and you know I I was on ... philosophical for a moment I was talking to my college student here recently and I was like you know your generation and and really it's it's all generations living today whether you're twenty or ... or eighty you know it doesn't matter you're everybody's been affected by this but this the first generation to be a race like this\nIs for ever it has been who ever has access to the information has the power has the control whoever has the education has the power has the control for the first time in history weren't ... everybody's got access to all the information and it's\nWho can weed through all the junk right and focus on what's important\nAnd and getting back to what you were ... the reason I bring this up because what you were saying is we get so overwhelmed that we don't do\nAnything yeah and so the thing is whether you're twenty twenty five thirty all the way up to retirement name of the numbers there you go out to go through a mall but or whatever your age is there something about where you're at and your life right now with your planning\nThat there's something you should be thinking about playing for so we talk a lot on a here because a lot of our clients are pre retirement or dirt in retirement um and so we talk a lot\nTargeting towards people who are a little bit older but the truth is if you're young you should be thinking about should be putting my money into a taxpayer to defer to count how should I maximize my four one K. or fourth ruby if I'm going to\nHow should I be using a Ross versus a traditional i._r._a. or should I be and how does that apply to my situation and and the truth is it's just so much information out there that you can ... if you're smart and he was an all time educating yourself on this stuff a lot of people can't but\nWe see people come in with about Seventy five percent of the information making really bad decisions yeah because they don't really have the total picture so that's why we just really make it easy for people to sit down and talk to us so we can provide some education and then if you decide to work with us great and if you don't that's fine\nYeah you know I always I always talk about my car so I'm I'm not a car guy I don't know how to work on my car I think I'd be very interested to learn how to work on my car but I'm not going to too many other things if too many others\nAnd we and we know some guys that are unbelievable out\nYeah so then you find a good mechanic that you trust that you can come to and say hey this is the sound this piece of junk making leaving and they'll give you their opinion if they let me let me look under the hood let me get my hands in there and see if I can make sense of it and if I can make sense of it I'll fix it and this is how much it will cost rise that sound fair\nAbsolutely it does so youre going to take the weight off my shoulders you're gonna make sure that my car that gets me for me to be and gets me there safely is going to get continue to get their meat\nAir sake\nFrom those of the bombing and electrical broadcast better this is talk radio not boy three on tell me what I said to be do ten Fifteen ten\nReal Larry I\nCannot slur a mass shooting in Pittsburgh it happens at the tree of life synagogue in the world hill neighborhood local media now reporting eight people are dead is Pittsburgh Police officials saying a short time ago\nYou like maintenance things you can do\nStuff [noise] so I got a question for you yeah you're buying a house as is do you get home inspection absolutely okay and then why is it important to have a home inspection if you're buying a house as is\nTo make sure there's no sense it makes you not want to buy it or yeah but you're buying it as it so it's not the way your agents sadly she rotten it up to say after my inspection period I'll accept it as is protecting\nYour interest you're right you're angle she works for you not to sell it to check in what I mean the cell that might be trying to find something under the table\nRight it doesn't preclude your choice of having a home in the exactly because I said you either have to buy it as it's that they're not\nThat the people you're using you know to surround yourself with in the business I mean if I'm selling the house to somebody I'd never going to say oh you don't need a home inspection now that is not going to come out of the mouth ever\nKnow you always want to home inspection its its insurance you pay for all the time whether it's car insurance life insurance homeowner's insurance you pay for insurance but the day you need it you want it and that's the way I view homeowners and it's a homo home inspection is like insurance you ought to almost\n... almost like appraisals I think sometimes when you get ten home inspectors out there I think you're going to a different value about what\nThe ... like some different to you know yet how do you choose a good one than well I mean there's I don't ever get just one guy I give you like and listen to six or you know ... you know people have you know that I feel are ... um I trustworthy and have good integrity right you know the correct credential\nThan ever been up there when they're home inspected oh sure yeah okay until you're kinda walking around making sure they're actually looking\nFor the summary and kind of let them you know walk through with the buyers and they educate us on everything a lot of good things about the home inspection other than just what's wrong with the house is\nWhere's your you know where's your stuff where your water chef things you need to know if something goes wrong that otherwise you may not know that I mean some people are more savvy than others or you know do home in ... improvements and what not and some people have no clue so\nYou know that it's interesting you brought that up because I mean how many people really know where they're shut off up as in all that it happens all the time and then as soon as the moment comes up that you need to find it you have no clue where it's at\nAnd you know what I'll be looking back and actually I learned that I had somebody call me the other day right when they turn their heat on which I'm sure that's happened all over but they're like or he's not working downstairs now I'm like looking in their home and say okay it's gas did you turn on your dad yeah but yeah I mean we figured it out but I bet a lot of agents got called when I got called\nIt it is something that gets overlooked but yet the people discredit or think it's not no big deal but I mean\nIt's worth the extra four hundred and forty bucks whatever you're being charged for your home inspection and um [noise] I wouldn't do buy a home without it so [noise]\nHey we've got to jump out to a break but uh [noise] we're going to get into some very interesting topics today and one is are we shifting from a seller's market to a buyer's market a lot of things are said about that a lot of people don't really understand what the differences between the two\nSo we're not jumping to that and put that to bed and then also talk about the markets slowing down\nA following the appreciating what the market so [noise]\n[noise]\n... agreement and we're

I mean I guess people just don't know that they can get that off of there at that point a to sit in that fifty percent loan to value wouldn't I mean 'cause the first thing come to my mind is I'm so sick of paying the stuff I can I get it when can I get it off my loans to pay it anymore I just don't know that I Would have ... why would wait till fifty percent\nTo get to that point so that it is they're just ...\nWhen the first hand and it's Seventy or eighty well we're we're we're getting ready to jump into all that but I'm just wondering what might be what the mindset would be if it's just lack of knowledge on or or have somebody forgot about it or or what do you think that driving factor is its\nLack of knowledge I think lack of knowledge it's a combination of lack of knowledge um you basically pay your mortgage every month to forget about it it's just like your homeowner's insurance you almost insurance increases by twenty five per se I mean twenty five dollars [noise]\nUh well ... and that extra you know and you just kind of forget about it's out of sight out of mind everything could set up an auto payments and you're not looking at the actual statements you just pay it\nWell there's plenty of parts of national we have talked about that continually has double digit price increases value increases year after year here we've seen it we we know it and so if somebody even if they borrowed the maximum that could borrow on a house when they purchase it whether it's Ninety seven Ninety five percent\nOf a double double digit increase I mean they'd be out of that threshold quick [laughter] really fast yeah\nAnd and then that comes into the whole mindset will it's going to cost me ... how much am I rarely going again and they'd I hear so many times people say if you points less or some ... am and I'm like that drives me nuts and I'm like look and so many people don't understand this and lenders don't use the ... schedules and you plug in\nTo the images Asian scheduled shows exactly how much of your payment your pain every month is going towards principal interest period\nAnd you can set up an amber does Asian schedule that shows what you're paying now how much is going towards principle how much is going to be going the principal and payment two hundred and fifty six and how much is going to interest it'll show you the entire thing and if you can read your bank statements you can read this and we simply turn around and put a new amortization skills right by ms okay if you re fi\nHere's what you're looking at and now it's it doesn't you don't have to listen to me and take my word for it to do I think it makes sense or not the numbers are right there they don't buy\nLocal things you've talked about before which I Love is that you know you always have to be make a less of a payment you could always even reduce your term yeah I mean maybe you're just you're okay with making that pain that you know and you could show people how hey\nJust keep making the same payment knock five years six years and years off you're alone to ah to do this and that gets you all paid off a whole lot quicker so to me if I'm used to making the payment I just want to get a goal ... so\nWe don't realize how deep it doesn't matter if it's a hundred thousand dollars a million dollar twenty five bucks extra month it adds up oh yeah it adds up the lower you pay that principal now the less amount there is less amount there is this us interest to\nHold up his and then you pay interest on that balance threat where you're paying down with less money the bank it's at the end of the day you know people always talk about that we used to have the truth than lending form which had that big old nasty number on it that showed how much your total payment was over the course of the loan which was a you know everybody's like one way or whatever amount\nTo you know but we we still have that number in the last page of the closing disclosure and it's and it's in a real ... and you know they hide it it it's a ... but it's still on there I can assure you have yeah and it shows you what the total number is ... and people are still like a\nGood thing as you can pay it off or you know that's where the ... which you know ... which is great options of water rights do an on ...

A. J. lo nowadays which is a government backed loan you know before the mortgage insurance would come off yeah once you reach the eighty percent threshold and they've changed that after\nThe uh the housing crisis that we recently went through and so if you if you have a conventional loan and you pay mortgage insurance once you reach a certain threshold which is that\nEighty percent you can request for it to be terminated on government loans no matter what your loan to value as you pay murders insurance the end for the entirety of that loan so you know don't be waiting to\nThink you're going to a threshold the bench is going to come off it's never going to come off if you have a government loan and as the appreciation of our market continues in double digits you maybe at that threshold already\n[laughter] yeah I mean that dates actually June third two thousand Thirteen if you took out an F ha loan after June third around or after June third two thousand Thirteen and you did not put down ten percent or more your your life for life\nIt doesn't matter if you pay that thing down to where you only oh five thousand dollars in the original loan was five hundred thousand dollars you're paying him my for life\nUnless the refinery convention alone or\n... yeah yeah so we we've talked about why you don't want ... quite a bit so when are the situations when you want in mind when do you want to pay ... plays ...\nHome and you have programs that allow people to get out of it or different options for payment options I guess not really get out of it but if they're required to have a smarter ways of dealing with it I think you more economical ways deserve some economical ways of dealing with it or somebody else conflict or for that paying them to uh to be able to do that\nSo you know we've been talking about appreciation now if you're sitting here concerned about you're going to pay interest on a house but yet if you're going to continue to rent [noise]\nWhat are you gaining nothing nothing you're paying somebody else's mortgage whereas if you get into the game and now you you're part of your home owner and now you\nThis house and you've got a ... growing every month every year and on top of that you're paying down on your principal you are just driving equity in net wealth for you and your family going forward wherever you continue to rent\nYou're just paying somebody else mortgage and we've got to jump out to a break when we come back we're going to give you some pretty eye opening numbers at talk about this and then we're also going to talk about some smarter more economical\nWays of dealing with their my and get more money towards your principal instead of going towards additional fees and don't do any good Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W.
