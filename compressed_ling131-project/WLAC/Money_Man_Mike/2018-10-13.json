{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Give us a call or checking out a clear retirement dot com but Craig's going to take some time in our last segment today to talk about some of the changes um in the new tax law that are going to affect the the most most people right right and I am in the\nIn the thing is is is if you want to receive updates about some of the stuff that is actually getting codify and we're actually seeing what the end result is going to be we're going to be doing as part of our newsletter that we do through the website ...\nOr you just go on the website for the newsletter through constant contact and Leslie sending out newsletters with updates about the tax law changes so you guys can be educated on your end so just remember to do that if you want to find out some of the stuff did you listen to the radio show\nShe on the website ... stuff and you're like what you're saying and you want to be on the list of getting some of this information to you so you can be better informed\nSo when we do to your implanting would you or we do text preparation with you in the spring you should know about what's going on with the law changes and how it affects might affect you\nAnd that was clear retirement dot com\nAnd that's why it's so hard on the radio show to not get so specific into something that nobody's going to pay attention to somewhat talk about some of the things that affect pretty much everybody\nThe big tax savings or at least time savings thing that was mentioned was the new standard induction they basically doubled the standard deduction so a married couple headed standard adoption of twelve thousand seven hundred dollars as now twenty four thousand\nFor each one of those over sixty five was Thirteen hundred dollars so if a married couple are both over at sixty five their new standard it actually is twenty six thousand six hundred dollars\nWhich will mean for a lot of people they don't have to worry about keeping track of all their itemized deductions right so what sales tax pay what my medical bills are about charity those type of things or do I resent that I'll have to keep track of\nNow during the planning that we've been doing was people I'm also recognizing in educating people on the fact that your church church down what's called a cash basis so you can control when you pay your property tax bill\nEven if it's Astros some escrow companies are allowing their people to tell them I Want to pay the bill in January or I Want to pay and semper\nSame type of thing a lot of her share of contributions or I've had I've talked to people this year so far that are already going to maximize out their medical bills so they're already going to have a ... because of medical bills are so far this year that weren't covered by insurance\nOr between now ... year run out and get your eyes checked you hear in check any of the things you're going to do anyway and tried to budge things into this year so what we still have the opportunity to do is called budging so if you're off the coast of being able to ... you can't control when you make sort of things\nSo few budget was two thousand nine Jane where you're making your two years' worth of property\nTaxes in one year shifting some of your chair contributions or you're right in the chicken January's that are December that allow you to itemize in two thousand that chain and then just as an Eighteen you're sticking the standard deduction\nOver the two year timeframe you're spending the same amount of money but you're getting a bigger tax benefit one year and the second the senator next\nSo those little things like that can help people maximize the effect there in what they're going to end up paying taxes because I also quite the standard deduction increased to like a magic show\nI said the magician which is the government's waving their hands and say hey you're a double standard ... they're going to be so much easier for people and they're going to be great [noise] they're not telling the other side which which is I removed your personal exemptions\nSo for some people are meeting with the higher standard deduction is giving them a bit reduction they had previously\nFor some people are meeting with without the personal exemptions being added to the standard deduction they were going to get anyway they're having a less of that action on the return this year and they had previously\nSo those are some of the things to watch out for what is what's being done besides all the hype due to me I don't care what the politicians talk about rates all kinds of stuff I've learned is thirty plus years ago what does it do to my Irish her\nBut at the bottom line and we always talk about it's not you know we don't we don't talk politics a lot we taught math yeah because it's what's what's the math say you know it's a mess eighty six\nWere ... was Ronald Reagan and he was known as the guy that came in and cut tax rates\nA true statement\nBut for a lot of middle class people their taxes actually increased because things become tax will have not previously ... taxable or things that were had been to duck to a previously we're no longer deductive\nAny earnings income ceiling came way down so yeah that at the bottom on you\nThat's that's a that's a common misunderstanding with with taxes is that\nThe tax rate like if they changed tax rates that that's going to make a huge difference but there are so many things that can be tweaked in changed in our tax law that can affect your taxes other than the rights yeah well I a politician could come in and lower rates and still raise your tax bill\nSo that you don't don't be fooled 'em by by like like what Craig said you know that that big shiny object in the right hand when the left hand has a a rotten apple in it you know and they're trying to hide it from you\nI'm because there there is more in the tax law that affects your bottom dollar line than just what rates are like\nGreg just said how's it gonna affect you we don't know we don't know your situation we sit down and look at your situation right since you know what to do the analysis we don't know the analysis of you want\nAn analysis won't cost anything just to swing on by or give us a call well don't swing on by Frank\nErik might be that if you want to you want to make an appointment so give us a call ... for for one twelve Seventy four we want to make sure Craig is in the office you're coming to before she says swing by ... by for for one twelve Seventy four or you can contact us for an appointment at clear retirement dot com so what ... what do you always say about what\nElse are you going to be in on the particular day\nOr look at the counter and go into\nThe guy Craig Craig cliff and myself are a couple a vagabond than we do we around travel between the offices depending on where appointments\nDuring taxes and I have routine hours routine days that I'm In certain offices so that could make you more convenient for clients so they know that I can be a certain office but outside of that for this routine appointments we kind of earlier this week I was in three out of the four officers in one day yeah this running between apartment\nWhere the appointments are so if you would like to make an appointment get uh Craig or one of our tax specialists to look over your situation and\nI give you a little bit of input or again the number six five four four one twelve Seventy four or you can check us out of clay retirement dot com Craig are there any changes that kind of stuck out to you for business owners small business owners or professions\nOut into the the the planning opportunity has never been more dire than it is now it will continue to be because basically what they've done is they have said if you or a small business owners schedule C.\nOr pass through ... owner which is comes off of a K One through the rest corporation or partnership\nThat the side of the company makes a hundred thousand dollars\nYou're only going to be taxed on eighty\nSo that it affects isn't right adjustment but it's a known right adjusted 'cause we don't know how the flow through is going to end up on your return\nBut also that depends on what your total income is I've been talking to people in recent weeks that are making substantial income right now and there's chaps to that ... percent reduction in your taxable income\nSo if you make over a certain amount depending on your marital status\nThey can say now what does that would give it to ...\nAnd that's where I ended up being the bad guy tax time because of somebody in that situation didn't come in for some you're in planning and missed an opportunity to restructure how their income coming in great art accelerate their deductions for the year\nBut somebody in retirement account which qualifies to help reduce your income\nThen that's going to be a missed opportunity I Can't undo right I can just be the bad guy tax time until you're over pay on taxes if you're coming back in the fall we should've base of a justice to get a better result yeah so that's one of the reasons I started off the whole show today was saying is never been more important time\nThan now for the planning yeah out of it because there are a lot of things in this new law that people are going to mess because they didn't know\nAnd that's a key point because it doesn't really matter whether it's a good change or a bad change that I mean the matters but that's not the most significant thing the most significant thing is it's a huge change\nAnd you need to know how it's going to affect you was it the right and you can either wait and find out after you file your taxes next year or when you fill out something on line through TurboTax or something\n\nFrom them want to get electrical broadcast that this is talk radio not only three I'll tell you what they see these ten Fifteen to end\nFor hostage is I'm ham who's now Fox News that in a tweet from President Trump plans to meet this afternoon and they all the law fest with American Pie after Andrew Brunson Brunson is heading home to the U.S after being held in Turkey for nearly two years on charges related to espionage and terrorism\nTheir living room like a real living room and on top of that also are like well I'm enjoying it earned again\nSo I don't know I didn't go so\nYou know they're also getting a benefit out of it but their house also went under contract and I got better at data pictures and it did paint the picture and it\nSold it went under contract almost immediately when they're probably saying why are we sold is again yeah now that we're enjoying it [laughter]\nYeah having a soldier more so I guess you'd call\nIt I mean you know the study goes on to say fifty percent of the stage home saw an increase in dollar values from one to ten percent\nSo by your perceived that the house was worth more I guess they're they're trying to say here because they could see the way they would live in the house themself because so many people are visual and if you're\nNot a visual person then you can kind of\nFigure it out yourself up so many people are visual they need to see it come to understand that sometimes and you walk into like you're saying a a house which choppy or the child before plant or a unique for plan your instantly questioning hey will\nWell our couch but there were TV fit your what about are done I mean you you don't Yuri answering this question for them yeah yeah and it's instantly without it even becoming up coming up as any kind of a obstacle or anything like\n... okay here's a staging question for you Andrew okay so this is a company comes in states do house and then the ... you know we love it when ... ... and we were all the furniture that's currently in it sometimes that's negotiable aren't credit no that yeah yeah\nAnd I will say this them most of the design I mean I did in my experience anyway most of the time when houses are staged a are vacant homes that makes him a ... when you live in your house I mean what are you going to like furniture yeah I mean sometimes you'll have a few pieces brought in here and they're like you you know you're not essentially delightful\nOn stage um but if it's a fully stage house where you're hiring a professional to come in and do the whole ship bang it's usually make at home yeah I can see that like a builder home or of a flip yeah and you know yeah and I see where they bring in those numbers especially when it's like a little small\nYou know twelve hundred square foot house in an area that is just starting to turn and they go in and stage it to where it's just cute as a button and you know the wife comes in and just lovely ...\nFell in love and I said and stuff he's riding high top dollar for that ... even though that stuff\nDon't read it you gotta buy all that it happens they go on to say in his article at the top rooms of stage in order to attract more buyers is deliver ...\nMaster bedroom kitchen and dining room which makes it makes a lot of sense yes so if you're curious about stage and her don't think you see the value in it um I think again\nCheck out on line and when I'm In my bed net will put this article out there and we've got a job up to a break but we'll come back we'll talk about first time home buyers and the fact that first time homebuyers continued to put less than six\nPercent down when they are by ... percent down\nAnd we're doing some loans with zero down but less than six percent down so your question whether or not you have enough money to make this work or you need to give them more likely we can make it work for you to listen to them and make show here on TALK radio Fifteen ten

and the Houston Astros [noise]\nTo the money man my show here on TALK radio ended up ... to talk of things are really like a\nTo\nPay a\n[noise] so first time homebuyers [noise]\nYup they're out there how many times do you meet\nWith a client because a lot of times you will talk to them first before they even go into the process and then sometimes are already pre approved but when you talk to the ones that are not ...\nAnd I don't say this\nTo be negative or anything but sometimes they are clueless on really what's going on and sometimes they've gone out on the on line and they read so much information they confuse themselves potentially absolutely they really don't know what's right what's wrong or what the shooter shouldn't do [noise]\nSo the the next best thing is coming to somebody like you are myself for somebody that's professional an industry that can basically substrate yet but six percent down\nFor first time homebuyers is the number that uh the national ... national\nAssociation of realtors uh put out again and another a recent publish a publication they released and stated that sixty one percent a first time homebuyers purchase their homes with a down payment less than six percent during two thousand Seventeen [noise]\nNice I mean that's\nThat just ... I mean it blows my mind but it it doesn't because we do it every day but I mean for the people that we do talk to and they are like how much do I have to have to put down to I mean\nThat you know a lot of people that go F ha they put three or five percent downright angry and a half or five yeah\nOkay so that's kind of go in right with that Jay ... a lot of people go as age\nUm and that's probably I don't know I I'd say maybe that\nPeople know the ... well I don't know and to the ... you know people don't waves is like a bunch of our time bars all at once and then I'll have a bunch of seeds environmental enough\nAnyway it it's it's surprising that sixty one percent the name but that is the one piece it's kind of surprising is sixty one percent of people bought a house with less than six percent down\nBecause the flip side of this is obviously a lot of people put a lot of money down\nWell yeah now because it but most of those are people selling the house\nBingo so it comes back to the first time homebuyer thing is really the Dickey qualifier here but I mean yeah if you're if you're thinking you cannot buy a house because you don't have enough money down I mean there's ways to do if a J with\nI don't know if I agree with that guy I mean they have the data to support it but I mean they're saying that home affordability is not a challenge and the majority of the country now at the surface what's that mean to you\nAs a real ...\nIt means that most parts of the country homes are affordable [laughter]\nWhat about you Jimmy um what was the question again\n[laughter] you back they're doing all your uh I'm On the ... weren't looking at numbers you know you're watching the numbers and make sure they attract\nThe this report shows that many ... even though there are several metros around the ... a county ... county country I'm Still thinking David metro area around the country that don't necessarily have an affordability issue ...\nWhat what do you think about that when you write an article you 'cause it seems like at least in this area of the house just keep going up and up and up [noise]\nYeah and that that's that's why I think most people are going to read this and kind of ... you know\nThey like bull yeah you're almost afraid to sell the house you have because you know the next one's going to be even more expense\nYeah whatever you're making you're putting in the next one right here moving really far out yeah and I think\nMost people are going to gravitate to that kind of opinion based on this um you know\nI mean maybe not if you live in small town America I mean my parents are from North Alabama small town things are not very expensive you know but I have not\nWent up a lot they went up a little the main ... the average household median prices went up probably you know probably normal five\nTo seven percent every ten years or whatever\nAll right so then it gets in the end of this report let's let's jump into these three factors here so you just cited one of them home price the meeting home value\nHasn't gone up and you know small town in Alabama or let's say Iowa or you know inside the heartland whatever or even rural Tennessee I mean there's a lot of places guys in a sea but what about the interest rates went up which affects your home field for developing yes [noise]\nSo yeah I think a lot of people look at this er here something like this and are like just like you said they're like no home affordability is\nIt's not there for me it's they they don't perceive it being something they can do and it then it comes back to what we're talking about before and the previous section of I've got to have twenty percent down and it's not knowing and not knowing you know it's it's\nIt can be crippling because if you base your decisions on things that are not factual\nYeah then you don't have all the ... exactly\nSo yeah it's home prices are going up you hear in that in the news and even if you're in a rural area we're home prices habit you're here and mortgage rates are going up right so you're like I Can't buy but in all actuality what this article is really speaking to is the way we look at loans and the way we look at more which is the\nDay and yes the home prices on average in most areas are going up unless you are in a rural area and yes mortgage interest rates are going up I'm no matter where you're at but the ability to qualify for a mortgage today\nHas never been better you know we did use to have you know the all the stuff to be the B and C paper the subprime stuff and that's what really led to the financial collapse you know back in two thousand six eight nine ... coming in you know the where we are now but all that stuff's been weeded out and you\nDon't want that as a mortgage product right because you're getting into a very toxic\nYou know risky loans that you can't bank and say my mortgage payments every month you know whereas now these loans are looking out for you [noise] they're making sure that you can qualify him by this house we have rules that we have to follow like ability to repay a TR\nIf you can't show that you can repay the loan you're not getting it so if we're doing our job and that's the way we were all that water stone is we'll look up front at your pay stubs your tax returns and say hey based on all this one would you credit you down payment\nThis is the house range you need to be looking at right and if you're in you're right house and the proper house range or price range\nIt's never been more affordable\nJust because of the way all the numbers come together if you try to look at this just on some teaser line that you hear on the news it's talking about home prices are up again and rates are up again and then you just let that spin out of control\nIt's going to be discouraging to you and you don't need to let it be discouraging you need to contact us and walk through it and help you with that [noise] so I guess that's kind of model preaching moment here during the radio show get preachy I got preachy but may not you know it's a passionate man\nWe like to help people it's always fun to take somebody it's never thought they could buy a house or you know you had them to where I Love it\nIt's I'm the first person ever bought a house in my in my entire family when you have those kinds of stories oh sure us like holy cow man and then when you're helping somebody gain something else in the how much really means to them yeah I mean it's it's touching it it's fun\nIt is it's very fun it is I mean we had a friend of ours by house that had like four kids and they leave the house and then when they bought this big house yeah their kids were like running around like they'd never seen some that yes in their life almost God\nHappy for them I mean it's something like you you you fully expect to watching the TV show or seen them and then when you see it play out real live right in front of you yes I mean it's a totally different feeling\nAbsolutely so when we fight and then trying to pull these things together and then you're doing all your negotiating tactic some tricks I work for you and I work for my people that's right that's right [noise]\nYou know I Want to charge back into a subject we touched on a couple of weeks ago and everyone's kind of starting to bring up the recession\nThe R word and you know again I don't want anybody to be totally freaked out about that because\nIt's a natural correction if you will um with the what the Fed's doing right now with increasing the the prime index they're they're projected to increase it other two times this year and three times next year\nThat's keeping inflation and control and you don't want inflation to be running rampant and out of control because that's just going to mess everything up from economical point of view and you know that's a thirty thousand foot overview explanation of it but\nThe fed raise in the short term interest rates via the prime index that's a good thank you that's a good healthy think so I think we are set up very nicely here in Nashville I think we're going to be isolated from a bunch of the issues but I really don't see this has been\nA a bad recession by any means it's just going to be a natural direction and leveling out of things and you and you need that in economic world so I Want to touch on that one more time and just make sure everybody was on board that and if you're not go back to the show record\nA couple of weeks ago um go out on line that ... net look all the shows up 'cause record 'em we put the videos with them and we've got tons of articles to support what we're saying and it's not\nOur personal opinion about this stuff I mean you're getting data that's coming from again first American a US News and reports you're getting stuff from Zillow you're getting stuff from\n... and stuff from court logic I mean these are the reports that the government looks at the forecast stuff so I mean it doesn't get any better than than that kind of information so that is that and real quick does anyone think that lending standards of two types you know that's you think there's two ...\nNot really no no I mean I think if you're asking the common person who by the house for the first time and they are like\nThat or they go first to sample and\nWith my money in it and they don't have any money they might say that but in general no I don't think so\nNo big deal not really that when we got a job out another break real quick but we get back to talk about a little more and we're gonna talk about if you're self employed specifically how you might have a different view on this\nOne and it might show here on TALK radio Fifteen tend to be\n\nDo to our license agreement
