{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "It's the almost everybody can so you just need the right types of experts around you to help you build those plans and that's what we do here at Grand retirement tax advisory we have the tax specialists and the financial specialist working hand in hand\nTech specialist is kind of that's kind of a of watered down where we have tax genius\nAttack again is but if you'd like to talk to our tax geniuses and our financial experts give us a call sticks on five for for one and twelve Seventy four or you can check us out at clear retirement dot com\nBut I'm number four number five here they come number for the big mistake that we're seeing again and again people come in and they think that there's a I guess in a nutshell only two places they can have their money right in the market where it's not safe or under the mattress or at the bank where it is safe\nAnd that is a pretty common misconception in the truth is is that twenty five thirty years ago that was kind of true yeah that was the market and there was the bank\nUm but today there's this entire middle ground um that has been accessible to normal people like us for about the last Fifteen Years before that it was accessible\nBy institution wrote and pensions and uh you know in ... they were using these types of tools but we didn't have access now we do and so\nUnfortunately what we're seeing is that a lot of financial advisory firms especially your big guys I won't I won't throw any names out um\nUh but you know if if their commercials on during the super bowl there one of the big guy so you know a lot of these are big financial firms they are not keeping up with these new tools as they come out and become accessible to normal people like us\nAnd in fact here in the Nashville area I only know about a two or three maybe four other advisers who are who are taking advantage of of this entire middle ground you got the stock market you got the bank you've got the insurance world\nA lot of times when people come in will draw like a a like a continuum from one being extremely conservative very low risk very low return to ten being\nSuper highly speculative vegan lose all your money in it and stuff and and we see a lot of people that are either and kind of seven or above or three or below right and we don't see a lot of in a lot of people who are in a seven and above they say well my advisor told me that this is very conservative well is very conservative\nIn the world that he's investing you enter she's invested in un but it's not conservative when it comes to the whole investment to these other tools yeah\nAnd and the truth is unfortunately is that a ... as I was saying a lot of these uh big firms these big financial firms they don't have access um they choose to not allow their representatives to have access because the level of due diligence that it takes two\nTo vet these types of investments\nFor your clients is is a little bit higher and that when you have fifty thousand representative and you're going to have a turnover of twenty percent per year you don't want to put all that extra training to somebody and so you say All right go out and build a house with a saw and a hammer right and then the advisers like well what if I Need a screwdriver\nAnd the guys upstairs say well you don't get a screwdriver you got to figure it out with us on a hammer and that's not the type of\nCarpenter you want building your financial house for your retirement right\nAnd so just make sure that whoever you work with if it's us we'd love to see you give us a call six won five for for one twelve Seventy four or check us out at clear retirement dot com um\nBut ... and that's why it's important to us that we we have our different licenses\nBecause a lot of times certain licence will allow you to to use a certain tool and but you have to have a different license to use this other tool rice and without them without having someone who has a broad array of those licenses you know where we have our insurance we ever seven we ever sixty five license sixty\nSix license were ... so we are required to to have this responsibility in these liabilities to be able to talk about these products and these solutions\nBy talked to someone who has all that then you have a much broader array of answers to your question yeah\nYeah so don't don't be fooled there are places other than the stock market and under the cushion of your bed but both of those have a place they do and that is true in in most portfolios need\nMaybe not under the ... not having a little bit of\nMoney under the mattress well at least in the bank you know your emergency funds very important but you know it just about everyone\nBelongs a little bit in each bucket stock market bucket the middle ground bucket the safe pocket they everybody belongs a little bit in each um and everybody is different though and if you don't work with somebody who has access to all of the different tools right\nThen they're not going to be able to put together the perfect plan for you because they don't have everything at their at their fingertips\nAllocate money to some place if you don't have access\nTo the right to to just be careful don't let anybody for you and say well the stock market's the only place to put your money there's other places are depending on your your risk tolerance depending on what your objectives are\nUm there's a lot of other options out there so consider working with an independent advisor or who's taking advantage of these tools for their clients I'm a rather than a big guy but ... you know it's just not us or for one twelve Seventy four\nAnd the website again is clear retirement dot\nCom I think it's always a kind of funny ... I'm sure you've seen this people come in and they bring their ... tax returns from the last few years and we'll look over them and we'll say yeah this I think you're sitting pretty good right now\nAnd this is something you might wanna think about the future but I think right now you're doing OK and people kind of look at us like wait a second aren't you supposed to try to talk me into why this is terrible so that I'll do business with you right now we're just not how will tell you what we really we see a problem will definitely tell you about it you know what we consider to be a better option\nI think ... I had a meeting with a client the other day who this guy has maybe to\nTwo other advisers that they have some money with 'em and uh they brought in one of the portfolios for one of the other advisors and left it with me and I did some diagnostics and I gave it back to them and I said I ...\nI Would just keep that where it is it looked good of you but I mean a ... a hearing granite retirement and tax advisory we don't we don't charge for our time we don't charge for meetings\nUm you know if a client becomes a client that's how we make our revenue but we're not going to charge a client to come in and talk\nBecause we want to make sure one that we don't create any boundaries between our clients and ourselves um to to because I don't want simple questions to go on ask because I don't have they're worried about a bill or something like that right so so we don't do that so when we have clients come in for their second opinion ... will spend an hour hour and a half together\nAnd look over portfolio ask about goals and uh and you know it's like I said with that client that came in and brought that portfolio will be the first ones to tell ya\nBased off of what you've explained to me are trying to accomplish race based off of what you explained to me your risk tolerance isn't based off of what you explained to me your goals are your either perfect where you are now\nOr here's what we could tweak can change that would get you towards those goals and objectives faster or or better right and that's what the second opinion is about so give us a call if you haven't had a second opinion in in the recent past we'd love to spend an hour with you and won't cost\nHills out for or vote ... on his and build your ... the people on the cat out and play your retirement and ... and all that for the\nYou still gained twelve thousand dollars in that same three thousand dollar house so you got a difference of six grand less but yet you haven't appreciated you've actually just slowed your appreciation rates so that's what they're referring to when they're saying\nPrices of softening or I'm falling on prices will the falling from my appreciation of six percent five percent of the four percent but they're not going into the negative are plummeting you know no no\nWell from the old Chris Corvette midtown title he was going to look of knowledge here I'm going to say is that really depends on what price point you're looking at OK with the ... for the average consumer who's buying two hundred and fifty thousand or maybe less it let's just go less than three hundred thousand which is the average price in ... in Nashville\nThose houses I Do not see any ...\nOut of reduction in price the absolutely knowing time because it's it's if anything is more competitive than ever because there's only so many of those houses available and with writes kind of kind of being a little balls are right now it's it's push people a lot more people into that project maybe if it's double that and as a six hundred thousand dollar house yeah maybe you see a little more softening\nIn there and a one percent could be a to B a drastic number depending on what the price of that houses but it just I think a lot of it depends on what type of house you're looking at in where the houses located out so there's so many factors that go into that other than saying house prices are just softening\nYeah and and the one key thing to take out of all of this is if you get sucked into an article or you're hearing something on the news if you don't hear the word depreciation if you don't hear them actually say or read in the print depreciation then\nHouse house fires are not following they're just trying to grab some attention freak you out draw un by saying oh houses house prices are
