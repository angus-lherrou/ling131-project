honoring me with this and I appreciate the honor I think uh but there's a couple of things that are going to go along with me agreeing to be your executor\nUm otherwise I Can't be your exact number one is I have to know what every detail of your situation is\nAnd that includes reading the wheel and understanding the wheel and going over it with your lawyer number two is all of those affected by

appreciate that's how I was feeling as well ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge and say I refuse it\nI'm not going to take it I told him while he's alive I'm not going to do it and I'm not going to do it every day I don't get built into it\nOkay thanks for the call open phones a AAA eight to five five to to

I'm nursing you'd do I'd I'd actually seeing little pieces of some of the talk and you kind of shit together in a different way and book ended it with some stories and open shorter closing story that\nHad everybody in the audience crying knock rod commercials so I'm an I'm an easy target right but uh I'm a ... a crowd and everything but then you and me ball on out there it was ... but a powerful story about your talk was about overcoming fear yeah a great ...\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really important topic and I've I've really taught on this topic for years of Business Week because it's the number one barrier to why women don't go for it why they don't change their dream or use their talents or start that business or a or you know try something new it's really fear that hold them back and see if I could help them\nGet to the fear and through the fear that I can give them all the help and business that they need but when we started dreaming up smart conference title nice balance for years\nNot okay let's keep it fresh let's do something new and I generally Jeremy ... you know my leader and myself we're talking how can we apply this content that audience and really realize that it's so easy because everyone deals with fear whether it's in your marriage or or in your relationships your career and so I worked hard to take that talk and adapt it for this audience um ... I was really happy with how it\nTurned out it was really really strong ring of stuff\nSo much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a bargain commercial break a couple of commercials where it goes by the content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I even heard her talk\nAnd they had you know that element of overcoming fear because I think there's so much\nWe talk about transforming around here a lot of transformation transfer forming and getting yourself out of debt transforming your marriage outlets parrot talks about that ritual and less with marriage and money a van or a you know Anthony with transforming with your teenagers you ladies in business and\nEvery time there's transformation as a possibility failures possibility in fear kicked kicks in\nIt doesn't that voice in your head gets really loud\nAnd it starts to even sound rational and you start to make make excuses that really make you make a lot of sense and you stay stuck but if you have someone that can speak into your life whether it's a mentor a friend a spouse that says you can do this and here's how when you lay out the path which we've been talking about that even just today that's what\nA you know ran the solution is so great at getting people to plan whether it's with their money or their business and so on\n'em they loved that quote from the tri athletes should don't listen to your self talk to your show yeah it is listening to yourself to start telling yourself the way it's going to be attacked and even how he describes and he's just so funny what you're talking to him when\nI listen to some odd years fearing doubt and worried but when I talked to myself I can tell myself anything I Want to and it that simple as you can tell myself into something\nSo today it's hear your new project is here I was little so book is cool this way on even given anybody I Know I mean no one knows so this is like big time announcement right now are holding my hand the business boutique\nTwenty Nineteen gold plan or your personal guide to getting results and this thing is chock full with a step by step process to change your life talk about putting this together and what's in this go\nPlanter well when I introduced it to our team a few weeks ago really the best way that I can explain that there are different things that I use my own personal life to grow and to improve and reach my goals I read books to grow I Will use work books if I'm doing a devotion or Bible study I have to do list and I use a journal to write down goals than a calendar and a calendar\nHow can we pull all these pieces together into a planner that connect those dots so for example in January we set goals and then we talk about what we actually uh put those on the counter then we put them on the task glass and you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and the way that bill today was like I Would have coaching session so I have questions in there for reflection and activities to work through so if I was sitting down with you over coffee these the questions I Would ask you to help you get to where you want to be so it's really fun and then every single month\nHas a different topic in teaching\nTo help you grow and this is kind of a like a compliment to business boutique book it's almost like a workbook\nThat helps you put it into a ... a month of August is taking care of you know and then you've got questions when they're when do you feel your best what activates would activities give you energy and bringing joy and what things make you like yourself the ...\nWas perfect for your furniture building business okay ray\n... million that's awesome first of all I Love how you introduce yourself you said I'm a young entrepreneur and right there that mindset\nIs already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in a space that just screams confidence and I love that\nI Will tell you one of the great things a million I see that's a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on that this is something that you could have a side business\nAnd start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills but then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be\nYour full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started his little T shirt business Dave and college little T shirt business that was a multi million dollar business before he ever graduated and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage him\nThe idea that it's difficult to get into space because you're a girl I think\nIs more in your head in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy him if you solve problems for people if you had a great product and you take care of the marketplace they don't really care if it was you or do someone old someone young they just love the furniture I Am\nI'm an older doesn't buy furniture but my wife would do a decorator and I can just tell you either my wife or I were we buying a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand that advantage 'cause we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah I think a million that you this does it have to be a barrier for you if you want to get so I think it's an advantage just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you sell that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust get started dip you're telling the water and million will make sure that Kelly since my book and you can follow that plan it's a step by step plan to grow this business\nAnd start small start in the ... side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like Dave said you'll start to see it as an advantage that you offer the marketplace through your business that excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call girl you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nSo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke a shown a book about money\nThat's kind of a disadvantage inner\nWho would want to read them money book from a guy that went broke that is what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks I kinda figured out everybody wants to buy among the book from a guy who went broke and learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity\nThat felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brand differentiate her because I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirt you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch\nOn the furniture um and you're going to put a a different kind of\nLook different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture really cool you know it makes you stand out I Love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures with you with your power tools and yeah do you get in there and what the big ... or whatever\nAnd safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy insecurity\nI saw was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show",
