kid that won the mortgage and then the second being our car ... and and what happened in white\nAnd feel that that money should go towards the car and I am just\nMeaning it as a little bit more sentimental and wanting it could go toward something a little bit more sentimental and I'm Wondering is that correct it kind of you that money as kind of like a final Gaskins ... kind of take away the emotions can just go towards fat\nSo you want to buy something with it\nWell yes like I'm eating a new as as sweet as and appliances on mine and it's kind of been around for way too long and it was hardly working in the first place so and my grandmother and when that taught me how to cut fell ... for me that would be kind of a more final gift\nI guess I Would say that my husband is like half we have the extra money toward a car I get that pay down\nOkay how much money's involved\nAt just under nine grand right\nUm\nWell I analyze these things through the sentimental limbs as well and uh the way I Would ask myself this is okay grandma was obviously good with their money\nIs is that she left her grandkid and kids nine thousand bucks okay mhm um show grandma sitting in heaven looking at a grandbaby what makes her smile because her granddaughter did this with the money then I'm not thinking a dishwasher does that\n[laughter]\nNow I get the tie into she taught you to cook mhm I might take a thousand dollars and buy some cooking utensils so that every time I use that set of\nPots and pans or knives or whatever that I thought a grandma and I'm like what the rest of it on my car but I think grandma probably with somebody that hated debt and she might be smiling if you pay it off the debt I gotta agree with your husband\nOkay um but it's not that I'm not doing that through the lens of I'm calling your sentiments silly\nI'm just laying so I'm I'm just saying you're sentiment you can actually use that to try to say okay this is a you know the the character of this woman she was a frugal person of saving person she was careful with their money my guess is she hated debt\n... does that sound familiar I mean\n[noise] [noise] oh yeah fear fail they paid off all that lounge real estate and made it pretty much as their retirement\nYeah so I mean I think she'd be smiling it'd be paid off your car but also think should be smiling if you've spent you know a grand on some stuff to using the kitchen I get to enlist balances out a little bit how much do you own a car\nAt sea we come back I think twenty four twenty five thousand dollars to the ... what's your household they wouldn't pay it off they just get what's your household income\n[noise] uh right under ... ... the year\nOkay All right well it's all going to get taken care of British in any way so more than anything it's just an emotional discussion I don't I mean yeah as long as you don't um\nWell the ... or you know what what would Dave ensuring Ramsey do we would look at it through the lens of what what is was and that would also be pleasing to grandma and so I probably would buy you know I'd probably say share and let's go get a really high end amazing set of\nCooking pots and pans knobs or whatever drop a grand on it I don't know something like that uh-huh and then let's throw the rest of it is in honor of grandmother because I think she'd be smiling about both things\nI think you're you know you're honoring life or tradition the way she\nYou do whatever you want there that's just the way I think through it\nThis was that ever in your show\nHave dreams and plans and the only real

that's one dental dot com [noise]\nI Am this is talk radio Ninety eight forty three and then\nRamsey solutions\nHill is with us Hi Elle how are you today and I'm good how are you doing that is\nDo I live here in Nashville I'm originally from Kansas so okay well welcome to the inner ear to do that for ... yes I Am loving it much will be paid off I paid off sixty thousand good and how long did this take it took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time I started out at fifty thousand and then I'm\nIn the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end of my baby step to sell what do you do for a living\nI'm an accountant I'm a CPA go watch a second job\nSo I kind of just at a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the story of rubble will target trouble yeah target gets me in trouble back I Would draw yeah\nWhat kind of that was the sixty thousand it was all student loans or what's your degree in\nSo all accounting I got my undergrad and master's degree\nIn accounting degree which obviously such a recipient yes okay actual actual excellent so whatever three years he goes on when you go to school yes\nSo I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling with your financial aid\nAnd as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that final number was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I owed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than my one year's salary and so I saw that and I sold my monthly payment and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting\nSo I knew the interest was going to add up quickly now and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that's the route I was going to take\nPoker show were journal both register for him\nSo I actually listen to the Dave Ramsey show when I was like in junior high and high school age and\nYour net will kind of\nUm so my dad is a farmer in Kansas and in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and all you have out in the fields is the radio I didn't even have a cell phone back then and so um you know I Would listen to ask him radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about a man and I could switch to a and listening to talk radio so um you know I listen to us in in the morning and then I switched to the Dave Ramsey show from one to four nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switch back to us and so it was just a nice nice little break in the day\nI have a strange movie version though combine yes which I don't know how your tuning in the rodeos you're out here ah getting getting some a picture of it yesterday was that we yes\nMy dad's a wheat farmer so yeah we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work to feel young girl that combined by yourself I Would probably say like twelve or Thirteen million something like that yeah and I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so um yeah\nYou are a lot of work do you have to grow up on a formula or not or yes you are not a drop early [laughter] very cool orange so you this was drilled in your head become over counting you get the degree you look up to what we're doing so might be steps I got her ... from the radio then what happened\nAnd uh well I just jumped right into it I so I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then\nI jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motorcycle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum wage and um and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working your plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency fund in place and that was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me it made this terrible situation that I was in um so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I followed the plan and how that set aside you know it's very important\nTo many vehicles in the store called ... I had no remote exactly good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this it feels amazing it's it's the best feeling in the world to older I'm twenty eight twenty another one of these rock star millennials are all the time very well done\nVery cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff\nYes I did I talked about the plan constantly I was probably annoying throughout the process just talking about Dave Ramsey [laughter] but yes I've everyone kind of been in on the loop job who is your biggest cheerleader and probably my sisters\nI have two older sisters and they are also working the plan and they're working on paying off their student loans right now so now I'm like they see me pay them off and you know there'll be next so you know we kind of true to each other on throughout the process\nUm he ends up paying everything\nHe absolutely ended up paying everything whenever they're divorced like he was making about a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year and a\nWide as you know like that now\nWe went through the flight and truth out and they can\nAnd we he lost his job I lost my job um and so he's got it back in ... it gotten back to working at like he had to go with a different company and they offered him five dollars an hour ...\nOne of the other company never reopened right and what does he do\nHe works um he trader and the plant here\nIn Louisiana okay ... work in a new\nOutlook partly other part of the story I Want to get straight in my head it sounded like you didn't know how much daddy had until after you were engaged\nYeah why I I was not aware I was not very smart and I pointed out that that I've never had been crossed my mind\nWas should across is\n\nThat you should have had this information prior to a making a commitment to marriage\nYeah that's kind of a problem like he was hiding it oh and that bothers me more than the debt right this moment um and so what's his attitude about the debt\nUm he really I haven't been paying anything like that I I just don't want to start married now that I Know about the guy that I can accept that I guess before we actually set a date to get married I white now that we are on a plan to get paid off\nThere you go and that he believes in that plan and is committed fully to that plan I mean the line if he is for whatever reason\nHas has given up hope and it feels like he's stuck you're just going to stay there or he just doesn't care or whatever about the debt if for whatever reason he's just gonna Waller when this that's a deal breaker\nOkay it's not that\nI wouldn't tell you the not marry him over the debt but I Would tell you to not marry him over lying about it or not marry him over uh the fact that he wants to just stay in it because you're not going to be you know you you it's a long life will help for you\nOkay if you think about ten years Fifteen Years from now you're still wall and the stuff you're not going to be okay with that\nYeah that's what I absolutely don't want to do yeah\nAnd so it was ... you know and if he's not going to be all in like we live on nothing and I'm you know he probably go back to court and are just some stuff\nAnd um\nAnd I don't think he owes forty five thousand dollars on the ... I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they report it you\nKnow I'll leave out and he I Would like rape artists Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving and then like I think it absolutely outrageous\nA young any Roald some negative equity into that to get the\n...\nAnd so the the forty five thousand is the difference okay they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar really probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] wow a you might be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you're going to put some money together here and that means both of you are going to get your incomes up and you both have to have like I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you just go bananas it's going to take you a few years\nSo um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in debt when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not going to last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nJust what you're going to get divorced I mean there's uses a fairly simple equation here\nAnd so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not a keeper I don't know if he's a keeper not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers and all that but as he got his way up\nBut um anyway man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] off a lot of four that's good\nGosh so oh wow yeah somebody\nSo anyway yeah ... this was not an equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that's behind us now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go game all that's fine thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex our you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] very good hey we are newly married and looking to create a plan forward good or otherwise so yep newly a newly came onto your videos on YouTube so I'm as I'm going through it looks like we are on step there were a free we of six months of a savings\nBoth put about Fifteen to Seventeen percent into four one K. wow a new\nOne out or ... or a plan that you've already done all of it [laughter] yeah it doesn't happen all the time really really good for you okay so what's your question\nUm yeah no kidding oh college fund so it's kind of like Ron step six an hour of about fifty yeah mortgages are only to okay [laughter]\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra on savings on top of our six month emergency fund programs for the question is a story about forty on the house is worth about a hundred mhm um and it's an a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen Fifteen extra grand do we use that to start paying off the mortgage more uh right now I Do double payments so we're already actively trying to pay that off quicker but do we\nWe commit to paying off house early or do we split it and keep keep doing the uh paying down the mortgage and poking up for a um a down payment knowing that one too\nI Love real estate and if you have a desire to own real real estate I really want you to get there I Do not personally buy\nReal estate was that for investment and I don't tell people to find some real

production value eventually because I'd like to become fully employed screwed adventure mhm um but actually curious what your thoughts were on taking that money that I earned out of my business and not\nApplying it to our debt\nBut to apply it back to the business itself\nUm how much are you making and what do you belong how much you're blowing back in\nUm honestly I really don't make a whole

dollars a month not to exceed\nYou know and I are are forty percent of my prophet not to uh you know some some kind of a percentage or an end or money amount that at some point you start making money

having a very hard time trying to get on track\nWith everything including starting our emergency fund\nWhat can we do when we are so behind that we can not even catch up for about two months behind on all bills is causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt in so deep that we can't get out\nYeah just saying I gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that and I'm part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um\nLet's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second or two months behind on our bills and it's causing us so much stress on their marriage and kids being behind on your bill should not affect your kids\nShould know about it you don't need to tell your five year old you're behind on the lights that's not their problem much your problem\nAnd you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give a little big long reason why those a complete sentence [noise] no but don't pass off the uh you know don't pass off the stress that the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely overwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck I've been there somebody you don't know what I'm Talking about you been there to do\nIt is no fun OK here's how you fix it\nYou have to begin to take control of what you can take control of you have an income let's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget\nNow you do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is is you're telling the money that you do have where it is going to go and so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up in one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can\n\nSo you prioritize you make enough to buy food you do not make enough to eat out so we're not going to restaurants but we are going to the grocery store and we're going to feed our family and we're going to cook from scratch 'cause it's healthier in ...\nSo there we go but you make enough to do that check that one down for the food budget downright that number down and you can do that you make enough to pay your lights and water and if you're behind on them you catch them all up this month\nBefore you do anything else after you ate ... current on your lights get current on your water now if you have a six hundred dollar a month cable bill because you have an F. L. super duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that crap but I'm Talking about water and the lights\nAnd gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on\nAnd gas to heat if it's gas heat\nOkay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now number three a shelter\nNow you pay your rent it doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there's no heat so you've got to put heat and the place okay so\nYou pay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number for you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nYour current on the car and you keep gash in the car now if that takes all your money and you can pay nothing else this month oh well\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now you're dead free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to\nGet so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right\nYeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty about fifty about fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay uh well we're going to put fourteen thousand an emergency fund\nOkay so now you have an emergency fund you put ten thousand with the land you get a construction alone with the takeout loan a permanent takeout\nAnd your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the house okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nDoes that make sense huh so that means you're building up two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house\nNow you're at three sixty and you don't have twenty percent down anymore okay you see how that works\nSo you're getting on trucks and loan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage good called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction alone and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you can go in lock in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage ... picking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you haven't ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to golf or Joe mortgage a it is taking up and I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights in\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago I Would look them in period\nWe are in a rising interest rate environment nothing to panic about but it is going up and so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible ray you can get your hands on for refinance were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by locking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rates come back down dramatically\nUm you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve months they're probably going to go up and so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends\nUm then then I'm going to lock everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage today and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray how're you doing better\nThan I deserve what's up\nWe are a month and a half away from me and gotten a baby that shoe good and um yeah he said in fact I don't want to live that momentum that we've had kept\nGoing toward that mhm and and going into baby step three there's like a few of\n'em that are happening so we want to August ... babysat three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school to get a bachelor's they had a better paying job\nThat would be a baby step three\nOkay Rebecca my question we also want to start a family but we need competitors like baby fine because we want to cash flow

start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you guys got health insurance you know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund in place and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me your work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah labor and delivery\nNo matter how that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during the nine much\nOkay yeah\nSo you could just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you decide well we're now we're saving for that and and and you know anything you want to do that's an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency him going back to goes on emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency you can cover it\nIt's a luxury to have that as an extra savings or maybe came on the way writes
