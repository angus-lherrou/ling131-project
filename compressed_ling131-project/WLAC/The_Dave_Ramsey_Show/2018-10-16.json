long did this take a Eighteen month good for you and your range of income during that time\nUm during that time we started at about one twenty and we had kind of a temporary increase to about one fifty five to one fixed ... but then will kind of go back down to one twenty five\nOkay what are you guys do for a living\nI'm I'm a stay at home home schooling mom and I am a a\nContractor working overseas okay what do you do well I primarily a work as an aircraft mechanic an inspector o ... thing in a non destructive inspection\nGotcha okay and so what kind of ... was the anyone tiles\nI'm most like credit card and then we had a car I'm a tractor and then he vacation time share\nOh goody you guys are a little bit of everything going on and how long have you been married\nI'm Twenty one years now what happened to Eighteen months ago\n[noise] um well\nI had a because my work is kind of cyclical I work about sixty days on sixty days off overseas\nI for a long time had or for the first couple of years of my employment I had the opportunity to do extensions\n... and we use\nThose extensions which kind of worked out like all the time and kind of cover expenses and make things and all that and then a few months ago I was told that we wouldn't be getting any more extensions\nSo I was I was overseas with time and Mary where I couldn't really call stuff I had to do everything by text to my texted her and said here's what it's looking like which are understandably we we were doing things uh upset her quite a bit\nYeah your income rate dropped in half\nA yeah yeah just took a big hit to the income there and she was pretty upset about that so we were considering cashing out my four one K. to pay things off and to kind of make herself hold again [laughter]\nAnd then what happened at that point is when we got gotten texting that night I'm like\nYou've got very upset I started looking into four one K. option I didn't like that option because we've already in our past Twenty years cashed in a couple of my small retirements when I quit a job\nAnd so I called my brother at like eleven o'clock at night he works nights so I can talk to him and I called my brother Charlie and he kind of rip to me is what\nThey ran to the navy I\nSaid that you know we make too much money can be that broke and he told me that we you know if we can sell this or that and you start talking about selling the car and selling the tractor and selling the trap getting\nThe van and I kind of came up with excuses for every one and it wasn't really listening very well and hung up liking here is just crying and\nTried to go to sleep and ended up getting out at a bad ah went into my office got on the computer and started making a spreadsheet and I sat down in the first thing I looked at with the car um it was the only vehicle we in the tractor that we owe money on stale\n... um we had my mini van was paid off um had in my power which are like a thousand miles uh\nWhat was it worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we I think one of the votes can be solved\nWas quite a while yeah you're you're ... oh\nYeah and they were offering you know we can do that by Dr ... and we were paying the pet but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the back and got the cash settlement got rid of the tank and the position that would say that it actually had it at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nI'm we see the pipelines are being built an wars opened up um we've spent three billion three and a half billion on the new law we need the full funding you're right the twenty five million a but\nWe're making the progress to originalist on the Supreme Court break judges on the lower courts\nAnd I I just see in America that's transforming before our eyes based on every measure consumer confidence everything in between uh yeah I Wish they would have worked faster they would have kept their promises better does do a lot of work to do but the alternative is nonexistent\nThere is no alternative if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi in the house vote for Democrats for the Senate you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nUm that's it if you you know you save the house and Senate we can get a lot done we get these additional seats in Indiana North Dakota Montana if we ... you don't hold in Nevada and we pick up with Martha mix Sally in Arizona\nI mean and we Claire McCaskill gets sent packing and Rick Scott wins in Florida it would be amazing holding the house is key if it even if you don't particularly love you Republican congressmen it's not going to be an impeachment investigation vote that the Democrat is offering you\nSo for that reason alone I mean it's important to me will survive but I'm not saying we wouldn't not going to come on here the day after election day whining complain I'm gonna just dig my hills in and do what I always do after elections and let's fight for what I Believe in\nWhat we'd be so much easier if we just did it on election day anyway I appreciate your call I'm Dana is in Oklahoma Dana Hi how are you\nSeeing where

keep it really sure I'm back in February all started school tried to\nGo and vote on over there and started looking into your show\nUm my grandma offered to take over my finances for me so I turned over my dog ate away all of my extra cash she said she would apply to toward small school tuition\nHow old are you I'm twenty\nOne and you need your grandmother to handle your finances\nOh she off and it sounded like a good deal\nFor the title Romano wouldn't let her\nWhy why do we deal for somebody else to handle your money\nOld and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to

be picked up\nBut here's the thing the only way if someone opens on account and your name the only way to get that account cleared other than pay it yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that as you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who stole your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the fish\nIt's my grandmother and I'm I'm surprised that actually that they went and picked her up but they did and uh you know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal an identity and so um\nShe she's in trouble [noise] she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name right but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but um\nThose moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a sad thing though what a horrible thing you guys are going through now Cody um we're much how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nOf forty thousand a year\nOkay

I was leaving Amish what my friends told me and my sister lost her husband and the state within often and so she\nHad two little babies and there was nothing that I could do to help her ...\nAnd I hated that yeah so um I wrote to you and you've sent her to ... oh wow and I have to go as her family unit oh neat so um we both got out of ... she knew what to do after that and I finished up my debt mhm\nThe problem was once I got out of debt I\nI didn't get into more debt I tell people I fell off the wagon Iran along behind it\n[laughter] well you go yeah I see what you're saying I think that act like how she doing she's doing great good how many years ago was that a well her daughter's in college now and they were babies they were babies ... what Fifteen Twenty years ago into him while\nHe's while good so how we got married several years after that and I have a long commute to work so I started listening to your ... and sort of began to say to see where I went wrong\nMhm and we watched one of your um I bought something here and I've got a free download so we watched it one night I was a little apprehensive about that because my first marriage had some issues in this area mhm\nAnd at the end of that he looked at me and he said how long would it take ... and I fell in love with him all over again [laughter] so we gave up everything that ... west ... essential and\nFor sixteen whole Mars sixteen homeland well now it's all done I mean ... like you guys are an awesome straight yeah it's it's a way better feeling you're sitting\nThere with the two hundred thousand dollar income paid for property everywhere life is good on your planet in his very now he's just I mean you're gonna you're you're on a trajectory is gonna be incredible\nAnd you'll never be in a position again of somebody you love needs help you can't help but I Know you're there now this is amazing wow well good for you or a great story I Love it all up the habit and the pictures I flashed up on the\nGrade you can go there anytime they\nSure are usually [laughter] well it\nProbably slaves good since it's paid for and they get so what do you tell people the key was because there's a lot of heart in your story ... I'm a motion in your throat when you're telling that story for sure\nIt's hard to get it out actually um [noise]\nYou know life is about choice it's God gave us free will and and which you choose to do what what you want to do and so it's a choice it's we we chose to do this ... and we sometimes chose it more than once a day [laughter]\nBut the key would be to choose it I think you would say the budget you have a plan ever plan and find your content in in that yeah\nIf they're not that so that's something else we we we have a car at all I Know I'm an out for a place and so the the car I'm thinking about sounds kind of a toy car I've had so few years and you know as much as I like it I'm thinking oh\nWhat's ... what's the what's the car that you need to replace [noise]\nSo the the car need that I Will need or a place of the ... it's a good reliable but I Know that no actually the miles of getting up there\nOne of the normal normal but why can't you just save up between now and the time you replace the car and much longer you gonna drive the Hyundai for you replace it\nAll depends on how long it lasted about a hundred and Eighteen thousand miles\nBottle how long were you drive the Hyundai before you replace it\nProbably three to five years\nTo save up a car price between now and then\nI think I could yes\nOkay then you don't have to sell the toy car for that the only question is do you want to keep the toy car or do you want to keep the brokerage account because one of them needs to go so you can have an emergency fund\nYeah yeah which one do you want to know I guess the\nThe second clip on a brokerage account most with long term so I think if I sell it it's just a matter of you know it'd be additional income to my salary of the year that\n\nEven now that we don't have any basis in that stock\nAgain no I don't know why\nYou didn't pay anything do I\nKnow I'm Sorry yes I have a basis in there so there's there's that I'm as far as taxes go it on the capital gains\nTerm exactly which one would you rather have a car with a brokerage account because one of them needs to sell when you decide that you'll know which one to sell and you'll know how to send your emergency fund and keep the other one but now says with us in San Diego Hi Vanessa how are you\nGave him gain great how are you know\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm I just wanted to do that a bit of help on where to start um I'm looking to start as I did actually two full time business\nI Am a Lion King she tried to um I had been mean and it takes you right at the grey hairs and I'm already I'm going to copy the book\nYeah I had that that child works wandered in the car yeah and I and I'm looking to move forward on my idea I have a business plan that had it out that few years back now I'm trying to move forward should on my plan and a sports camp I'm my\nQuestion is how do I start where do I go up my probably make me permit for local park um I have ideas have asked you lie in a theater ... it's basically I practice in\nA baseball or Pakistan batch about somebody need location it's not just a plain park out Neal\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff um a lot of wise to do that with personal trainers and in a sense this is a\nType of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal dumping\nOkay I I Would I I just want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the why\nNow I was there that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you're going to get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nI but I and they may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to live for right now but that'll get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this and you know you can you can start there if you want if you got the money if you got a little bit of cash\nNow I now I'm starting from scratch and you know basically a plan that I had gotten in that dream stage for the longest time and now that I've had the book and I they can get quite catch them empowered I'm ... ... you know where to go hat in art\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is you take that cash\nAnd that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis but right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't wanna do that\nSee that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else's roof a little bit and then\nThen when we got a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day for a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients a write off the bat\nAh when I started financial piece University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had to book it and you couldn't just keep it book you had to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you see it as a meeting and he'll like a hundred and thirty people is a nice size little conference room and all of meeting room kind of thing tables moved round and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room\nAnd I'm pretty cool if you think about it and so but I had to just look at as a part of renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at in another evening than a bucket of another evening and then I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I start paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that for people came\nFor a short period of time to get rid of the ... a lot faster and you know two two and a half years you can do that but you guys are gonna be working twenty four seven to do that with the numbers are given me and you\nCan do it though the teachers do it all the time bill is with us in Nashville Hi Bill how are you\nA hey thank you I'm Kate we got an upside down car um we owe Thirteen thousand dollars on a car it's a book values seven thousand but unfortunately we've got a seven thousand dollar a maintenance bill a silly thing we have to pay to get it up a even being more about what\nJust asking what the heck makes sense to do with his car\nThat doesn't make sense of what what kind of seven thousand dollar car has a seven thousand dollar maintenance bill\nIt's a two thousand and five BMW six forty five\nAnd what's wrong with it for God's sakes\nIt's got an engine seal up on that cost about seven to get fixed\nOkay but if it's worth seven thousand dollars and it takes seven thousand dollars to fix it that means it's not worth anything that's why there's got to be an alternative way to get this thing fixture you dealing with the dealer\nOr know dealing with a mechanic to specialize in the ...\nYeah and that's a that's a ridiculous you can't spend seven thousand I mean you're better off to just turn in the shower\nI Would think the caller I think the car would probably bring a couple of grand even with the shape it's in but you owe Thirteen on it so basically you're Thirteen thousand or credit card debt is what you have that's right that's attached to a car so what's your household income\nA almost a hundred\nOkay yeah I'm just gonna trade like Thirteen thousand dollar a credit card debt I guess a car sits in the driveway um the ... other transportation um who do you owe them money to\nUm\nTo the car I guess cars USA so it's our bank I'm a veteran [noise]\nOkay I Will go out to the usa might actually work with you and let you sign an an secured note\nFor the balance of what it doesn't bring at least that way you can get the tags and the insurance and stuff off of you and you know ... for a couple of ground salvage and then you got a loving thousand dollars you just got an an secured note because you bought a home you bought a piece of garbage apparently oh my gosh I'm so sorry that's why I ... I hate\nThat that you're saying exactly what my wife said come on\nI'm Sorry [laughter] you already knew it [laughter] it's just oh and I'm being usually beamer seven six series are pretty good cars\nI'm really shocked and can't find something to do to get that thing patched together cheaper than that I'm going to go back on your mechanic in or um maybe get a second opinion from another independent\nBeamer a mechanic\nOr and or pushback on this guy and go listen there's no possible way we're spending seven grand on a car there's a book about seven grant\nSo you got any other ideas man [laughter] as you're getting this job [laughter] see see if he's got something else he can do I don't know I mean the fuel systems are finicky I Know that I've had a couple of them\nAnd generally they're great cars I'm I'm a beamer fan regiment once than about ... ... on the other day is really a nice car\nBut um yeah uh uh now I\nI'm just going to push back get a second opinion pushback on this guy I work with usa and then say I'll make a hundred grand I got eleven thousand dollars worth of worst case like I live in thousand dollar\nA credit card debt here I just got to pay off how fast can I pay it off and you don't get the title back then sell it for salvage if if USA I won't work with you and do it on an secured loan basis transfer that negative equity and they went on secured loan but\nUh hopefully you can figure out where to put a couple of grand in it and then if it's worth a global brand salvage been two more on like having four in it\nAnd it would sell for seven then if you can figure that out that would be a lot better use of the situation but\nNo way you spent seven thousand dollars on a car or seven thousand dollars a myth that doesn't the math done more\nI'm Sorry that was so frustrating when you get these things man you just want to take a gun outside for shooting the stupid thing\nIt makes you laugh\nThis is talk radio Ninety eight three hands Fifteen ten W.
