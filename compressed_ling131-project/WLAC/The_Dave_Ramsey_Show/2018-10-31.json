just sets that that's what we're going to do 'cause moving is more disruptive than that\n[noise] play and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man or thinking of going it's more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\n[noise] we had to basically tripling the size of the home now you know\nUh so you're going to end up mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage of maybe I think we're going to end up somewhere in the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... says about fifty five six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from\n... last year\nLast year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay well you got to worry about her income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage is almost like you're building a house correct\nAnd you can email you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage or the payment is no more than a force of your take on pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that uh I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project and you're living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... the four thousand square foot addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house to\nGender is one of those in tech cannot Hi ginger how are you\nGetting right good how can I\nI don't want to know my husband and I we have work constantly are ... ... and we have finally paid off our market share all of our cars everything everything we own our\nGreat we have so much um\nWe're still working that way are we have buried trying our security ... are a ... a year and me I'm a full year how my mhm and I couldn't tell me hey I'll wake up and say well now last night we had been say all that and\nThat type ... last night I get hit by we had been putting\nOur income that we weren't at ... living off of the security okay my question to you and when our retirement or one are fighting\nA that we eat out mhm and what I Do think it was a ... year when our income on security\nWhat when he got much retiring at the end up next year\nYou know how old are you ... how old are you I'm sixty six seven okay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay and the one we had a hundred and twenty thousand and our next egg should we have a lot at another country out mhm\nOkay that's two hundred and twenty thousand in a dish round numbers I mean if you made a ten percent on that between two thousand dollars a year\nOkay okay I figured\nYou know and so if you're in van and we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too\nThat um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly uh I mean you you have\nA few thousand dollars a month to live on but I mean you've got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money is what we're talking about here\nAnd I'm ... and\nPlus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to but a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring in luxury uh but you should have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off so that's good\nUm I Love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you can work a little bit more in lock out that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not\nSet up a thing where I'm draining down that two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now because that's there's an end to that game called hunger and I don't want to get there\nYou don't want to destroy this goose so you just live off the gold and eggs on like so whatever you know you sit down with your investment professional if you don't have one sit down with one of our smart vest her prose and talk about investing this two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you do that creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security\nAnd if you can do that then you're in a position to do it\nAnd um but again it's not going to be um a a a\nA luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and\nUh you know and that kind of stuff on this income um but but but\nI think you can do it it just a matter are you willing to live that frugally and put your\nBudget together and say these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then again

money do you have a ...\nWell I have basically ... the two pensions which I say it would be about forty thousand I have about\nA hundred and twenty thousand in a rental property that's equity mhm oh I have about fifty thousand in a ... ...\nHow much do you own your mortgage\nI owe about sixty thousand all my primary residence which is also the fall and when she's probably as a two hundred thousand plus barrier\nMhm okay and what are you in in and um your your mortgage is on the rental too right\nI Do yes how much a\nLet's say two hundred and eighty thousand\nOkay so you need two hundred and sixty thousand bucks to be dead free\nYeah I'm kind of plan on selling those was kind of my thinking what if I were a a\nA little less than four you know depending on the market there's three different for different properties so\nSo ah are you married yes I Am as your wife work outside the home\nUh no she ... she has not worked for about three years she had knee surgery and then we took

you\nGot about a hundred and fifty hundred sixty thousand bucks to your name is all was paid for farm you know fifty five years old and um and you got a pension or forty grand\nYeah OK\nAnd when you die what happens to the pension and it goes away right\nUh probably we would go to my wife is she still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably 'cause I can take I couldn't take it as survivor\nAnd probably get more\nYeah but are you healthy yes I Would take it as no survivor give more by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you to better deal yeah I've always had her take all the money you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In

years is going to get old\nYou know I'm sitting there looking yet let's see uh uh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida\nAnd I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important races Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi means\nTo heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you want running your country then by all means staying home\nListen at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is we are going to rage there well you can rage away as long as it's not against\nMe I don't really care I'm going to be so mad Republicans that they don't go out and vote well I have very\nVery sad that we found ... she's already hooked on the drapes she got there's been covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nAll bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been with calls me I never get called for a poll\nAnd polls you know I look at them I Know the conventional wisdom is is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nUh but I also know that they got it wrong and two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that's why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight\nYeah because you can't tell you cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically my talking about you everybody knows you vote\nHas nothing to do with the voting I you know all we can do is informed people\nEverything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with everybody my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part\nNow we know we're in a blue state so we do the best we\nCan do boating I don't know every year we do our civic duty and but I Am saying look look at where it's important look at what states presidents do whatever the he's not doing eight states Lebanon rally blitz\nCalifornia Florida Iowa Ohio we all need you go do\nWhen you know at the end for example we sucked up Obama for eight years it wasn't good for the country you know what we would suck up a Nancy Pelosi as speaker one more time but I'd rather not I'd rather keep the progress that we've made the last two years going keep the momentum going\nUm but we'll do that either way um there are three possible outcomes total victory split decision house and Senate or a horrible night\nYou decide the Merrick and people have the power

everyone [laughter] All right Chris is with us in Kansas City we were trying to rush through and when it just decide not to do that which is a good idea so Chris in your range of income and business in marketing a career or ... your worst fear and your best year\nOh I never really made a whole lot of money on I don't feel like I ever really put my degree to work um I Would say my best year this is my wife and I's combined gross income was ...\nThe eighty thousand mhm I'm currently currently we make a between the two of us that grows a sixty thousand so we don't make a whole lot of money so well in your worst year when you started out probably\nOh just you know when I was Twenty one I'm making two Ninety an hour I think I've made twenty thousand a year\nAnd it's okay and your degree is in what\nA sin business of marketing hum I worked at a at a grocery store for thirty seven years or worked my way up\nAnd was a butcher actually and ah I was forced out about three years ago because they said I was too expensive and at that point in time I kinda thought\nI had enough money to retire but I didn't wanna pay health insurance so I just am a courier now and I don't make a whole lot of money I make fourteen dollars an hour but so I make enough to cover our living expenses of our retirement money is just sit and then throw it so I'm just kind of hold back\nOkay so you never mind over eighty but you're sitting on a one point eight million dollar net worth a tell me oh you did that once the key to that\nUh the key is the uh one thing I did it was kind of neat the first car I bought I did take a loan out\nFor a um a ever since I paid that first car I just kept\nMoney going into the bank so I every car after that I just paid cash or a and live within my means I'm\nWorking at the grocery store I used to see people that would come in and they would buy peanut butter and Dale bread and that's what they would try to live on the and I did not want to see myself doing that so\nI never uh I've never I Do I Do carry a credit card and I know that's against your teachings I pay off the balance every month than uh never paid any credit card fees at my entire life\nOkay so how do you end up at one point four or five million a mutual funds\nUm when I did work at this grocery chain every time I got a raise I put it into retirement um I think before I was forced out I was twenty two percent of my check into my four oh one K. every every week\nDid you guys go on vacation and enjoy your lives as you relive minor\nVacation so are they ... usually the traveling to the family somewhere or ... years they went somewhere every year but we did driving we did do flying we go to national parks do they outdoor thing or\nDidn't leave a lavish lifestyle you know we'd go out on the week that it wouldn't ah here in Kansas things weren't too expensive and and uh I just have never ever uh\nUh took out a loan for anything other than my house except for the first car\nNow steadily investing in avoiding debt and living on less than you might and watching your lifestyle there it is like good formula criticism I've heard it's called common sense well done sir proud of you\nOpen phones is our Chris Hogan Ramsey personality millionaire expert ... the author of the book every day millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth\nHow you can to and we want to take calls from you regardless of how you build your well maybe you inherited all of it we don't get many of those I'd like to hear from more of the minor league\nBut maybe they don't listen to show\nI mean that's the problem but um if they inherited the running on I don't know we almost never get them on a millionaire or but that's okay we want to learn what's really going on out there and let you guys know what's really happening in how it can be done and is with us in lacrosse Wisconsin and what's your net worth\nAt one point two million very cool and break that down forming how's that invest\nTime one third of the Ken my retirement one third and they can my business and one third of it and my real estate\nIn Cincinnati Hi Paul how are you\nCouldn't be better ... better than I deserve what's your network sir I'm calling for one points for an how's that invested\nYour ... to forgotten Mitch house so it's really hard to three fifty will won't know deli salad um and then a hundred fifty untangle shock and awe the rest is neutral tone and its portfolio\nOkay ... or so it looks like you've got about a million in in mutual funds right right okay very cool how old are you\n[noise] sixty three this week\nIn graduations happy birthday shown how much of this one point four million is there because you inherited money\nWell claim forty my mother left me forty thousand\nSo you're not a millionaire because of inheritance no now [laughter] I Love it\nAnd Paul do you remember your worst income year and your best income year\nVested income we're all started with the the 'cause I was the most recent that was the last year before I retired I was on a hundred and Ninety thousand okay I'm In the ... the war was completely on the other end of the ...\nI'll I'll tell you the year before I went in the air force I think I made about a thousand\nOkay and and looking at that what you what was your career before you retired\nI was a a sports specialist for a fortune one hundred company\nOkay and did you attend college not OK\nAnd looking at this did you use any debt outside of a mortgage to help you reach millionaire status\nOkay and as a household do you do any giving of ... what kind of giving do you do\nSpecifically if it were tied in with a charitable groups and sometimes it's a mixture of cash sometimes ... it's a actual the effort or work where\nYou are going to write and show 'em\nWhat advice would you give to the twenty five year old version of use is listening right now Ken this still be done and if so what do you do to get there\nI Would definitely can be done I retired I mean I just for whatever reason I may want to pick up a buck church work to do everywhere\nAnd what I say to anybody today is um our school I'd be afraid to work show up on time but most importantly what worked for me I didn't have the paper is I always called I didn't have the shoot 'em ups are kind of been fear that but what I did in ... opportunities\nSo when the door open not put my foot in\n'em and and that's the way I kind of scratch and called and got my way from two thousand do hiring Nineteen uh how old were you when you started investing in mutual funds I was a twenty seven years old what made you do that\n[laughter] [noise] and that was the year I think I heard you mentioned this on the show a ... stocks went on sale\nAnd our company at the time we started doing the matching fund and I just thought it was a no brainer to at least captured the ... percent there were match you\nKnow I'm at home a couple of years later I looked at it I had tens of thousands of dollars all of a sudden we were kind of cool\n[laughter] that's a nice thing to wake up to brother a congratulations very proud of you sir very well done interesting mix to day all day uh only two college graduates out of the whole bunch today that's exactly right most of the millionaires we studied in the millionaire study from your book the everyday millionaires\nDid graduate from college most of them did not graduate from prestige colleges throwing Seventy three percent I Believe it wasn't didn't not graduate from a prestigious college went to a state school but most of them did have a four year degree today\nOn the today show most of them did not that is right I mean or or a couple of associate's degrees and a couple of a high school graduates one with a GED at age thirty\nYeah it's amazing ... at the age is that we're looking at we got from forty three fifty sixty fifty seven forty eight to sixty three that was today yeah all today you know\nSo average age we found in the study was fifty two years old you know the average of all of them that's right of the ten thousand that we talk to\nBut the amazing thing is is we got also two to three of them started investing in their twenties so they got that first job got intentional early\nThey recognize the match shuts right orange scared of the mutual funds and were scared of the stock market as a matter of fact Paul was the opposite he jumped in when the market was down that's where I figured out hey that's down this time to get in\nWell because he ... he had listened to you explain that it's on\nSale and now he hadn't back then [laughter] he said that's that's the way it felt like\nThat right yeah you know the other one we had the one lady bet learn what not to do from watching her parents who ended up having to go down the path of bankruptcy and so this wisdom Dave this awareness this gaining the right kinds of information using the right tools that are out there for one k.'s and for three bees\nSo that typical millionaires not a crook no they're not an athlete but they're not an artist they're not an actor they hear it a ton of money didn't inherit their money no and the typical million or does not have a four point oh GPA\nIn other words there\nTelling me and if that's the case um you know an a letter from an attorney may solve the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nA show we need to get someone that gets their attention\nBecause basically you're getting run down I ... a corporate ladder here uh this is probably a corporate Lee owned or read owned apartment complexes being quote unquote professionally managed\nAnd so you're not dealing with a mom and pop you just got stuck in the vortex here and the only way to jog that out is shock somebody and so yeah I mean that you're going to write a check 'em you might as well decide which one you want to ride\nYou want to write a check for a gate that broke when your fault or do you want to write a check for justice me I like a good fight on my hillbilly so I'd rather just fight\nI really would I mean I'll spend I spend a million dollars completely destroying something rather than spend ten dollars to keep from doing the wrong thing it just drives me bananas I Can't stand it Josh is with us in Chicago hey Josh how are you\nDavid I'm doing great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um well my wife and I have been struggling for a few years to figure out how we should educate our kids um we'd love for them to be taught from a Christian perspective but\nAt the same time we'd love to pay off our house and I'm not sure what the best movers and financially responsible to do one or the other and I'm wanting to get your opinion [noise]\nUm well I mean typically a Christian school is a private school and there's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home in three years is the worst four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay but in other words this is going to delay the mortgage being paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view\nWhich is fine and um now I I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to 'em that you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a a private Christian school that they are actually implementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system that fly to the moon\n[laughter] they just ... they once had something that was Christian and and sometimes they are still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom and nothing to do with the values of miles hold\nAnd show if I'm going to do that I might have if I Will be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On enemy territory\nInstead of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're attempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done it can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education with\nThe quality of value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a ... or such and such with Presbyterian but that might have been many years ago and I and you know they've got that in their heritage but they're no more than fly to the moon anymore\nUm and so you know that then you just paid for an expensive school\nWith a questionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just to get help you with your critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to University of Tennessee\nA public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on the campus\n[laughter] okay I mean crazy and some of those professors are proof tenure should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers running around over there at my university campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there that just make your hair color or you know so my kids went there though\nBut here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home\nOkay and so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public university setting and they already had their values and backbone and apologetic established\nBecause of how they were raised inside the remedy house so they were equipped to go into\nThat environment and not quote unquote lose their salvation\nIn the process now I'm not saying no Ramsey kid ever did anything stupid I can promise you rented kids Ramsey are pretty much known for having done some stupid at one time [laughter] but but uh but but you know I you know you can do that in a Christian school too you know that right mhm right yeah ... right off campus was a bar\n[laughter] every one of those and so you can go get you can go get justice drunk at a Christian schools you can and the state schools all that to say I don't ... there's no bubble that protects them like your home does the preparation you give them at your kitchen table\nIs their insurance policy it's their fire insurance policy it's not\nYou know the name of the door of the school but that's not to say\nYou should never do ... I think it's perfectly fine as long as you pay cash for it\nAnd you're willing to say we're going to pay off the mortgage a little slower because of that and how would investigate and make sure that the values are actually taught in the classroom I put my kids in a private Christian school for two years when they were in uh elementary school and I found that some of the teaching they were doing over there and I'm like well this is useless complete waste of money\nRaising is as a mainstream I mean you know so I figured out it's going to be made that does this this was that I ... a\nRush Limbaugh weekdays an eleven on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and ... down in the ... [noise]\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I\nNeed life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is\nThe only way to protect them until you're out of debt and build up your wealth\nYou're only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans says it robs you of the ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to ... insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get all my insurance and they only offer the plans I recommend it is not expensive it's not complicated\nAnd Zander will be there as your guide every step of the way visit ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two you need to get this taken care of I can give you the advice and I can tell you where to go but it's really up to you to take that important step to get your family protected that's Zander\nDot com or eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two\nHey this is right so crazy that is always going to ask that you can buy quality things and he'll get a great deal that's why I live past and eat up mattresses packing needle offered amazing matches ... every budget\nAnd now they got a brand new matched track called nuts they kept their best mattress and made it even better it's incredible tri tech and eat all five hundred nights risk free at CNN dot com at ... dot com I don't remember it for free at CNN dot com\nEra's some exciting news simply savers now valued at one billion dollars\nFolks this company used to be just five guys working together now they protect over two million people and here's why simply say ... system is easy to use and takes just minutes to set up there are no contracts are hidden fees and twenty four seven monitoring is only\nFourteen Ninety nine a month visit simply say\nDirect dot com my listeners get free shipping and free returns that simply save direct dot com\nRush Limbaugh\nThat you want to talk radio and I got to be willing to be [noise]\n\nLike five five to five you're jumping off of your life and your money I've watched all of the day\nTom's from blind spots on find out for yourself why blind spots on is the number one online retailer of custom window coverings\nYou'll get free samples free shipping and with the new promos they run every month you'll save even more use the promo code Ramsey to get the best possible deal\nToday's question is from Brenda in Colorado a she comes to Dave Ramsey dot com and says is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick or something I should keep paying dental insurance is one of the most easy insurance is to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a a employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you would never spend that much on dentistry\nHum and go do just search there's some OT out on the road that way and pick up some serious change\nUntil but is there is there a pass a career path at home or whether it's owning your own shop or a you know I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J. O. B. at\nVersus a road jobs is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be cut the rocks I'm going to be turning over looking forward to how to do that and um you know where do I want to be one I'm forty and will be on the road [noise] you don't want to be on the road already you told me that getting married I don't blame you only get to go there will be home with his wife didn't\nMake good question I think you can figure it out but it's a tough one this is the day Ramsey\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W well lazy [noise]\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your long term ... doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you into whatever home loan program they're pushing that week when it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine but let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust an order taker\nWho pressures you into a pre packaged long\nMy friends at Churchill mortgage I'm helping my listeners for over twenty five years\nCalled Churchill mortgage and get customs solutions from an expert within ten minutes it's simple they'll shoot straight with you and quickly show you the real way to save money\nCall triple a loan two hundred that's AAA loan two hundred or visit Churchill mortgage dot com business paid advertisement and they must I eat one five ... consumer access dot org equal housing under seven sixty one over ... went to the the three Seventy two seven\n... radio Ninety eight point three you can tell you the [noise]\n\nLobby of Ramsey solutions Brian and personal law from Houston, Texas are with us hey guys how are\nYou are welcome all over here to do a debt free screen and that is currently how much you'll be paid off\nWe paid off one hundred and twenty nine thousand two dollars and fifty things that I\nLove how much how long does it strike you at that forty five nine forty five months and your range of income during that time\nOr we started at a Seventy thousand and one or two hundred and Seventy two thousand\nWell that's nice re explain a hundred thousand dollar increase in income\nUh I just got through sprint and thirty three months phone overseas assignment of Saudi Arabia\nOh OK as a contractor\nUh actually my company ... upper he's over there and a joint venture okay alright bend then they pay big money for you to do that now will say some of that is um employer pays or air tickets so I got to come home on a quarterly basis in the company covered that mhm so we're kind of a sexual and come right there to okay he's all\nRight well why do you guys think what kind of debt was a hundred and twenty nine thousand\nStudent loans it with ten credit cards to car payment\nWow you are normal normal just the man show what happened that spot for years you memorial is what happened four years ago they gave me this wake up call\nWell we're from South Carolina my church is having a financial planning class led by Joe single ...\nSo we just started falling ... nationally when you have the budget out called met when we started there well then we got married and I decided to combine our income ... I was writing I was writing all of our bills on the dry erase board and all the squares were full hey I've had enough so it's like I was like hey Dave Ramsey so\nI got online I Googled you and I thought everybody was like read the tell them they make a very so we got to go right now by that but we went to the\n... Barnes and noble book store and they have one copy last that was divine intervention there we go out and then we just went from there I read that book that night and gave it to him\nWell you know Syria than one night while I did you read reading\nIt was on the couch is that we use that actually critical or ...\n[laughter]\n\nThat's classic love it very good so you said you're from South Carolina originally but you've moved to Texas now there were okay very cool good good for you guys so what did you learn and the total when he may go where there might be able to do this what's the key to getting out of debt\nThat key is to not listening to other people have to say about what you're doing in your own life\nSo we actually kept it a secret in our family they don't really know that we are trying to work hard to pay off debts so we got a lot of a life ... got a lot of all you need a credit card for an emergency or early that I have a car payment chemical normal stuff we try to share a little bit of information with people because they were like how did you get through this they wouldn't listen\nSo we just kept its ourselves that day that the the craziest Niger on\nTheir close your ears on the line there's only go forward as you have to not care what other people think that is a big it's so hard to do to a ... they mean well they they look stupid [laughter] you know I mean they are I realized got family or friends or that one you know\nThey you know ... you can hear when their voice drops into that Charlie Brown teacher exactly\nThat's that's exactly why do you guys so the key is not listen to other people what are the keys to getting out of that\nOr if I can be brief oh the first thing is getting over beat yourself up over the mess you've made I mean you've made a mess and there was time to clean it up that's good a number to\nDo your research a fire in books articles watch videos um you know find their personal finance ... obviously there was this for you I'm left but it sit down and plan and budget were very competitive people so we've always challenging ... oh my go along with it for any married couples teamwork\nYou know it works the same as compound interest you know was a very powerful thing mhm\nUm for the single folks out there working on their debt snowball did an accountability partner hanging around people that are have those probably part of the relationship and that's one of his own you know I'm after\nHis focus because now this day and age where social media audio restrictions\nUm life happened to us during the day off and I happened to us you know before the end we rent a dating phase any engagement you know for example um before we were married she dealt with the person for several years dealt with the strings of unemployment I had written notice is on my door\nMy rent was only forty five at a time and I have a three straight much\nOf a late written notice there's ... so it was tough times and then even once we got into the snowball\nMom or a little bit before that whenever I got my job offer I went through a ... and it was sort of we're reducing things that were our fault for example when it got to use cars pitchers ... um we had a bunch of ...\nAnother wakeup call was when I got like ten Ninety nine foreign and seeing that my income with actually so much higher than I thought it was so that\nOf course got me wondering what the heck I was dealing with all my money and the last ... on actually won I mean a wonderful relationship with someone who is that free now we're engaged but at the time I knew we're headed in the direction of\nMarriage and that I just didn't want to bring the baggage with me so not long after I heard you mention in a workshop ... found the total money make over read it in a day followed the plant and here I Am\nWow look at that yeah So Paul positive influence\nOf the fiance and and then you go I got I had all this up and you went okay I've got to Google so I got to find somebody and then there are there I was in Glasgow well\nGood for you for a way to God\nAnd my gosh they like you say you know you feel like you got it rains and yeah and do it so much life is so much more fun now\nYeah um yeah what do you tell people to key to get a get out of\nDebt is\nCool um for me I think it's worth remembering how fast time flies by and how in a blink of an eye you wake up it will be\nTwo years from now and you can either be any during that same position or a completely different once so\nFrom a turnout ... from a tactical standpoint what did you do\nWhile you're there sign a budget before so making them budget ... to it and and\nI and I had to look at my numbers often so aside for every dollar I had a little spreadsheet of all my progress in my little projections and that's something that you know looking at it every single day reinforced by why and how great to be one day\nYou know was a train or you're you're already teaching goal setting a bad yeah that show just doing that for yourself that's what that was the incremental goal achievement to cap you going that's perfect well done exactly well don't you excellent so I think I Know who your biggest cheerleader was but I should ask\n[laughter] yeah you got it right it was my fiance like\nWhere to go bike or right very good stuff very good stuff well congratulations very very proud of me
