scream I Love it how much you'll be paid off a hundred and eighty thousand looking choose that's awesome how long does that take six and a half years six and a half years and a range of income during that time\nAnd starting out at ... at Seventy five thousand and ending around a hundred and sixty ...\nGood for you you guys are killing at what he'll do for a living on a licensed clinical social worker I'm a construction project manager for a interstate retailer oh okay very good well you guys are killing\nA way to go man like yourself what kind of that was this one hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nA hour eight thousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy two thousand with our wonderful student loans\nFrom a private Christian university\nWe were expensive spouses to each other [noise] oh\nOkay so this is your dropped from ... yeah All right and um then six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me six years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually hum when we went through financial piece at our church at the time\nOne of the things that you mentioned in your video\nWas a take cash with you when you when we were we were nearly ... went through and you should take cash would you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and flush the cashing in and talk to them that way so we were at a furniture store and I'm a very non confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took passion and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our department at the time and I'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm gonna walk as if we can make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up\nBy us I don't know that that that's just to show that\nThere is a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting down with our finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nFeeling in her stomach because of uh we're just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nUm so and so we started the class we now down to budget and did the envelope system we were really um persistent and faithful with envelopes us down and just really got serious about it on\nAnd I think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really um try to work on maybe step too as we paid by car off I'm relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first\nPretty big bonus from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time were like oh\nWe're we just at our budget you know a few months ago and so that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we uh\nWhy wouldn't you like a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt and our first uh you know we have two kids so it just makes a lot of kids in your\nOwn country [laughter]\nSo yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us and we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years or brothers or the last year was the last year the incomes doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year or kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and a half years and a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was I'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper\nOr to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan um\nI I think you just say I'm you know I don't\nDo well at this this and this and so I'm Better for that that and that and um it yeah I\nWhen I come over here to your organization I Want to be bring I Want to be a game I Want to be bringing you a hundred percent competency\nAnd when I'm outside of my competency it it doesn't indicate a lack of ambition it indicates a lack of self awareness on my part and I'm self aware enough to know that I'm not good at that\nAnd um so that's why I Want to step down not good at this and if that's the truth anyway I just tell the truth it's amazing when you do that how it just kind of releases you Eric with us in Afghanistan and don't get a lot of calls from Afghanistan Eric how are you\n[laughter] pretty is or how you doing\nBetter than I deserve your military\nA ... a former military I'm a contractor announcer\nOkay well thank you for your service how can I help today\n[noise] um Yes sir I'm I have a rental property addition to my primary home that I also rent out um but I was just mortified by my property manager that the house came up on the market or the house of\n'em that can kind of threw it out the uh there was an inquiry if someone actually wanted to buy the house and now my question was whether I should just sell the house or continue renting it out\nWhere is the house or Senate how Paso Texas\nWhere's your home is in southern Arizona\nOkay so when you finish contracting in Afghanistan and you live in southern Arizona if you did not on a rental property in El Paso Texas would you go by one\n\nOf what I go by another property if I\nDidn't have the opportunity you know I was in your lead in southern Arizona and you did not have any rental property and you've got bought it ready to buy a rental property I suspect you bite and southern Arizona NATO ...\n... absolutely yeah\nBecause you'd probably have this house left over from being stationed there right\n[noise] um yeah well I bought the house right out I was a right after I got done being stationed in or bless a I bought a home there then um I moved I ah 'cause it was it was a good deal they got the euro down VA loan so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight\nYou know ... ... after\nThe reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nIt's also for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you can apply that decision making tool to almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look over there and go you're not never buy another boat themselves that one\n'cause you don't use you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that's true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't\nBuy it again then don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but uh dumping I definitely do but not only is in Little Rock Arkansas oh Natalie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nPatty how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm how do you mean situation here I'm really not sure what you're going to tell me too but we're working through your plans or the baby ... baby step to I'm paying off that\nSo we only have one dollar emergency pot and and the only thing that we have left to pay off in my car which I just discovered you recently and six months ago when it was I really needed a new vehicle we did the same thing and buying a brand new car\nI Do a lot on my car about thirty five thousand dollars good lord yeah well\nAbout ... less than a week ago I was involved in a pretty big car accident and that cars now total okay luckily we actually bought that GAP insurance to cover the difference between a\nAwesome and when you're out awesome that were that free yeah hey\nBut we only have the one thousand dollar emergency find and I need a new car like yesterday\nGotcha and so what's your household income or about a hundred and fifty okay and um and you have one car right yes okay what does it\n[noise] it's a two thousand eight yeah I don't know a GMC Truck and go ahead and strike good\nGood okay they said well All right good [noise] wow uh I'll tell you what I did when I was in the same situation one time\nI rented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say five thousand dollars a month yeah probably so and then by five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get you a Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it\nOK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen okay then drive it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the armchair and talked about it or super thrilled about it but we we have a four O. one K.\nNo no no money anymore okay we don't borrow money\nWell okay\nIf you borrow money on four one K. it's a debt you borrow money is that borrowing it er yeah it's borrowing casting people if you catch it unless even worse if you catch it out they're gonna charge ten percent penalty plus thirty five percent on your taxes that support us borrow money a forty five percent interest effective way to bought by a car\nNow for me to have that mortgage and not a PM I\nAh there had to be a certain amount of equity which I didn't have in\nCash at the time so my father essentially get it means so what's your question the question is do I pay back the uh the the money to my father because I'm paying him ... I'm saying and be sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house to your dad you're going to stay on the house you're paid off for you I suppose you can absolutely and then you also first mortgage and then hopefully by then that rental will have come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd on your debt frozen uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude it's not my goal ... rental property as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand dollars upside down so well let's wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it a ... a year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather out a hundred and thirty six dollar check than a what a forty dollar checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling that a tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that it's just where you ended up by marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it in in the meantime pay off your second and pay off your first there we go think\nKevin's with us in Denver Hi Kevin how are you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nDuring my call a two part question I think you know the first part need help on the second part um\nMy dad came to me a couple of years ago and um he was getting ready to retire and want to take a or offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy for them I think he just kind of looking to get rid of the premium before he retired I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about whole life insurance\nBut he keeps telling me I Need to hang on to it mhm and keep it so that when he retired or excuse me when he\nPasses I have money to pay the taxes on uh the inheritance money that will be coming to me and\nSo how large assistant state\n[noise] uh I Would say close to a million\nThere's no taxes on his estate\nSo nobody should own impacted on no you don't have the ... there's no tax federal there is no federal or state tax on the states over ... ... unless they're over five point for nine million this year\n[laughter] okay so everything like so all hit so he's he is I think he's converting most like his raw than it\nFor only caves and all those things so\nIf it was a state is one million dollars there's no taxes on the\n\n... any taxes on any of it\nNow you might pay a state probate tax but there's no federal estate taxes on in the state of one million dollars\nNot see we're okay\nTo have over five million dollars for the fence to get after you so so if he's got you know what he's doing he's parroting back what the idiot whole life agent told him that sold in this\nYou need to keep up their cause of her state tax planning\nAnd and he's been hearing that since you were born and so he's a bidding those same words back out like a parrot and the cage\nOkay but I don't know what he's talking about okay and neither did the whole I got a job for that matter\nBut OK okay and so as far as like a conversation with him about that because when he gave it had some value is worth about eight thousand\nNow now we're down here I really appreciate you and I appreciate the intent behind this the more I've investigated it I think I'm positive that my financial coaches telling me that I can do a better job\nWith this eight thousand dollars than leaving it in this policy is policies not couldn't grew in with my plans so while I Want to honor you and be grateful to you until you think you also need to let you know I'm catching it out [noise]\nAwesome and I was in ... and ... back at you then then he's not respecting the fact that you're now what's known as a grown man\nMake my own decisions got my own ZIP Code now\nThat's Monday on this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten ...

talk radio Ninety eight voice three and Fifteen cent W well ac\n\nFrom August Georgia right here in the\nOf Ramsey solutions Hi Dale how are you\nI'm doing great thanks Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help [noise] ah well I had a an unusual question and I've been pondering it for a while I'm\nAfter my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends in their garage apartment mhm so I have used the kitchen restroom and laundry on normally think she would renting a room um\nBut I came across a condo that I'm Wondering the realtors owned and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy mhm and it rents and was rented [noise] when I bought it for a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month\nAnd my rent where I Am in only five hundred\nAnd this one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been hunting do I want to move into it make it in my own home now that it's vacant shall we bought it and it's rented right okay and what's your income oh average about thirty five thousand a year commissions\nMhm okay well the the way I answer questions is what always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good and the short term might not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd a show or when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which these decisions takes me there okay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay and you can live in a garage apartment till you're sixty five and you can make the transactional spread here I'm making extra some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question that's yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can to increase my income during the next ten years and be living in a condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really wasn't a it's kind of camping well when you're not a college student [laughter] I mean this was camping that's right you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because of the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you got your found footing under you again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a gumbo I'm probably moving into their condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like Seventy thousand understood the thirty five and what trick them on their what am I gotta do to get mine to part of healing is believing in yourself again at away ... are Arab living yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut a ... if that's where you are that's where your head is I think I'm going to move into the condo now if you're headed is saying you know I think I'm probably going to the solemn ever going to do I'm just going to route thirty five thousand into retirement\nYou might want to know the garage apartment or the other money in your pocket but I don't think that you\nI'm not really like to purchase a house yeah keep the condo is rental income now well let's get it paid off is paid off oh good that'd be awesome them you will by if you get an extra money to about beyond Tobias worth\nSaving not at the moment not OK\nThan living in that condo with no payment at all you know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that goal faster so um I I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh I'm back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back\nYeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my income is going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm ... I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that ... you know you got past that stage now your back\nIs that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we can all your data for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on the head on retirement but we're behind on college savings tracked you can show how old are your kids\nBut it's not a huge one I mean it's going to produce Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year in income\nAnd um then they've got the other uh Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year coming in from Social Security give or take ... and they gotta live on that otherwise they burn through this nest egg and they ended up having to sell the farm in their old age right and I don't want to do that so as long as they'll keep\nA spending less than the income that is produced by the two hundred\nAnd their Social Security stay on our household budget that's below that then the game plan you and I just talked about will run in perpetuation no matter how long they live\nOkay is that it's not logical to you sir\nAs long as they do that then yes I Would do it in a heartbeat a cause I Love the idea of going into your you know your latter years will everything paid for especially your home box when your home is paid for and you're sixty seven\nYou stabilized for the next Thirty years to your Ninety seven your ... your your housing costs and your housing costs as the largest cost in your budget\nSo if you're renting your rent goes up every year for the next Thirty years if you're sixty seven and and that sounds like homelessness to me later unless you've got a huge mistake\nAnd so by owning and by owning with no debt you've completely stabilized your golden years Tyler is with us in Oklahoma City Hi Tyler our you\nHey Dave I appreciate you taking my call\nSure man what's up\nWell my uh wife and I did our debt prescribing last year in July so we're on scraps four or five and six awesome when I got back to the Oklahoma City area ... a couple of months later he started to change my job an employer and I are gay or\nWhat appeared to be a better job of shit for us our family at the time and it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week [laughter] I'm working through the debt snowball off my student loans [laughter]\nI think I pretty much burned myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training as skilled in such that I'm new at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's why I'm trying to figure out I've been reading books like crazy just last year [noise]\nBecause I'm passionate about um group small business I have an entrepreneur heart and I still like", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "29"}
