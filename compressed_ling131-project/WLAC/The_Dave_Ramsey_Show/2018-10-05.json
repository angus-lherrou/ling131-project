W. I.

I don't have any payments I've been doing this day Ramsey financial piece stuff I'm living in Hammond handling money God's rushed and I'm obey okay\nAnd she said all of a sudden when I just add to the reality of my situation and then I got twenty thousand dollars in the bank for my emergency and I got a couple of hundred grand and my four oh one K. and I got no payments I took that reality and I thought you know what I'm going to be okay and you know what will happen is you'll find a job\nMaking more than she used to make up the place they kicked her to the curb best what will happen to her and that's what we prayed for her that night that that would happen\nSo she's the other side of where you are Bethany she's pushed through and then when something bad happened and\nMurphy shows up when Murphy shows up and you're out of debt and you have your emergency funding emergencies no longer an emergency it's an inconvenience\n\nYou you know when you get your act together it change Murphy

will you live looks like a country song you know what I'm Talking about\nI mean it when you're broke it just seems like there's no way and you've gotta do something to fight away from the broke land I mean you've got to get out of the land of the broke right\nSo that when Murphy shows up you can hit him with a baseball bat does he does show up he shows up and all of our lives only difference is\nWhether you're ready for it [laughter] so you come and buddy [laughter]\nYou're not cool you show up at the wrong house we're ready for you see that's a different situation isn't it\nAnd what

paid off what do you don't like the keys to getting out of debt are\nBut like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh\nI always wanted to drive a new car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment so you know you pay for a guard for five or six years\nAnd they would again you'd think it should we get another payment and uh so we have not had a car payment for four years we were driving to very old cars one is sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old while but we drove it up here from South Carolina this morning and it made it finds out and made it find it gives us where we need to go and you know never again\nIs that there were times when we would look load up and buses full of activists by simply giving

make sure that they go and do the job that we sent them to do it's a long way from when I was president of the N. double ACP twenty seven years ago to where I Am now and that plantation that Reverend\nPeterson was talking about the jets the lady was talking about by the way Jesse leaders in my movie runaway slave or just leave on why am I not in your movie what's up with you and I have to make the next film together Sean we have to make the next I don't know I I'm\nJust wondering why you picked Jesse and you didn't pick your friends Sean Hannity\nYou're about to go about it you got to come on the show real so what that plantation was real I grew up during that same Jim Crow era it's very real but many of us have run away from it\nAnd we encourage many more at this point in time in America and the president is giving us all the number that's necessary to run away from that type of in slate but if this nation that following up on ...\nYou know the attitude at the beauty of what President Trump is jarred is that because he lack\nFear he's put country first he's not afraid to really deal with people is not afraid to use social media\nTo put the truth out there and just credit isn't cars you know a lot of men and women fetch and those are good to stand up and speak a fight for their country fight for what is right and when they saw this attack on judge Kavanaugh his wife\nHis daughters while they're saying that they care about women care about children we actually love compassion for the judge and his wife his children I got to have to deal with these allegations\nHit this whole thing has to now look we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and I am cautiously optimistic that judge Kavanaugh gets to be on the court that he deserves to be on\nWhat if we don't deal with the these tactics the willingness to tear down bludgeon destroy men families kids are obviously impacted by it if if they can't even have the most simple as the civility on these issues\nYou know the American people need to see it no it get it understand it embrace what they would be voting for it's horrible you know destroying people it's horrible how many more people have to go through a Clarence Thomas judge Kavanaugh Robert Bork\nHow many Republicans are falsely accused of being racist and wanting to kill their grandmothers it's ridiculous at this point\nAnd they do it

away from having to worry about their so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at that job and find out you had that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in my ear might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through is you feel the tyranny\nThe tyrant in your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly\nAnd out of almost ... out of almost a desperation an emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail\nHere correct okay and so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate\nBecause you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing and flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff naturally now how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and\n... good and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't like that yeah that's probably about twenty three thousand kinds\nThat is not bankrupt All right okay and do you have any IRS that\nNo just um foreclosure on the house\nOkay and what type of a home loan did you have F ha VA or conventional\nUm do we watch started off ... but then I got I'm told in finance and I'm at this point I don't even remember what kind it was okay\nPossible that they're not going to trace you at all\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars\nAnd the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to see in your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy to see them\nBankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again right\nStarts at all new but if you can just clear these things up they drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy ...\nBut to day I Would not file based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight you're going to be okay if I Am able to start paying off but that we will be back it goes from a smaller statue largest where\nI Would love to swim smallest largest and I would call the smallest one in subtle with them\nFor ten to twenty

five years old still work the work and the steel plant makes about four fifty to six fifty a week um about a couple of years ago he got sick\nI found out that he had a hey\nHe's behind on a lot of itself had a somehow got in a fifty thousand dollar loan from\nThe bank and he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen\nHundred and some security and I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I did provide him took over on the bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out your four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh definitely yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six\nAveraged ... deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight but once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that those numbers included infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank

this point um [noise] we paid off to credit cards\nAnd we paid off another credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me it's about down the

you squeeze out of your budget as you said with thousand dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except your home bothers senior deaths\nSmallest allows you attack\nLaws by

honored\nTo have you sir thank you how much that did you pay off a paid off a forty five thousand dollars and Eighteen months good for you well done and your range of income during that time I started at about fifty then around a hundred then it got down to about ... okay cool what do you do for a living I'm a truck driver oh neat\nWell you are dressed up truck drivers had thank you thank you that's the biggest days and so I don't think most of our truck drivers aren't rolling here in a suit and tie a I'm I'm hearing yesterday on Sunday close oh no no no a round the clock\nWell well done sir who do you drive for yourself or for a company a dress able to express their not a real action absolutely no Gary so very cool okay good good excellent what kind of that was the forty five thousand\nOh man well uh I had a little bit of everything I had a well diversified portfolio\nUs loans uh ten credit cards a couple of cars everything everything wow\nHow old are you thirty four okay and I take it you're single since you're standing nearby yourself yes when my girlfriend's oh with your girlfriend aren't that works so what happened to Eighteen months ago that the phone rings and dairy Derek answers the columnist and God's just wake up\nWhat happened well I saved up a little bit of money and I've paid off well paid on like ten credit cards and I thought I was doing a good thing and then the next month came around and I noticed that all of the ... the minimum payments were like ten dollars cheaper than it was the previous month and I said this isn't the way to go\nSo from there I just started the search around on ways to pay all that and then I actually saw the baby steps and then when I saw this\nI don't have time for baby steps I Need you out of the day tomorrow so I just kept looking around and then I saw um\nThe debt snowball maybe not clicked on the death snowball and then when you were talking about the baby steps again so I said I Can't get away from this guy so I'm just watches man started listening to it and I actually went to one of your small conferences in Raleigh oh yeah and they're from there I was I've been on fire ever since then\nCool well done well done sir other field I have no payments Eighteen months later\nRight okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty six thousand divided into two hundred thousand right rather than it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it in about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I Would want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so we'll we'll go ahead and get when you're that maybe if we did you think you might be a guy to do maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young was zero house payment you you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you sound like they create your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve month good for you and\nYes and I'm Down to just one dead which is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm I with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband has been a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now ball and just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that\nScares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it yes that's one problem with the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not reporting it\nToday doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and report it at any time\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection a agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark but a bad mark because this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at this point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum ... and I would build up a you know a lump sum of three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay\nBut in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you all the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure one time I have I have a question [laughter] I\nAm Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for my tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I when I took a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me a several other options\nUm some of the other options were to take a fixed\nAnnuity monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no [noise] I neither one was to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums are non you're alive and then it went raised to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above 'em up so uh [laughter]\nThe anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra seizing dodges notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call that his bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance your homeowner's insurance together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so forth I smelled harassed and you have a good you have a good nose on your kid out [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you this I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other\nAnd finally if we can be seniors in high school and homecoming queen and king we'd be happy then and then when you're a senior in high school some of your buddies go off to college and you know in college I don't care if you go to class\nNobody takes Romania there's nobody looking over your shoulder you can like be a grown up if I could just get to college I'd be happy then and and then you get to college and you go man this is hard\nIf I could just get out of college and get married and have to point three kids and buy a house on the street with a picket fence and\nStart my life I'd be happy then you get out and you get married to point three kids you know I Want to go back to college to be happy [laughter]\n[noise] have you ever noticed that happiness is a bully in the schoolyard\nAs soon as he draws the line with his toe in the sand is just cross this and we'll fight you step across that line he backs up new draws the line\n\nYou cannot buy happiness with money you can even chase it down 'cause it's always moving you can buy fun\nIt is a bomb on to go on a really nice Cruz is ... ... to go to ... bay and dive one of two underwater national parks the other one's key Largo\nIn the nation\nIt is ... ... to see the ... glacier in Alaska it is fun you can buy fine\nBut you can't buy happiness\nThe most powerful financial principle you will ever learn in a culture that is full of angry people\nIn a culture that is full of is ... sexism racism is ... everywhere in a culture full of mean angry disjointed toxic people\nThe most powerful financial principle you ever have\nIs this one contentment\n\nWhen you are content to just be\nThen you're not at the Beck and call of a bunch of people telling you how to live with the way they live on Facebook they're highlight realism Facebook nobody really lives that way\n\nYou don't have to do what other people think you're not driven by other people's opinions and you're not chasing\nHappiness which is a bully in the schoolyard when he draws a line in the sand he'll back up and say I'll be happy when I get that new car I'll be happy when you want when I get to go on vacation I'll be happy when I get to quit work and stay home with the kids know you want\nHappiness is not a destination you can buy a fun with money and I don't mind you're doing that\nBut where you'll get in trouble is if you get confused because if you get confused between fun and happiness you will never achieved contentment and if you never achieved contentment you will always be in debt because you'll always be buying stuff with money you don't have\nStuff you don't need with money you don't have to impress people you don't even really like 'cause I'll be happy when I'll be happy when\nFamous last words of broke people contentment content people once you reach a level of contentment you can get out of debt pretty quick because you're suddenly don't care what other people think and you certainly don't even care what you think\nYou're just like it's going to be OK I'm All right\nWhen you reach content your generosity goes way up because you don't feel like you have to have that money to be happy when [noise] when you reach a level of contentment you're investing level goes way up and the weird thing is is your wealth level will\nGo up you have a higher propensity a higher probability statistically of being wealthy by being content was not being wealthy [laughter] ... say you're able to avoid that and you're able to increase generosity and you don't live your life in this costs the state of dissatisfaction saying\nI'll be happy when [noise]\nThis is the diversity [noise]\n\n\nDave\nRamsey on the radio that ... if

I ... I don't think we broke English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nLet me put it this way for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second homeless or vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the costs of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a uh like house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in and the you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over in Knoxville in one of the ball game over there and the heat and air was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nWell very well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations well what we teach folks is to follow a plan and we call the baby steps we think it is the shortest raped shortest route to wealth\nOkay and a baby step one is a thousand dollar shave too is debt free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off our surely so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that some non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nTrack and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right\nYup okay and um\n[noise] the uh the way I look at that is ... if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities or bought you own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nThat I buy that if we if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to three to six months of expenses at ... you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick\nI might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you have that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nA it's on there were about a hundred and ...\nThat's not bad it's only to the only two years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nOr be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payments used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing plus here's what's kinda weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd a ... you know what else will happen is did you do remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nOr ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years and yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about ... because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the lender that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have\nAny ... no\nWait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so they will get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "05"}
