L. A.\nNot you're joining us American we're glad you're here this is the Dave Ramsey show open phones or ... five five shoe to\nJake's on Facebook\nAnd follow me there ... dot com slash Dave Ramsey and you'll get part of the messages we put on their\nFacebook does not put everything through the throttle are measures so they can make\nUs by ads from well it doesn't really work that way guys but I Try anyway he says what's the difference between a credit union in a bank\nA bank is owned by stock holders that when the bank makes a profit and they should make a profit we want them to make some profit\nWhen the bank makes a profit the stock holders the owners of the company\nYet that profit basically I mean it is the\nProfits dispersed in the form of um dividends or the value of the stock has increased because the bank continue ... whatever it is but basically the owners of a bank are stockholders and that's where the profit goes a credit union is operated more like a cooperative\nWhere the owners of a credit union are there it's actually not for profit technically speaking and um the not the owners of the credit union are the credit union members which are also the customers\nAnd so as a customer of the credit union the services and interest rates and whatever you pay in with a credit union they profit that has created\nIs return to the members in the form of increased services or in the form of actual dispersed much\nI mean sometimes you actually just get a little check from your credit union put into your account and so uh that's the difference uh banks don't don't offer banks don't like credit union as they say they have an unfair advantage\nBecause there have nonprofit status I'm One of that's really not true\nUm the it's real simple the credit union simply does not make a profit because whatever profit is made just fall back into cheaper checking accounts better interest rates on loans or higher interest rates on savings\nAnd so the you know basically they end up not making a profit so if a bank wanted to uh make less profit could do the same thing\nSo they don't have a disadvantage they're just trying to keep stock holders happy and sell stuff to customers the credit union has customers that are the stockholders in a sense the owners are the members and so it returns and all of that really doesn't matter ... bit\nIf you don't get good service from the organization\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions are not because of their nonprofit status but because they have reasonably priced goods and sir reasonably priced banking services for you to use and you'll be treated not like a number\nYou we treated ... by you know people that actually care you'll also have that similar experience at a local community by a regional bank and that's who I Do business with personally\nI don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our a personal accounts are all have local\nOr reach our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it just because I Need to pick up the phone to talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nSo uh it's a little different with family you just have to set a boundary and just go OK guys we're going Dutch tonight I mean everybody's paying their own right\nI'm paying mind you're paying years while you're at right now I Know but that's why I'm debt free 'cause I'm cheap show you're paying your own and so um you know you just call it out and you just have some fun with it laugh about it'd be sarcastic about whatever your family gift is right and I'm In some of them are going to be upset but if they're going to be upset 'cause you don't buy their\nFood than well oh well you know\nAnd as far as friends go do the same thing but if this is a continual thing then we just aren't you know it's not a real friend because a friend that you have to buy the relationship that's called prostitution and that's not friend okay and so um you know I don't have to buy my friendships\nMy my friends I've got friends that are wealthier than me and friends that are nowhere near as wealthy as me\nI'm doesn't matter I might buy dinner but that's my choice not on their expectation\nI'm I'm pretty generous um I've done a lot but I don't I don't think about it but the point my wife is like you really don't need to pay every time I but I don't I'm not worried about it is but if I ever since somebody being title I get all hillbilly and a second you know and be like\nNo you're not entitled um and my wife has a little bit more uh\nShe has this thing about fairness and so she wants everything to be fair and I'm just trying to explain to her fingers what happens at the county fair is not gonna happen but but you know you just ... that's okay I mean you talk it through is what I'm saying and\nYou're going to find occasionally somebody that you're not going to be able to continue in relationship with and um that could even be family if it's extreme but hopefully it's not something like that that's very hurtful for you but um most of the time it's just like no you know we're paying our share you pay your split it up\nOr this time we're going to give you a gift and we're going to pay for everything but that's on your option is not a gift of its entitlement so it's a good question though um and that happens more\nIt probably happens more to people with family than it does with French\nI mean you got a real low class group of friends of all your friends expect you to pick up the tab all the time just because your debt free I mean you're running with some try to a park trash you know I mean really\nYou you you got to think about that I just I that that really it's more of a family thing for most people um I Will tell you that honestly\nAs weird it is for us um was sharing an eye because we're kind of in the spotlight uh we've had very little boundary issues with family or friends\nOn this we've been really blessed were really fortunate and ah so that's the tip of the hat to both of them that we've had almost no times that we've had to sit down with a friend and got a new and almost all times with family I mean it's um but our families are you know\nResponsible hardworking people I mean it's that kind of thing and so\nIt's just that we're blessed in that way because I Know people that you know they get their record deal when all of a sudden some cousin they didn't even know comes out of the woodwork you know and uh I've not had that I Know I've got some cousins that I don't hardly know but none of them came out of the woodwork they stayed in the woodwork good for them\nIt's not looking for money away I wouldn't mind seeing some of them but I mean don't come looking for money we don't even though you are so um it it's something everybody deals with I think you know you hear people like it the lotto when this and then crazy sets in and their family and art I I'll tell you where else I run into its where they sent a fellow players\nMan they got a big signing bonus and crazy comes out of the woodwork on them I mean they get some dysfunctional crap and their laps it's amazing and are people who feel entitled to a piece of their success and it it it really is really as an illness that's a problem\nStephanie is with us in

I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash than for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did find just to cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nDo there should be doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nThank you [laughter] I'm On earth laid we've been together a long time you and I [laughter]\n[laughter] so question for you so my wife and I only have about three hundred okay and and student debt another hundred and Fifteen and automobile a line of credit that type of thing so I was about four Fifteen\nAnd you know we make a pretty good income shootout about one we want to annually I met one eighty three hundred come on\nMy question for you and I was a move back to school and get my master's programs only twenty five okay to feel like they wouldn't be a very real are awhile niche\nBut

your income by more than twenty five K.\n[noise] it would probably be hard to say I'm there would be a winning case and we raised as the category of jump into mhm\nOkay are you doing that you can get back into it would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in a very expensive area granted it's crazy expensive but I don't want to live in a really ... yeah but you guys are really you're really ...\n... ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that menu be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt\nPlan but you do you like know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare talk to me by buying anything else\nYou bought enough for a while you need to you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this that\nAnd then the process of doing that can you we've\nPoint three meant to be seen men in the ...\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right\nPerson zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's

... seat\nOr so was this is the Dave Ramsey show\nRandomness on Twitter Ivan equity line of credit on a rental property\nWhere we're paying this off fall into the baby steps what brand on if it's relatively small you easily could stick it in to baby step to most of the time we let real estate dead of all kinds\nOf lay a baby step six uh if you have a very large equity line of credit on a rental property you might want to refinance it into a traditional mortgage and get rid of the risk associated with the pop and interest rates are possible call provision for that line of credit\nAnd I don't want to get yourself in a pinch with a bank calling notes uh that they're allowed to call based on the way that is written in that that lack of liquidity as we see could put you in a problem you know the cash to pay 'em [noise]\nSo um but so you know you got like a ... you make a hundred dollars a year you got a hundred thousand our line of credit that's probably refinance\nYou make a hundred thousand dollars a year and he got then does on line of credit it's probably a baby step to item on the point is\nWe want to work through the debt but we want to get on with retirement an emergency fund and a reasonable paces well and I figure out where we're going from there so good question Matthew is in Daytona Hi Matthew how are you\nI'm good and you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um how do I have for college and not go into debt\nOkay how old are you ... Eighteen very cool what are you going to study\nUm possibly um [noise] pretty much anything that I can get into our ... I can\nI T yeah she said okay so you like technology yeah All right\nWell um I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web programmer and um\nI've got folk guys on my team that make 'em in excess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that that that ah right ruby on rails code okay\nNot ... not a bad career and uh that's an example of an ... type of a thing okay and Web programmer writing code\nNow if you're going to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou wouldn't need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you know some of the basic IT things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school a which is probably a two year degree\nWhile you're studying that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field uh and if you can\nYou know bring coffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hanging out from them and you're new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders ... is in a you know and you're taking some classes that'll get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and there's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say I cheat but you could change your mind but I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specials\nYou know here's another one you should have long term disability insurance\nEveryone should have long term disability insurance\nIf unless you are in in in the industry were each such high risk and you're just it's nutty it cost you ten thousand dollars a month to have it you can't because your you know you're\nA high rise window washer or something like that right you can't get long term disability insurance but other than that everybody ought to have long term disability interests uh most of the time you can get it through your work and it's not that expensive if you have long term disability insurance don't buy wave your premium\nOn your life insurance\nAll that does pay your life insurance premium for you if you become disabled so what is that it's a little tiny baby\nMiniature long term disability insurance policy salt is and it's very expensive one very expensive\nIt'd be better off to use that same amount of money to increase the coverage of your existing long term disability or help you buy it if you haven't bought it yet and you heard me today and you need to get long term disability\nOr you go just like that again gimmicks they're everywhere particularly around the life insurance world and just buy insurance oh you know one one friends with that\nNo one else ... with that I just wanted a hamburger no I don't want for us with that you were friends with it there's always an upgrade there's always an up so stay away from it Benjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how're you\nDoing great how are you today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] have a question for you my wife and I are currently working on baby step to uh we have one more quote unquote non mortgage debt to pay off what should we paid off by the end of the year in bill have um [noise] that is technically is technically a mortgage because we bought a house to use it a rental\nSo that would allow you to write so I didn't know offensive for rental um if that still considered a debt and should be paid off as part of baby step to six or if we should move that\nNot six she with mortgages are insects\nOkay even if it's not my home\nEven if they're not your heart the rental even if you're home because it's usually it's typically you know most people listening if they have a rental property is a large that and we're we're done with the baby step too as we are getting rid of all the ... and or consumer debt sometimes are large but we're trying to get rid of all of that and that really gives you a huge\nAmount of cash flow to do baby step three finish your emergency fund for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and five kids college and six oh we'll go ahead and pay the mortgage off ... on the rentals and our personal residents Emily is with us in Cincinnati Hi Emily how are you\nHow about yourself better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um I\nWe sold our house and purchased a um try rental flash home we buy a horse farm and we are renting out the horse farm facility but living in the house and renting out paying our mortgage mortgage is very large now\nAnd I'm kinda panicking about I don't like that at all [laughter] and I had been looking at it as a business and investment um and I want to pay it off really act that we've heard that we don't want to pay that off very it got the tape that had\n...
