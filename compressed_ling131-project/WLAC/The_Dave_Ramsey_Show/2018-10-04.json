a sudden you start realizing OK man I've\nTo have a secondary move I've got to be able to work on this and so right\nNow he's just in the midst of trying to build his catalogue of of moves in in

and play out you know execution so I'm a kid is going to continue to get better of it he he's he's a primetime player but it's like anything else he's just got to continue to keep keep getting rats keep going you're going to make some mistakes but it's going to make more plays the mistakes no question\nAbout that does spark er here on on Twitter asks this is a good question and by the way which ... is the hardest to defend\nThe Arpaio uh the pro set you know ... which one is the toughest to defend [noise]\nUm [noise] they're all ... to defend probably depends on the aries analogy and the personnel doesn't it well it really you know a lotta times depends on the quarterback yeah Hi proficient\nThe quarterback is running his office a spread outfits can can be can be a if a quarterback is not a runner but you know when he throws around much like a really drew lock\nOr you don't know when you look at him but he has the ability to scramble but you know he he ... he can he can carve you up a little bit or you know Jay Bentley you know the same way but those guys were fishing in our offices and they have weapons so if you have weapons uh it it it it creates a one on one you got to win the one on ones so like\nFor me um you know all these offices whether it's spread whether it's a you know the ... of the rich you know somebody that plays in a post office if they understand where to go with the football and they can re coverage okay in and get their office in the correct play [noise]\n... it's it's it's hard because when you start talking about the R P o deal it's really a letter man football because when the quarterback\nIs the most of the time when you're looking at the post office is probably ten or eleven because when you're not telling the quarterback says that during the quarter back into the game but when you start looking at Arpaio's into quarterback and pulling\nIt it's it's different for you because you have a safety who's who's who generally deep or two guys that are deep but you're not accounting for the extra gas that's created by the quarterback if he pools and and so you're backers come up they create windows okay maybe your coverage guys are a lot of coverage there's a lot of space between the\nThe secondary support okay man and your guys who are defending on the edges and so that they [noise] it it really great space in anytime you have vacuums are holes or windows ... it can make it extremely tough because now it becomes a space\nSo I think they're all difficulty just all depends on uh\n... in it how proficient he is in the office\nI think it's interesting I I Know you watch all of this I Know you keep up with all the stuff to an end and we're fans and we we follow the NFL and all that but\nI Would tell you that I Believe\nIt might be the toughest challenge to stop the ... in the SEC yes with all these quarterbacks into all these ... I mean you can go down the list you know two and Alabama and and lock and\nAnd what Kentucky does and what everything you can kind of go down the list I Would think this is about as difficult as it gets\nWell it it is because they say all present different challenges again everybody has weapons most of them I mean we're we're we're in a time and the SEC what you're seeing such great quarterback play all the way around\nThat you're facing you're seeing you're seeing these quarterbacks who have been around they've they've been developed they understand where to go with the football and these coordinators are utilizing that only the quarterback with the skill sets up the guys that are that are\nOut there to create matchup issues um\nI'll tell you you want to know how difficult it is a\nThis week alone I had two friends that I'm not going to say things that I had two friends that are\nAre NFL coordinators that called me and said listen how do we stop this you know ... and it was about Arpaio conversations and I was like okay well go look at this game go look at a\nThis team and the SEC look at what they do because you know watching the this is a pretty good idea here's what we've done and and some of that was on display this weekend so so so when you talk about ... ... and and I talked to me last week but I saw these teams play this weekend and and they they they looked at the film\nOr because NFL teams have have access to all the college games today if if they want to go see a\nGeorgia versus a Missouri they can if they want to go see a a you know Alabama versus you know Georgia that they can sort of got a they've\nOf film to look at but when they're asking you wouldn't you know it's a problem you you do you know how hard it can be to defend so I mean how believe that the same issues that we see this level they're starting they'd been seeing at that level and and and that's what makes this game a such a chess match because uh\nYou you you really have to have answers of it it's it's not one thing in ... on defense is never one thing that you call it the mix because you have to you have to spread the stress around so ... so and so you don't keep it on one guy and I keep it on one guy there there are there going to continue that slows\nYou have guys asking you in the NFL stop this correct yes this week this well last week as we are today yeah\nYeah I mean that that's Jason Jason that I have both talked about Jackson's like man you know I mean I come back to the college game and I\nOf guys called me about you know ... how do you defend Arpaio's because it it it it it it started at the ... you know college lower now you're starting to see so many appeals teams or you don't have to get a federal level you see a Baker Mayfield average Carson when it's a they use the\nHomes okay maybe these are P.

C.\nTexas and Virginia are with us hey guys how are you doing well hey Dave hey I see on my screen your debt free congratulations\nYou're angry white collar anything like that phrase grain\nLove it how much of you guys paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars for how long does that say about Tony form a\nMan and your range of income during that time\nYeah we started off at about a hundred K. and then we picked it up to about three hundred thousand\nWow what are you guys do for a living\nSo I'm an executive recruiter for GE and then um I also teach part time with a multitude of uh on line universities\nAnd and I'm a director in HR ... like\nOh God that's my friends very cool so you're working for Robert okay cool that's a blast\nGood for you guys were great income four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars what kind of that was that\n[noise] yeah it was basically student loans the majority of it about three hundred and Seventy about actually garnered and sixty nine thousand of dollars about student loans and then tax bill we had about twenty nine thousand [noise] and then not too small credit cards about forty five hundred and then we cash flow to wedding in about Fifteen thousand\nYou guys have a law student loan debt yeah [laughter] yeah where are you there I was ... or you just overwhelmed by that that oh yeah oh yeah that was it so ah did you cash flow every bit of this\n[noise] [noise] oh yeah yeah we did and\nI mean you just that that's an amazing number twenty four months even with the fabulous income you've had that's still very incredible very well done so tell me your story what happened twenty four months ago\nMay foul and she can I wear engage them and we came to the table with bank has college education and then my college education\nAnd and ... astronomical ... fight outlets and settling and very easy for I pretty much when we first start in on our marriage we immediately got on the bandwagon to pay off and are standing around\nAnd my sister and she had actually introduced um you two are the only about Fifteen Years ago and I remember\nFeeling I remember that feeling of being overwhelmed and I tell them she was like ... and you know they ran the friendly how animals with just the budgeting take it out of their way and then we just kind of near Lancaster didn't we didn't have that piece on friendly fire to protest but life with us in my own\nHouse and we both need that for him to just start off and barely from the very beginning where like\nWhere you're going to do their main while dream that we are going to do that\nI mean you guys you had an extreme situation so you brought extreme measures to deal with it\nAnd going and very very while\nAmazing so what do you tell people the key to paying 'cause I mean you're the story everybody's talking about you know in in the news and all these these young people are overwhelmed with student loan debt they're all die and they're gonna you know their whole generation is stunted and all this stuff and yet\nTwenty four months later you're done with four hundred and Eighteen thousand you're impressive\nThat's amazing so what in the world what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nUm I Would probably say just getting on the same page um you know we've been married now for about two and a half years and I think just getting on on kind of just getting out of debt and being on the same page in terms of our money I think that was really huge um you know just getting on the same page and also not being afraid of hard work\nUm you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like it you say that\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money a kind of like God look down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause\nYou know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors than we were able to pay off with a much quicker re a lot quicker than we thought because\nI didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just\n\n\n\n\nOh that then we bring in this idea of I'm going back to school to be a nurse which is an awesome goal or I'm not only will you be very employable you of the building make really good money and um and can really adjust your schedule\nIn crazy ways to really double your income if you want to for short periods of time I mean you've got all kinds of options in nursing that are going to be really good for you and your family [noise]\nUm so are we the return\nOn investment the investment into Austin is a really good investment\nBecause of your field of study you know you're not you're not getting a degree and left handed puppetry here this is actually a good degree and so\nIt's worth every penny you're spending on it and a bunch more is what I'm saying so if we're if our goal is to get out of debt so that we can build wealth than the first step of that before we start anything else to say no more new debt\nYou can't get out of debt while you're getting into debt that you can get out of holding out the bottom right so that means we got a cash flow college so what's ... what's going to cost\nA it's about three thousand dollars a semester and semesters\nA it's probably at least three years' worth of school\n... years three years of school so I'm thinking really twelve maybe\nSo you you didn't complete your undergrad already then\nNo I mean I'm I'm a baby in in college I I'm just now starting I mean it's a semester one I haven't you know this\nIs okay but you don't have an ... you don't have an undergrad under your belt that you're adding a nursing degree too right right okay so you got to finish up some undergrad or do some undergrad and then move into the writing so you need a three thousand a semester\nTimes three our our I'm Sorry ... for three years you said is where I was going to take you and so I was six thousand dollars a year for three years Eighteen thousand bucks right\nYeah something like that OK okay and what's your household income um ... it was about sixty thousand dollars and my wife were having our first baby next well in the beginning of November\nWhat's your household income during the next three years going to average\nProbably around forty to forty five thousand dollars whoa\nOkay so you're not gonna have a lot of cash to finish school and you have how much in savings\nOr twelve thousand okay ah I get\nThe hint that emergency fund fourteen thousand\nYour emergency fund a small yeah okay yeah I think your total money make over baby steps are on hold until we get college paid for\nOkay so I'm going to set the twelve thousand over in my college fund and it needs to be Eighteen as my very first gold and then when it gets to Eighteen then we can talk about building the\nUh you know we talk about taking the emergency fund down to a thousand and start working on the other day that's how much other data got not counting your house\nOr the car how much do you do on the car it's about twenty five thousand\nOh lord and you make forty five\nWell at that time we uh we made like I said I made about sixty sixty\nFive dollars an hour if you're going to be making forty five thousand this car does not fit in your goals for the next three years\nOkay mathematical insanity\nI mean look at look at these numbers we got an Eighteen thousand dollar a you know investment into Austin which we've agreed is a really good investment we we've got three thousand dollars to our name we've got a forty five thousand our household income\nAnd plenty of car no I Need to hear like five thousand dollar cars wanted me to hear\nOkay in the middle of this because cars not your goal right now your goal is get all this mess cleaned up and get your education on your belt and double your income which is what's gonna happen\nOkay agreed yeah so in a car okay\nGet you get you a much much much cheaper car so that you hit these goals because what you're doing is you're paying a price to when you're living like no one else so that later you get to live like no one else\nBut this car as it stands out as you had this have this really logical really smart a whole thing going on until we got to the car and then and we went to stupid land\nIt just it just sticks out it doesn't it doesn't fit in your equation it doesn't even fit in your life is like you all had a you know a really bad impulse one day and you know just went off the ranch or something I don't know but even if you're making sixty five it didn't fit it was ridiculous purchased so it's just way too high\nAnd even if you paid cash for it in all of the middle all this so it wouldn't have made sense so ... time to time to move that puppy and then let's live our lives because the good news is you'd rather than you want man 'cause your income is going to be eighty\nWhen you're finished with this and you're able to pay cash and\nYou know but you can't have these blockers in your way that you're trying to get around this elephant in the room that says car it it's the only thing killing you it's killing you plant it's it's it's just it's death so anyway that's what I Would do and I think you guys are really smart and I think you'll do it\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Doug is on Twitter is it normal to continually adjust my budget during the first month\nYes\nAnd it is okay to adjust your budget continually during the first month\nIf\nIt is not because you're out of control being immature and impulse sing if it is instead because you didn't estimate properly\nLike for instance you didn't have enough set aside for food\nAnd it wasn't because you went out to eat every night and you were a jerk it was because you just didn't have enough set aside for food you only had an unrealistic budget for food and you're discovering life looks different than your theory and you just that\nBut I have to continually adjust my budget so that I get to do whatever the flip I Want no that's not a good idea\nOr people will do that but that's not a good idea\nSo your budget is to give you a guideline but it takes about three months of doing your budget trial and error adjust trial experiment trial adjust experiment adjust experiment adjust to get a completely dialed in and the first month you're going to have we always laughing so you're gonna forty to emergency budget committee meetings\nBut those are to adjust only the things\nThat you miss estimated or you just forgot and it is something that's real and something as important it's not like oh we've been on a budget for two days and I'm like really tired of that I Want to go out to eat no that's not what I'm Talking about [noise] [noise]\nNo I just you know I'm really you know just this is really stressful I've been doing it for three hours now you know that's not what we're talking about we're talking about you just missed your food budget or you didn't want anything aside for car repairs and you think about and then you have a car repair jihad stopping adjust for that and pay for that\nAnd so yeah you gonna continually adjusting for three months you're first month the worst second month the next four\nMonths of work that's how it's going to play out\nTo address or your impulses list is today [noise]\n[noise] child ... show\nHearing the radio
