state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\nSo they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nYeah they have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have terminal life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nOne less you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car did you check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now they go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if

to high profile Democrats and the other\nAll right so here's the thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a force of your take home pay is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I had my four oh one K. back and you're pretty helpful a Gemini on this four oh one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is you're probably\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nBecause they're all going down in value shouldn't have toys stuff was wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on pay or fifty percent of your income now you did just cut your income down substantially when mom I came home I got that part but still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much tied up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably going to take your three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still gonna take a weapon on which way you sell but um you know I'm getting out of this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you number one number two I'm getting out of it even if it had benefitted you even if you got a fifty thousand dollar you're raised because of it I used that fifty thousand declare that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys\nOr no I Know I Would sell some toys but I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets and on your houses it's generally OK I'm temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone\nBut I Want you to do once you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep the around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice tied up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred thousand dollars were stuff's going to be worth fifty thousand about\nA blink of an eye and then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so\nYeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you thought we were going to show which was the house\nAnd you got surprised by me selling your toys but I you know whatever you want their toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way I'm a boat in a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about but that but the problem with all of it is it goes down in value\nAnd so it needs to be a small percentage of your world\nRob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\nKnow great Dane thank you so much for all the stuff you and your organization view um I've got a question I have traveled in the past the way of employment I've gone from jobs where I had to wear name K. two jobs that were possible careers to owning my own job\nAnd now I'm at a point where I'm starting a business and I wanted to be employee base but my question is for that new\nOne is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work I have people that I've had people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you are just doing all the work and honing your job I got ya okay right very great so now I'm In Atlanta now now I Hope to work on your business not just in it okay good\nRight [noise] and so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\nWell when your brand new one small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive and so um you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you they can buy health insurance cheaper than you can for them okay\nAnd so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what they want to wear the more they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nPolicy that kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without or twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate side benefits like treating them good\nAnd all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's

whole I fall asleep on all our family members\nI'm In the process of switching my wife and out of term insurance ... what do we do with our three kids whole life policies should we keep it as is change it to term or cancel it altogether cancel it altogether\nIf you need life insurance on the child it would only be enough for what we call final expenses God Forbid a funeral\n\nAnd ten Fifteen twenty thousand bucks as a child rider on your term policy would cover that if you want to cover that if you've got an emergency fund and within Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in it I Would self insured through that\nChildren we love them they're precious they're everything they do not create financial benefit\nWell most often\nI had a friend who had a kid a diaper commercial he created financial benefit but most of the time kids costs money they don't make money\nAnd so our goal is to take care of them not for their passing to take care of us\nAnd so the only cost you would want to cover it would be God Forbid and the event you lost a child would be a final expenses cost\nAnd you usually have an emergency fund if you're following our steps in Europe the baby step three to do that and you won't need to do that when you're switching your show I'm canceled a whole lot policies on kids they're sold to you as a college benefit but your child will never see the front door of a college using a whole lot of policy\nBecause there's I mean you just that they're going to be four dollars or something and that thing I mean it's ridiculous the little kid policies are just a complete rip off and for whatever you do don't buy financial stuff from a baby food company\nThose will be buying those Gerber policies I don't know who bonds and stuff I mean does that it just strikes me as funny than anybody would even consider buying a financial investment for my baby food company\nJust backward\nBut we're going to use them to feed our kids more ways than one [laughter]\nIs that what are you thinking so ... jump on a Zander insurances website get you some quotes on you and your wife and just drop the kids whole life policies completely\nAnd drop your whole life policies one Sanders issues your term policy which of the term policy in place you can get the best prices anywhere in the sand or insurance dot com because they're a broker they shop among a zillion companies\nAnd get you the best price Michael is with us in Lexington a Michael how are you\nHave you done\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm just a quick question I'm Twenty years old I Am not married I've completed babysit swollen into and I'm In the national guard right now I'm looking to deploy and a few months for the greater part next year and I'm Wondering I'm living at home for free now and I'm Wondering\nIf I should go and open up a retirement account and start contributing to that or if I should have a little bit more to fully on a number that you\nNeed an emergency fund everybody needs an emergency fund\nThe good news in your case as most of your emergency is will be covered by the fact that you know you're in what's known as a stable job [laughter] you're not going to like I mean you could lose that job it's possible but you'd have to really work at it and um it's not like they're not going to make payroll right\nSo um that part's okay but I mean other types of emergencies or the job loss can occur so yeah you need some money set aside as an emergency fund and then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away\nAnd um that would be baby step for and I do that first and a ... and then I Do it in Iraq the T S P after that if they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching on the ... going to start there with her off with a match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country buddy appreciate it's good to talk to you\nMartin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how does that\nWhile I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether I should tell my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and path any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars I'm a credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nYou got your your debt free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nUh trying to get their hands with some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere is an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is\nWith all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're in China traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow where to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yeah it's not a nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I own a margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we got to pay a price\nAnd he had to do that you're you're you're fighting\nAgainst you know a billion a cart into science you know billions of years of evolution right where we didn't do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know and but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really ...\n... who's gonna decide when robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nYou know on the surface of sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on it\nIt it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nHoward by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because he did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go\nYeah you know there was no one smokes you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you know the the goat champion and so\nIt's printed that writing is on the wall E N I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we boast about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... buttoned up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty five so yeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than right than we would have possibly the imagine so\nI like that the cushy Murphy app yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk\nAbout I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers\nNow how yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile then people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael Guillen lost to shoot you the numbers coming up in about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation and then it's open lines for the rest of the night\nCoast to coast am in for George ... this is Ian [noise]\n\nNot their current job you'll have your pick of the most qualified candidates for any position you have available we can help go to I haven't worked dot com that's I heart works dot com\nAnd they're typically coated in red light green light yellow light\nIn your home inspector feels like they've got to do a good job for you and they do and they show you all the stuff that's wrong with the house but the majority of the stuff\nIs like maintenance thing you can do stuff\n[noise] so I got a question for you yeah you're buying a house as is do you get home inspection\nAbsolutely and then why is it important to have a home inspection if you're buying a house that is to make sure there's no sense it makes you not want to buy it or yeah but you're buying it as is so it's\nNot the light your agent Saturday she rotten it up to say after my inspection period I'll accept it as a her\nChecked in your interest you're right you're angle she works for you and not the seller just checking what I mean the cell that might be trying to find something under the table right it doesn't preclude your\nChoice of having a home in the exactly as I said you either have to buy it as it or not\nThat's the people you're using you know to surround yourself with in the business I mean if I'm selling the house to somebody I never going to say oh you know they'd home inspection now that is not going to come out of my mouth ever\nKnow you always want to home inspection its its insurance you pay for it all the time whether it's car insurance life insurance homeowner's insurance you pay for insurance but the day you need it you want it and that's the way I view homeowners and a homo home inspection is like insurance\nYou out and almost ... almost like appraisals I think sometimes when you get ten home inspectors out there I think you're going to a different value about what they're going to offer\nSome yeah it for granted you know yet how do you choose a good one than well\nI mean there's I don't ever get this one guy I give you a list of sex or you know ... you know people have you know that I feel are ... um I trustworthy and have good integrity right you know the correct credential\nThan ever been up there when they're home inspect it sure yeah okay and so you kind of walking around making sure they're actually like I Love the way I got\nIt for the summary and kind of let them you know walk through with the buyers and they educate us on everything a lot of good things about the home inspection other than just what's wrong with the house is\nWhere's your you know where's your stuff where your water chef things you need to know if something goes wrong that otherwise you may not know that I mean some people are more savvy than others or you know they ... improvements and what not and some people have no clue so\nYou know that it's interesting you brought that up because I mean how many people really know where they're shut off up as in all that it happens all the time and then as soon as the moment comes up that you need to find it you have no clue where it's at\nYou know what I'll be looking in back in\nActually I learned to that I had somebody called me the other day and they turn their heat on which I'm sure this happened all over but they're like our aides not working downstairs and now I'm like working in their home and say okay it's gas did you turn on your dad but yeah I mean we figured it out but I bet a lot and I just got called when I got called\nIt it is something that gets overlooked but yet people discredit or think it's not no big deal but I mean\nIt's worth the extra four hundred and forty bucks whatever you're being charged for your home inspection and um [noise] I wouldn't do buy a home about it so hey we've got a job out to a break but uh [noise] we're going to get into some very interesting topics today\nAnd one is are we shifting from a seller's market to a buyer's market a lot of things are said about that a lot of people don't really understand what the differences between the two so\nWe're going to jump into that and kind of put that to bed and then also talk about the markets slowing down\nAs a following the appreciating what the market so [noise]\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the ac [noise]\nEighteen is turning out to be an entity weekdays do talk radio point three Fifteen W. L. A. [noise]\nHey we're going back to the money in my show here on TALK radio now point three in the end of the things they my fair and in Studio ... Mr Christopher both from uh midtown title and then ... brewer from been smart cruelty and [noise] what [noise]\nWhat's the sellers are buyer's market mean [noise] I mean that gets thrown around the media so many times people hear about all the time a nightly news and it's like a seller's market to buyer's market what what what defines a seller's a buyer's market\n[noise] well it means that it is favored to this or the ended on which side you're on true and we are somewhat in the seller's market but I think that is slightly shipping right now just a little bit I'm\nBack in just definition ... a seller's market would be when you're selling a house and the feller has the advantage over the buyer or vice versa\nAnd a lot of that stems back to the days I'm not today's market but the the inventory and ... ... National Association of real tours a show right now the current running a editorial four point three in a national level\nI don't know markets six months so if you got four point three months worth of supply and the market that means sellers can pretty much dictate what they want to do to some regard because there's not that many houses out there for sale and you've got more buyers out there looking\nFor the same house or a limited number of houses and therefore I mean it's just a native of yeah it creates the bidding war did you hear about it and everything else\nSo until we get to six months of him a toy it's going to remain a seller's market and what you're hearing some people say is\nDamage where it's coming up you know back in two thousand Seventeen it was four point one four point one month and okay so we've increased from four point one to four point three\nIt is the sky Arlen Ehlers market seller's best to general consensus yet and think\nAbout it this way man you use the analogy that we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show you're on the interstate highway whatever you call in years ... eighty five miles an hour and you're just getting it and all of a sudden you roll up on a cop and you look at the speed limit and you're like oh crap and twenty miles over you go back down to sixty five\nAnd now all of a sudden you feel like you're crawling along things are going by very very low fat right\nRight so we've just slow down a little bit in our appreciation yeah you know and and the market itself is cooler office attacks it's still a very healthy and positive market it's just slowed down some I don't look at it like in some\nYou know me but just barely moving that you can't even you know measure and you think it the world's fall in the sky fault\nI Would also like to point out I have multiple listings about to hit the market and every one of them I say\nWell is this the bad times now now I'm like you know I mean typically you know spring and summer when everyone thinks now than that I mean and that is the busiest time that the euro fell on a house but he goes on people still get transferred to eat at things still go on the difference is now\nMost people in the market if you're in the market to buy or sell you were motivated they're trying to find out how to sell your house\nWe always talk about on holidays you know it's a great time to lift your house even though people say it's not as ... who are in the market there there are areas you're not down just messing around them right in there out seriously trying to look at properties so that's\nI mean I read an offer like on Christmas Eve last year\nAnd you think about it I mean you hear about all these companies to relocate in the Nashville there's been tons of things on like the social media sites like Lincoln and so forth a hundred people a day and when you're being transferred in you don't exactly get to choose when you get transferred in I Will get transferred to Nashville year around so\nYou don't hear many people getting transferred out the no the kind of get here and stayed on to that kind of the draw Nashville man so\nThey'd have somebody relocating actually out of here out of here but they get like an opportunity in a lifetime when their job and\nThey go into the city now [laughter] telecommute\nThey're going to a smaller town that they're getting to open their own branch is when they ...\nMight not be able to buy or sell a house but rather Petra okay hey we've got about another break when we get back we're going to talk about a mortgage insurance and why I had preached in preached in preached in preached about you don't want mortgage\nInsurance but now you might want for because that's on the other side from the break villas in my show here on TALK radio not here for three and Fifteen tend to see\n\nI can go to a purple overall vehicle cannot go register online at all on that in our local ... or ... or what are up over time [noise]\nDuring early voting phones over and over I prefer a Volvo hangover harmful for\n\nA while back to the money man my show here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen then WNYC we talk all real estate goes there [noise] and we have a studio Chris ... from ... I don't and then ... and a jump into the conversation I Want to touch on one thing that I forgot to say in our last segment\nUm homes and the equity within the homes [noise] um [noise] ...\n... your [noise] your your equity is basically the the the ratio where the balance between the number of leans or the amount of leans do you have in your house so if you have a hundred thousand dollar mortgage\nAnd your house is worth two hundred thousand dollars than basically you got to ... percent ratio if ... percent of the ... is equity in the ... percent on the property value\nWell there's Thirteen point nine million properties in the U.S as a cue to court to of two thousand Eighteen that fit that model that fit that\nHit that benchmark fifty percent fifty percent equity\nOr the other for trillions of dollars of equity in the U. S. that people\nYeah and people don't realize how much equity they have sitting in their homes oh yeah I mean time I had time parts of the town\nWhere it I mean like oh yeah I can count hundreds of them\nYeah so that's our lack of him and tore 'cause people don't want to sell their homes or they don't want us to go ... and all that money on a new house and they're just going to sit and put so yes\nSo as you say that to set up one thing that a semi\nIf you're still paying him my mortgage insurance ... to refinance\nAnd if you're worried about the costs of refinancing we can position you're skipped two months' payments cover your costs to refinance and put you back where your principal balance was before the ... and now you're ... you're in my and if you keep on paying what you're paying right now you're going to pay off the house off even faster\nMhm what would people not\nI don't know I mean I was just going to sound really bad I'm so sorry I'm so sorry everybody fire\nPeople would you not ... I mean I guess people just don't know that they can get that off of there at that point a threat didn't that fifty percent loan to value wouldn't I mean because the first thing come to my mind is\nI'm so sick of paying this stuff why can't I get it when can I get it off my loans when I'm paid anymore I just don't know that I Would have ... why would wait till fifty percent\nTo get to that point so is it a is there just ... when the first hand in it Seventy or eighty well we're we're we're getting ready to jump into all that but I'm just wondering what might be what the mindset would be if it's just lack of knowledge on or or have somebody forgot about it or or what do you think that driving factor is its\nLack of knowledge I think lack of knowledge it's a combination of lack of knowledge um you basically pay your mortgage every month to forget about it it's just like your homeowner's insurance you almost insurance increases by twenty five per se I'm twenty five dollars [noise]\nUh well ... and that extra you know that I Am and you just kind of forget about it it's out of sight outta mind everything could set up an auto payments and you're not looking at the actual statements you just pay it\nWell there's plenty parts of national we have talked about that continually has double digit price increases value increases year after year here we've seen it we we know it and so if somebody even if they borrowed the maximum that could borrow one house when they purchase it whether it's Ninety seven Ninety five percent\nI mean at a double double digit increase I mean they'd be out of the threshold\nQuick really us yeah\nAnd and then that comes into the whole mindset will it's going to cost me ... how much I'm really going to gain and they'd I hear so many times people say if you points less or so that I Am and I'm like that drives me nuts and I'm like look and so many people don't understand this and lenders don't use the amortization schedules and you plug in\nTo the images Asian scheduled shows exactly how much of your payment your pain every month is going towards the principal interest period\nAnd you can set up an amber does Asian schedule that shows what you're paying now how much is going towards principle how much is going to be going the principal on payment two hundred and fifty six and how much is a lot of interest it'll show you the entire thing if you can read your bank statement you can read this and we simply turn around and put a new amortization goes right by ms okay if you re fi\nHere's what you're looking at and now it's it doesn't you don't have to listen to me and take my word for it to do I think it makes sense or not the numbers are right there they don't mind\nThe cold thing you've talked about before which I Love is that you know you always have to be make up less of a payment you could always even reduce your term yeah I mean maybe you're just you're okay with making that pain that you know and you could show people how hey\nJust keep making the same payment knock five years six years and years off you're alone to ah to do this and that gets you all paid off a whole lot quicker so to me if I'm used to making the payment I just want to get a goal ... so\nWe don't realize how deep it doesn't matter if it's a hundred thousand dollars a million dollar twenty five bucks extra month it adds up oh yeah it adds up the lower you pay that principal now the less amount there is less amount there is this a centrist\nIs and then you pay interest on that balance ... where you're paying it down with less money the bank it's at the end of the day you know people always talk about that we used to have the truth and lending form which had that big old nasty number on it that showed amateur total payment was over the course of the loan which it was a you know everybody's like one way or whatever amount\nTo you know but we we still have that number in the last page with the closing disclosure and it's and it's in a real ... and you know and they hide it it it's a ... but it's still on there I can assure you yeah and it shows you what the total number is ... and people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
