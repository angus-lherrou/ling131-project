Ramsey show\nHang day thanks so much for taking my call\nSure how can I help\nSo I have a question not as much right now but for my parents my husband and I were introduced to Pierre and\nAbsolutely love that and we are just because they can to and we have a longer plan with a whole bunch of student loan that we're just trying to ... and how they're going to take a few years and I did see my parents thinking and that's horrible head of the fair\nAnd being completely broke and overwhelmed and jets or thing or have at the end though I just calling for advice on how how I can influence them because they really like and fight for their can even in my thirties now it doesn't matter it's like I'm Still again\nAnd it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder dry but they don't really want your opinion\nAbout rank about money or sex okay and so the only time that reverses when they get really really really old and as an adult yeah yeah but um that you generally doesn't happen and so it you know it's like a friend that's being obstinate\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown\nAnd they're being obstinate about something and you just have to watch somebody that you love do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend that's an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't quit drinking\nI mean you know I ... and I've talked to him and people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pasture that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your\nStory mhm mom we were ... mom we were freaked out ... we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nAnd if you do have to go heavy on somebody a little bit uh just blame it on may ... you just said OK and just go you know you can argue with David you argue a day but you know he got so many people out of that I don't think you did sure\nSo um you know whatever you may not be that abrasive but you don't want to talk right but the point is you can go got bad guy they call it off on me a and lean on that and so\nLike when ... first start speaking um I mean she was twenty four years old I mean I'm not sure what she thought sure [laughter]\nNow she's twenty eight and had three ... three national bestsellers and now a few people cares what you're doing the right side of it but she has blamed it on me\nOr if we're in a Christian setting we blame it on the Bible okay you know this is what the Bible says the Bible says the borrower slave with the lender and you want to argue with that how you got yeah and the Bible you know Jesus said don't build a power that first counting the costs less to get halfway up and you're able finished and obviously you begin to mock you and say this man began to build and was unable to finish\nSo you should be on a written plan is what Jesus was saying so\nReally I mean I get up with him I mean you know a ... that kind of stuff now again I'm being sarcastic and bombastic he would be I Would even be more gentle than that in a setting in a smaller setting okay\nThe bigger the setting the more wild I Am about the uh but you know when you're one on one you're just gentle and you just go guys I'm only thirty one I don't have all the answers but here's what we did know and you know if you want to have those same results I suspect if you do the same thing we did\nYou'd have the same results we didn't have those results because of our age we had those results because we applied proven principles\nRight you know I mean let's let's say that you are leading up let's say you were a personal trainer\nAnd the guy you were training uh was four hundred pounds\nAnd he was a forty five years old\nBut he doesn't like you're telling him anything 'cause you're thirty one and you have ...\nI mean come on you know it was a personal trainer you got out she got up yeah so I mean he may have he's got to ... you know you just you just kind of this is what you're doing my point is you have proof but but you just approach it with the same spirit you approach this question wealth okay and that's just a a level of humility\nUh but you can be\nForceful on the principles\nAnd on the scripture as the backup for the principles and even on the day Ramsey or Dave Ramsey organization her brand or whatever as proof of the principles and\nYour personal life as proof for the principles and if they don't get it through all of that because you're thirty one they're just using that as an excuse\nBut again you don't want be abrasive but you're not going to be you wouldn't even asked this question if you were going to be a brace right and it's just not your style it's who you guys are okay but do really you've got great story\nThank you and you just tell your story yeah Scott this what we did I mean you do what you want it but this is what we do right and they look what happened you know I lost three hundred pounds if you do the set ups and donate to smooth this is what happened you know\nAnd it's applied the principals and as I say thank you so much for teaching a class no thank you so cool that you're doing that yeah I'm excited and you know what's what you'll find is interesting is\nThat people don't look down on age when there are results mhm okay it's when you have no proof\nIn your life or you know that that you know that they look down and they go look I got socks older than you\nYou know and they you know that they will but but that's what you got us or you're who they wish they had been when they were thirty right you know and and so they can still be that when they're sixty if they'll go do it as a great question man thanks for joining us thanks for coming by and thanks for teaching the clash Haley is with us in Seattle, Washington Hi Hailey how are you\n[noise] if I'm ... I had a question concerning at timecom plan\n\nAm I have plenty out there and play or in a retirement\nAnd and I know you talk about pulling it out and putting it or not pulling it out but transferring from Utah fun good I went to a guy in our church he worked for a drive in financial and he does say that he college jail\nAnd and so I I'm Sorry I Need the ... well he was the fact that we put money into variable annuity rather than mutual fund mhm and I wasn't sure why or if that was okay our topic you're following\nYou and I did not following you know what is not following what I teach I'm ... I didn't think about the answer that part of the question\nVariable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment in the annuity is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion nor did you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the annuity coat wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the annuity coke do for you the coke wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's an an IRA already Dutch so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay then you move it into a new the inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity we'll give you is they'll give you some guarantees\nA along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds when you're young you don't need those guarantees so I'm\nOkay and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving her friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual funds sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to show you that because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that is a way they can make such a way in insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities license\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a very ... about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make more on them and I would not accused\nThe chicken or guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not scared he's latch that's my guess okay and and it really is you can use still giving you a bad recommendation\nNow he did say that I can do that and you're trying to find exactly as you recommend and has using him he just really pushing the variable annuity and asked me to go home with all the number at my husband review and think about that Mm well I wanted to call you immediately I knew what you are going to say already\nYou know so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by that you don't know is\nBad I you're right and that can go and I I had a lesson\nThat might that right away I just felt bad 'cause he goes to our church and that you know network\nYeah no that's okay I mean is that you don't have to do business with people at church is not necessary so and so I I I don't think I'm going to do business with this guy um\nBecause I mean I I mean I I don't like his advice and I might not like it next time when I might not understand next time so I'll just get a smart\nRestaurant row and moving that way is a series of gross army troops on the red cross\nThanks for the call and this is that Iran she shows the\nProduction officer for the date rape you show\nShow these days my\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this was the last time you checked on your financial plant\nYou heard me or do you even have one\nI listened with a financial plan and blaze you're more likely to reach your investment goals and the best place to start is by sitting down and talking with an investing professional\nOur smart vest her program helps you quickly find the only professionals in your area that our team personally works with and look on oh meeting with a broken feel intimidating especially if you don't even know what to ask them\nThat's why we created an interview God with a list of questions you can print and bring with you to make your conversation stress free to download your guide to go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash questions to ask Dave Ramsey dot com slash questions to ask\nFrom the plumbing and electrical broadcasts better this is talk radio not boy three on tell me what I Do ten Fifteen ten WINZ\nNashville heart radio station\nSuspicious behavior ...

know you do a good job of a screening them vetting them before you come in and you know you're kind to them but you're from with them they're going to pay your you have to move 'em out and you do all that kinda stuff real estate and making good money\nUh especially paid for real estate it's very very nice I got a bunch of it [laughter] but if you don't want to do with all that and I just get I Would pick some good mutual funds and go that way\nBut at the point is there's no shame and your game by keeping it simple\nSomehow people have the idea that primitive or simple is bad\nAnd the contrary to the contrary is it the truth is the contrary to that the truth is is that the typical person who builds a net worth of up to about ten million dollars a does keep it ...\nThey clean and very very simple Sarah is with us in all uh Seattle, Washington Hi Sarah how are you\n[noise] I'm doing well thank you Kelly is taking my call\nWell we'll let Kelly answer your question if you want now [laughter] what sub Sarah\n[laughter] um I'm trying to get a little bit of advice and how to advise my parents to get long term care insurance\nMy daddy sixty seven and doesn't qualify him some health issues and my mom just turned sixty a couple of months ago a couple of months ago and we're talking and my dad says well\nNo amount for the insurance doesn't fit in our budget and with my mom says that short term thinking ... and I'm thinking that you need at the budget\nWatcher how income [noise] um [noise] well that's a good question they are retired missionary so they have not made it on and my dad is now retired and my mom works at the reception is I don't know is\nThere may not fit in their budget okay I\nMean there may have to buy very very limited policy if they don't have hardly any income why what's wrong with your dad that he doesn't qualify\n[noise] um he has made us have had a kidney transplant candidate\nAnd so he is attempting to get it in the past and hasn't been able to\nSome I've tried to do what you said the Potter by sending them off her or whatever you know say you know what works for me but try to stay out of\n... really doesn't get to go when I get too much into that now but apparently um like last year I encourage them to look into it and they talked about ... ... that they couldn't qualify at that point so\nSo if you if you can't talk about this what are they gonna do it or not I mean how can I help\n[noise] well my mom called me and told me all day so I think she's on board of trying I guess my question is um [noise] how can I ask how to convince them that it's an important [laughter] you know like\nYour mom already knows it's important not only question is I don't know if they'll get the money to buy much of a policy sounds like they're pretty broke too many\nUm what what you're describing I don't know I mean some people come off and mission field ... broke but but sometimes they don't and so you just got to you know um it it sounds like you're trying to fix something a lot harder and they're trying to fix it you can't make them do this\nAnd so I think your your mom's question and yeah I mean if there's any way I could get it into my budget I Would get it into my budget\nUm but it sounds like his health and he's an older than her about Fifteen Years and he's er no I'm Sorry about seven years you're saying but I'm\nIn

L. A. the\nOf Ramsey solutions B and C R where the guys how are you\nGoing to say welcome where are you from\nIllinois near him oh very\nGood welcome to Nashville and all the way here to do your debt free scream yes I Love it how much of it paid off two hundred and Seventy five thousand wow how long did that take six and a half years good for you and your range of income during that time\nWe started out about a hundred and eight hundred thousand and now we're just over a hundred and Seventy thousand cool I'll do for a living and an assistant professor mhm\nAnd I'm a shot manager about auto body shop\nVery good cool cool so I'm guessing with the size of that that end up being six and a half years you're paid off your house yes I did\nA pretty good job of you guys well done well done very cool so that's house and everything you got no payments in the world right how's that feel awesome not bad\nSo tell me the story what happened six and a half years ago they put you on this journey\nWell my sister in law was telling me about the financial peace university class he was attending and she was telling us about budgeting and hang out credit card and I kinda just pass\nIt off at the time because we already followed a budget and then I catch it on the radio show a few weeks after that and\nUm I really liked her no excuse attitude for paying off debt so I came home and suggested they told me that we should go to a total money make over one day event and so we did that and we decided to give it a try and so we were\nWas that have been held Kansas City okay very cool very cool and I got you guys going there\nNo we started to do that and we finished babysat Caitlin three ... and we had just finished baby steps three in October two thousand and twelve and then just a few weeks after that our entire world kind of fell apart\nAnd when he was diagnosed with foreign brain tumors whoa\nSo at that time we went into survival mode for\nYears while he was in and out of the hospital having surgery um during that time we also passionate about Fifteen to twenty thousand dollars mhm and medical debt and medical bills mhm and we also made the difficult decision to sell the family business or cause that at the time and so we liquidated that\nAnd we got about fifty thousand dollars to not fail\nAfter he was back in good health and working full time we sat down and looked at our budget how much we had to pay off on the house and we just knew we had to finish it with his health history so we just made the commitment and kept moving forward\nWhile she'll go ahead and just be brain tumors in the process yeah\nGood for you and thank you well dont man that is awesome is going to do that without these yes I'll bet I bet you guys are fall through some real stuff and paid off out while you're at it I Believe it was\nVery very cool well life does happen while we're more we're making other plans doesn't it and uh you you just push pause for a little while and took care of business and then push play again right\nRight so good for you what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nA hard work and perseverance this discipline mhm\nAre disappointed he's pointing at her for that I Can't see through your radio yeah very cool great ... and so you've got a the line up with your the kid knows whether you give me their names and I just\nWe have Kelly sixteen ... they Megan will be Fifteen next week mhm Carmen is ten and Taylor seven\nVery cool so ah the ghettos and and they've struggled through this whole thing too with you obviously they asked they learn anything in the process\nI think so I Hope so [laughter] good okay well congratulations you guys are very proud of in congratulations on beating the brain tumor in man that's an incredible story thank you very cool and I hear your set with a paid for house yeah what's that thing worse\nI it's probably three fifty to three eighty\nBearing not union edits years so [laughter] it's years by the way nobody's going to get that one no it sure is I Love it the that's a different feeling\nBugs that I've never been there it's a different feeling after you've been through stuff like you guys have been through or German and I went through losing everything and nobody's coming into my house\nIt's my it's paid for very well done you guys very well done we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired\nNumber one bestseller that should be the next chapter in your story millionaire status to what we're going for next and outrageously generous along the way so congratulations you guys thinking like you don't have the girls been practicing the death prescribed they have the younger the only way I okay because the teenagers or to go yeah yeah okay\nWell I think you're already preparing yourself for your financial futures Seventeen years old you actually know the day for him to show exist go figure\nSo I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game of most people say you know what to do and\nAnd and you're obviously observe some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good things not necessarily the money but but and he's probably got some good traits that you didn't really Kate and carry forward\nUm so uh um\nWell the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of debt you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term you don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get credit cards and carry them around and so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're gonna have to handle your own a school\nAh and you know on the show you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine\nAs far as you go now as far as him on there's not many\nMen on the planet that will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son\n[laughter] absolutely\nYou have the powder bud syndrome once someone has powder but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex [laughter] and so he's probably not looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong uh so you're probably not the man to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\nShow what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um one is is there a person in his life uh particularly another man that he respects is their\nBusiness ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\nA well definitely our pastor in the past there have tried helping them in the past but it seems like no matter who's talking to 'em or what or how they're trying to help him he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of that and he's very stubborn and being his own man\nMhm okay well I think if I were you ever talk to your pasture again\nYou know I I find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I found people every day who\nTwo years ago weren't wouldn't listen but now they list a five years ago they wouldn't listen but now that listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but if the past or you know just a leans in and and I think\nI'm most pastures if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her pasture to turn up the heat is just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and push on your data on this subject\nAnd not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved\nYou can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut down you're not gonna do anything but make things worse very true yeah because he's going to go he's going to do whatever he wants to do\nAnd then you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over book or something you can do that but you can't be real\nI was thinking about doing that for like Christmas or something I think I Would just say this summer and I read\nThat I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like business or something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat\nThat doesn't work right that's insulting yeah fall on me and so you know instead you would just say are just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal that it would change my life I Would feel so good if you've read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust you know it's kind of keep it nonchalant just go hey I read this I thought you might like it 'cause you like business stuff or something like ... and and just see if he picks it up he may throw", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "24"}
