thought I Am actually reading the wind your daughter\nRowan here here's the rule of thumb okay when you buy stuff that goes down in value you don't\nGet rich [laughter] even even like when you buy a whole lot that goes down in value you get really on rich\n[laughter] yeah that's where you are you bought too much crap so you want to keep the travel trailer ... thirty thousand dollar car\nGet your car and pay cash probably the travel trailer off you have too much tied up and things that are going to be worth half of what they're worth today in two years and then there's\nMore than ... than that yeah hold on the head of foul that try and he you know yeah I don't I don't care there no matter to me you\nDon't you have to do whatever you want to call me though and asked me what I think you ought to do I think you are things that go up in value not tied up all your money and things that go down in value I don't mind you're having a decent car and having a travel travel trailer but given a hundred and forty thousand dollar income eighty thousand dollars is gonna be worth forty thousand dollars in two years is called stupid\nOkay your turn to the state or what what about what about trying to pay that travel trailer doesn't change the equation that I'm\nStill gonna be worth eighty thousand your turn into forty thousand and two years even if it's ... you must pay for it and I wouldn't use my retirement to finance my stupid\n'cause that's what you're doing and no no absolutely not so here's the thing you guys can do whatever you wonder if I woke up in your shoes having coached more people into wealth and out of debt than anybody else on this planet but what I Do I Would sell something\nA car or a trailer and I don't care which one which one do you like more your luggage truck more I mean he dropped ten thousand our truck the difference ten thousand our truck dirty dozen trucks not much\nReally not I got both of them sitting around here somewhere but it it's just not that much and so I don't care if the trailers if your children's entire psyche is wrapped around the fact that I get to stay in the trailer occasionally and you want to really pour into the children\nAnd the children the children the children the children the children the children the children the children the children the children's children there's so much truck\nOr if maybe we figure out tent camping is just as much fun or more fun for the good there's not much fun for you [noise] um\nAnd it's not twenty seven thousand dollars cash tours Seventy dollars you might wanna go that route for the children I don't know above but wants to keep his truck I'm finally the white but its amassing kid you're not going to get rich on and stuff goes down in value Brian is with us in Destin, Florida Hi Brian how are you\n[noise] ah [noise]\nAh we're gonna have to get your phone fix what's the problem with it [laughter] I'm like oh yeah that's saying what am I talking to it okay try that\n[laughter] Hi how you doing today they have good how can I help\nUm I had a good problem that I ran into the um my statement I when I was Nineteen I was in the navy and I got a wonderful all at once and I had a late in life are told me to invest it\nBack in Nineteen and when I did that I put a hundred dollars a month and while the navy for four years while I forgot about it\nAnd that therefore on now only two and we were going to start trying to get out of debt\nAnd found the state and if I look it up now or one point three million dollars and I didn't know what the act that book at regular each will not a requirement\nWow wow\nAnd you're not a tax you've not pay taxes on the growth all these years\nI have not and I've already contacted the company and got all the the first in a letter lap pointing and they are all all\nThe way or the first time you have is there's two kinds of two kinds of growth in a mutual fund there's dividends are that are reinvest and which are tax\nEach year and then there's just the growth of the value of the stocks that is not taxable until you cash it out but you have twenty two years have been accurate tax returns\nYeah that elaborate but I've already contacted my ... to figure out how to correct it could cost so much data got um I've got fourteen thousand dollars which is going to be paid off and oh come on and we get to that as yet\nAre absolutely yeah and so here's what I Would do I get the tax advice you're going to follow emitted returns back however many years to be three or five years they don't they won't take you back all twenty two years and you're going to file so some of this money is going to go to taxes but it's not going to be a time and then as you cash it out\nA some portion of what your cash out will become taxable because there's some portion of that has been growth but it'll be taxable with Fifteen Percent on a capital gains right so that's a very very tax advantageous\nSituation for a very good so get the tax advice which are doing on your ... your back returns and on what your of liability there is an your liability if you were to use some of the money you all do you own a mortgage\nMoaning

I'm slow down and then in March I was listening trying to figure out what to do I was thinking I Need another job and you told somebody on the radio you got to deliver pizzas and I said okay I think I can do that and the\nNights I'm not working I also had other part time job but I could work a second part time job and the nights and weekends and that's what I did I went in on a Wednesday and are way down at a Saturday and by Wednesday I was delivering pizzas while and I did that um for sixteen and a half months and I you know where\nEvery uh most days I worked at least two jobs if I was working one job it was kind of a vacation I'm I don't think I ever did three and and at once but I worked a lot\nUm so I\nAnd I'm so it paid off my car really quickly uh start at 'em and then I had student loans and my credit card and then I Am this past march I got five thousand dollars\nI'm forgetting um for my student loans because I teach um and it had a one school and the balance on my student loans was than seven hundred and\nEighty three dollars I Love and I paid it off the next week and I thought that was the best feeling and then it was march of this year and a June was coming up for my birthday and I was really afraid it wasn't going to happen I talk myself it's gonna it's gonna be okay if you don't you're not that three by your birthday\nIs going to be okay you'll do it

start my emergency fund going but I just kept\nWhat was your best month deliver which I'm\nFirm pitch 'em about\nI think it was about twelve twelve hundred dollars I made about in the Fifteen or sixteen months I made about twenty thousand over twenty thousand dollars of pizzas or current and how many not sure where um four to five times a week and basically you know I'm\nA treasure every thing though that extra extra twenty grand or when you're putting all thirty one thousand dollars and voted three months which will be built\nIt that that made a big that made a huge difference making the focus on you know um and all that extra money the my other\nMy hard work and that's a lot I mean you were gone all the time you know life you were just working\nI had no life I was it worth it it was so that my friends would ask me to do stuff\nAnd I would say well I Can't I'm no fun right now I'm going to be fun here soon again to comment\nBut they were all really supportive of phone what no one else you're going to be able to\nYes and just you know they um just deliver in all those pizzas and the snow and in the rain and\nWow we will get you yeah I Love it go so proud of you thank you I read your people sharing your own\nI did um a lot of my family did but especially my mom who's here with me today showing mom um she has been my biggest cheerleader she was the person who would say I was calling me along the way to do this and she's like no you can't do that like what I Want when I got tired in a larger accountability county hunter I biggest cheerleader that person that would\n\nI I I Would say you interfering is going to have a low probability of them changing\n\nA very low probability now if they ask you\nYour opinion ... now that's starting to say that they're starting to recognize that there's something wrong but right now none of them think anything is wrong with all this craziness and it's crazy your main is what it is unbelievable dysfunction\nBut I guess you could just sit down and said mom you know enablers are the nicest people that you'll ever meet mom you're one of them you're a nice person nice you're so nice you cannot say no\nYou're so nice that you think about doing things for my sister or that you're doing her favor and the actual truth as enablers are not nice people because we actually bring harm to the people that they're enabling because they are enabling they're causing them they're helping them to do things that are bad\nAnd doing things you know not being a fully functioning self supporting adult to thirty eight years old is a bad thing and to enable that to cause that to occur you you've done harm to your daughter\nIf you're listening to me in Europe thirty eight year old living in your house that has been there for a long time and you're buying them cars on unless they're mentally deficient in some way\n\nYou are doing them great harm because they have not they've never had to grow the strength of character to stand on their own and when you die they're going to be up a creek\n\nI mean you built out a trust fund baby here while you were still alive is what you did oh so awful\nDan's with us in Charlotte Hi Dan welcome to the ...\nHow are you doing today better than I deserve sir how can I help you\nGet to hear I actually I have I'm twenty five years old I'm when I was born I think three months after I was born my family gave me theory\nOn mhm I'm I'm Adam everything they\nTotal about four thousand dollars as of march ... double check to the I mean I'm kind of sit down and do it but I was curious on your opinion what should I cashed\nIn and get liquid immediately them 'cause they're immediately even though their interest rate is ... percent on\nYeah but don't you have do you have a pet at all\nNo no I'm actually graduating college ah luckily with no debt my parents helped me and I I I'm\nGood how do you have do you have a um your emergency fund built of three to six months of expense was\nActually just took a hit on my truck or a water park ... okay\nOh we didn't do that more to use this money to make sure you had an emergency fund once you've done that is there is any of it left I Would start investing\nAnd move on to what we call baby step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement so but yeah they're they're not\nIt's not a great place to park money long term and is not a great place to park on the short term either one so I don't use savings bonds for anything Jesse is with us from Fargo North Dakota Hi Jessie how are you\nAsking how are you good how can I help\nSo [noise] I'm debt free other than my house uh about two months ago a good my for my car is worth six thousand dollars and the engine just went out on a couple of days ago ...\nNot good so I I have a thousand dollars in my emergency fund right now mhm I'm my I'm deciding do I go out and buy a seven thousand our vehicle or do I spend a three to four thousand dollars to fix my current vehicle mhm Mm\nOkay well the car is probably worth a thousand dollars is it\nSets salvage right correct [noise]\nAnd so if you can spend two thousand on it the big kind a like spending three 'cause you could have got one for it put two ended his words and then you could sell it for six even if you were going to turn around and sell it if you can get it running for two\nThat's probably what I Would do much north of that and start to think about it but I mean that you know you're going to lose five thousand dollars now or you're going to lose two thousand dollars by fixing it and selling it for six you follow me\nWhen you write\nSo I'm probably fixing fixing it wasn't old used engine what what happened to the engine\n[noise] um [noise] he ... the mechanics said that there's something\nBroke and ... and he doesn't know why it just I was driving it and it and just started coloring and wouldn't going where\nOkay you need a new mechanic\n'cause I Need to know what's wrong with the car I mean something broken it will do kidding\nIn the engine coming in I I Know I don't know whether there\nI Know you don't know what it is but mechanic ought to be able to tell what it is I mean it had dropped or odd that means that blew it it's what we can all blown engine and in that case you're probably going to buy used engine from a junk yard and have someone put it in there and you probably do that for a couple of ground what kind of car is\nIt's a four to four ... four\nOkay I mean you could burn a vow of or something and that might be six hundred eight hundred bucks to fix it\nYou know he he said he said it blew the engine\nYeah but he don't even know what it is you're sad right\nYeah I a union another opinion dirty and find out what happened to Ted gum car but anyway the worst case scenario is you put a used engine from a junk yard in there for a couple of ... and you sell a car\nFor six foot six in your pocket I\nManaged to that you've taken out of your emergency fun and then you put some money with that and move up in car a little bit but you're probably going to repair this car before you shout ... probably go make more money on it that way\nOr even net of an engine but not not above five thousand dollar in genetic two thousand dollar engine so again a six thousand dollar car does not get a brand new engine in it\nYou put a huge change in from a shower

I'd like trying to ah\nContinue to do it the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay\nYou like your ideal thing you build one or two and your garage and you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the ideal works than what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order that just plays a deposit with large enough\nTo build the order\n... and it finds itself that's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\nDo you think I should dial down my rather than just an all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and my student loan debt\nI don't really get much capital on this you've already you already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right [noise]\nWell I keep it in that but I I just see I'm a protection is I Want it to be you know a good good looking counted\nThat's another ... there are no protections [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap this broken [laughter]\nYou're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes informants function changes in the ... which has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this is to that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ...\nI'm ... and then they give you enough money\nIn their deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nAnd basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and your sweat\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the morale of\nThe way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production or something proven into the marketplace or the actual production\nWay

...\nVery cool good for you guys welcome very good so tell me the story what happened thirty nine months ago they put you on this journey\nWell not four years ago we were getting ready to get married yeah eight and that so we had to ask and she'll talk and we realize that we thought had about the same amount of\nAnd going into a marriage and salary and we knew that that would limit our options and in life you know we wanted to move somewhere or you know such jobs things like that and so we knew we wanted to be that free but we didn't know how ... that was only knew at that point and\nAnd leave at ... at that you really normal and it's just part of being an adult and we didn't know it was possible and that\nA few months later and we got married and we had a few people mention\nA Ramsey and financial you've seen every city in passing and we didn't really find a lot of weight like okay that's coal and ... pounds complicated no thanks [laughter] and and then I was out at ... night she had her wallet with her and I made fun of her and I was like how your weight is huge having hearings\nAnd she's hell you know my envelopes are in there and so I finally had to think OK sign explain what this envelope deal is to me because I've been hearing it and know what it's about\nAnd so she told me about your podcast and I listened on my way home and I you know it just kept listening and I finally talked about it and I said you know there's I I ... I mentioned to me a few times and it looks like he has\nA financial plan and tired of that is getting out of that and maybe that's something that we need to like entail mhm and I was about a month after we got married and a month after that we started our first I\nHadn't been to ... and so I didn't know he was supposed to participate in that and how I did the budget on my own and I presented it to him and I said you know if you're willing to do that the life and and I was like if you're willing to I Need you to sign\nThis made me stop you already did it they\nMay any sign is contract yeah yeah she knew you know I I was cautiously optimistic yeah um because\nAgain I had kind of lost that hope of I Would ever be out of debt I remember going up thinking praying like man it'd be nice to just be zero again you know starting a zero\nBut she made me sign it and I was like are just going to be like a a diet fat you know the next fad for a diet you get on it for two or three weeks and next thing and you know you get back to eat and\nUm so she made me sign it and you know I stuck to it you know if I put my name or something yeah I got a deal yeah big deal that's that's my name that's my word is my bond\n... just a temporary thing it's not that I don't like you investing in your four one K. when you get to by being there for you easily with no payments in the world except the house payment can put Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement but the problem is you're delaying how long you get there and here's what happens\nThe things that we focus on in our life\nAre the things we're good at are you married\n[noise] no I'm Single I Am twenty nine years old\nOkay are you dating [noise] yes I'm Serious relationship\nYeah I've been married for three years in actually trying to make next that you know it can go next year or so\nOkay so have you noticed that while you're in this stage of you're dating how focused you are on her\n[laughter] see what you focus on you're good at have you noticed that [laughter] that is true yeah\nAnd and so you know ... is ... and it's our behavior saying it's a psychological thing it's a spiritual thing it's an emotional thing and that is is that ... and so it's more that's more of the reason to stop the investing in the math\nTen percent that you're putting in is not going to cause you to get out of debt that much faster but what does is when you're like all in\nA mall and like you are with her you're all in ... you're all in okay you're focused you're concentrating\nAnd and that's that's what we want you to do with the debt here for a short period of time I want you to be all and I'm not doing anything I have no life um focus I'm working extra I'm selling stuff I'm not doing anything ... beans and rice rice and beans I'm getting out of it OK\nThan when can I Swear at you out of that that that's what gets me ... more than the mathematical manipulation so that's what's important about temporarily stopping you're investing when you're in baby step too and that's why we suggest that\nHold on I'll have Kelly pick up will send you a copy of the book the total money make over\nAnd it'll help explain that a little bit further for you\nThan a is with us in Sioux City Iowa how do they how are you\nHide eight and a huge fan I think that you and your name and talking to people that my name's that costs were on to [laughter] ... I'm Sorry how can I help\nI'm calling about my um my youngest brother he's Twenty years old and four years ago he was hit from behind a highway speeds ... my parents are going into litigation far what his future will be like um\nKids in a job training program kinda just learning basic skills like how much and you know big groceries things like that\nSo many and I got a brain in an area that's yeah I hear that\nA brain injury a lot of memory is huge and impulsivity and so I'm not really sure how cute you know my dad asked me to do some research and I was like well I don't call Dave and she like he would say about 'em is legal stuff as far as hot as secure as a future for Danielle and he'll be taking care of\n... I'm Sorry what a sad situation I assume they have an attorney right thank you yeah\nMhm and they've assessed the ability to ah that that the person they hit them had insurance hand or assets that make it worth chasing them around right\n[noise] yeah it's been a long process over four years just kind of thing what would happen with Daniel or that timeframe they know that the effects of this accident\nWell there's a\nI mean there there's not a magic thing but a a a good attorney in this situation should be able to help you run the numbers out\nThat basically has a you know the ... this accident has taken away his earning ability for the next sixty years mhm that's a very expensive thing that he is lost that they need to pay him for\nMillions and millions of dollars mhm it is what he would have learned in his working lifetime has now gone\nYeah and so to offset that due to the accident is the liability of the person that caused the accident and you don't have to be an attorney to know that okay and so the calculation of that I'm ... and ... you know could we get a big enough lump sum that it that a lump sum invested\nCauses a you know Daniels income to never be a problem again mhm and so if you take a million dollars and invest it and then you know as an eighty thousand two hundred thousand dollar income the rest of his life\nAs an example you see what I'm saying\nAnd um and that's probably not enough but I mean that's that's a ... that's an example of a calculation to offset what he would have potentially earned in his working lifetime because that was stolen from\nHim because of this accident\nAnd uh I'm not being angry towards the person that I have no idea of the conditions of the accident but that's just the liability that that person and their insurance company has as ... as a result of law okay and your attorney's already told you all of that that's a basic thing it's like business law one on one okay the very first movie learns I kind of stuff so [noise] um\nYou know once you do that then you're saying we were replacing his lost income and certainly then medical bills in addition to that\nAnd uh and medical bills would include any kind of job training we can do to help him have a quality life skill or you know anything we do increases quality of life going forward right\nBut there's not a magic number to figure this out is just a there there's a calculation you can do to estimate these things and you know all of those things added to gather makes the\nUh you know the the settlement negotiation with the insurance company go on now they may be in there probably is um limits to the insurance coverage\nAnd there are limits not to the liability but to the assets that the person has let's say this person had basically no money\nAnd the insurance companies on the hook for half a million dollars you negotiate the rest of your life and you're not getting more and a half million dollars 'cause guys broke and you can't get blood out of Iraq okay in so you sue him into oblivion and it won't do any good suing people to make up my money it just takes money they do have if you win\nAnd I'm obviously you'd win here\nBut um but I take a long time so the settlement may be that the insurance that is the person carried maxed out and max is out of there are a lot of their assets now if that person is worth two million dollars and the insurance company has a million dollars in your maximum you're going to get out of this three million dollars take everything the person had if you wanted to do that\nAnd get the million dollars other insurance company to Megan from that person they solve everything they've got and give it to you\nOr or give it to Daniel in this case and so that that's how the calculation works but what most folks don't realize because this is so emotional and so tragic is that the math is limited by the insurance companies max pay in their policy and the assets of the person that hit them\nThose two things out of the gathers most you're going to get that because there's no magic money doesn't just appear because some tragic and this is definitely tragic\nForum situation I'm so sorry you all are facing it but that's that's how your math will shake out so when I'm going to be doing is investigating what the ... on the insurance policy is and the asset based", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "23"}
