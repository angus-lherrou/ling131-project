you're the only I guess the only school in the conference that's in an NFL city you you got a team right down the street you know it used to be one of those things and I guess at this point blank ask you is there an advantage does it help\nWhen you have guys coming year that you could say you know what we got scouts here every day and you do\nWell they do like this weekend okay like this weekend there's going to be there's going to be Thirteen NFL scouting to general managers at this moment\nTo observe this ball games so I mean there's no doubt on both sides flows ... we've got talent to ...

play against SEC caliber talent\nAnd you're going to come here is going to be developed and you could have an opportunity to go play at the next level so uh this this is a place to me where basketball football uh\nIt doesn't matter what you play okay but if you come here and you're in this market there's going to be an opportunity for you to go on and you can play a good ... good basketball and football and that\nIt's interesting but I think people understand how many times during the course of every week yeah yeah I mean you will have scouts drop by and you guys make contact and this is where your ops people at all really really get involved but\nI'm a it's more important than any specific deal any anything that we bring jobs into America\nOne of the movie that I Love that liberals

and uh\nWe got nowhere yeah what happened what was the conversation or the thing that happened that movie from age to really doing it\nI started to see the light at the end of the tunnel I felt like it was do involve versus just something that we could never accomplish\n... which that'll KPMG and so I mean you can run a half marathon or marathon and then still sprint to the finish went that last hundred yards you've still got a little gas in your tank and so seeing the finished can cause you to get intense right absolutely yes okay and that that's kind of what happened and so\nWhat is the secret to getting out of debt what do you tell people when they say you paid off all your debt when you say you pay off your desk and they say how'd you do that well\nI think we first started to start to budget together and really get both parties involved all in I was a little bit more passive early on and then I started to really look at the number one thing and then we got really focused to sell me a dollar\nWe're just ... yeah\nYou know when she went and got her second job started work on that and I was like well I Can't let her\nKnow do that on her own and so then I started working as much overtime as possible as well so okay All right and she got involved in the budgeting huh yup so I'm I'm the spender and uh it definitely if the if the nerve gets involved heavily it it definitely uh goes a lot further\nBad effects if the saver get involved in well in both of your work on it there's just accountability\nAbsolutely that was the only thing I was the thing is keeping to their accountability accountable yeah um we also um me like a vision board um and so we had like chains they really got that the kid who was involved in and take links on our teams that have\nHave them involved and they loved it okay cool cool so how did you guys get connected us my dad I found out he's a bank and you know\nSo when you kicked it into gear two years ago he was your cheerleader absolutely yep and the mom and we have we got bugs get rain we're we're on fire\nAt our church did financial peace we went there once or twice oh wow yeah so just to keep involved you know I think the other thing was we if we listen to you on TALK cast on YouTube Live enough that uh our kids learn your phone number before they learned ours [laughter]\nOkay well they can call anytime\n[laughter] that's fun I Love\nGoing to say when it had this dream was to get a dog and I am not a ... and we got a dog and we just happened to name him Ramsey\nA dog is Ramzi now he's a border collie oh All right they're pretty smart yeah [laughter]\nI was I was on\nThe other heard things around in a good job\nI could I could go with that means good\nOh my gosh you guys weren't crazy you name it ... guy yes where are you on your name around all the time\nOh man yeah you know you had to be careful what you and I have a pet we named one heaven because the one before her went to heaven and so I'm Out in the front yard yelling\nLike I've lost my mind\nOkay um and so you're doing your budget okay and are you trying to put money in every category in the budget\nThey now because we even grocery do back here that twenty five dollars and that's how we scrape that a hundred dollars or twenty five dollars a week not unlike okay right framing even on Sunday and\nDutch and so what's your household income\nUm between thirty and forty thousand dollars a year I had been an actual guard when you get to go to guard duty we make an extra thousand dollars a month bang when he's home he works for my parents Showtime and have next thirty out here\nWhat does he do for a living here mhm\nOkay so what's he want to be doing ten years or Twenty years from now that makes them a lot more money\nUm 'cause y'all are starving to death [laughter] I we I talked to him about it and he's like oh I don't really I Dreamed that would be nice to have more money [laughter] kind of acted hears\nI'm always worked really hard we got married when he was Eighteen and he worked about sixty hours a week then on the corner and held it he he is a hard worker and he'd do anything for me\nMhm okay um\nI wasn't questioning how hard he works as questioning and making money\nYou see the difference yes I work real hard to ... yeah a lot\nLike this week already sixty hours and It's Wednesday so I'm a Thursday or whatever it is I don't even forgot what it is or we go so anyway but I'm\nA I don't always do that every week but you know you've got to look at things and say for the labor and putting out on the time I have away from my family and the stress and the strain on my body in my mind and my emotions what am I getting paid in Europe the answer is not much\nIn this part of what you are facing as your income challenge\nIs that right\nOkay and I'm so why why does that brings tears\nI feel like we've just been we've had to go on\nAnd you know like I Try to be we try to be financially responsible you know we we've never ...\nYeah I don't think I don't think you're irresponsible\nThinking maybe I really I think you're doing really good because you don't have the money\nI feel like at this point I had hoped to be a little bit more had been paycheck to paycheck yeah\nYeah but it there's two parts of the equation right the income side\nAnd the outside and you know have you noticed I didn't even ask you about the I'll go out in your case and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good they're\nReally we should have babies that number you're down in about six months\nI think you're driving I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think are spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nYeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on back porch and talk and say\nWell we're going to make some more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollars you have and they're not stretch and then we've got to look at something what are we going to do to create some additional income short short term and long term\nWell actually we did last night and I actually got a job in the local library but after I pay for childcare I only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day\nOr so that's that's not that's not the answer then right after we got a better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working [noise]\nAm and he's got to have a game plan and I don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butcher in the world doing it on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be Bush's but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now\nIs it makes sense yeah\nAnd so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this because your parents were doing it or you know that's kind of exactly what happened yeah and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over eraser life on the white board of second and say\nGosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that you wanted to comment\nToday and walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way but it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed okay I think you can do it you're good people this is not a it's not a character issue and it's not a a lack of a a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing\nYou guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing or not much income yeah so and he\nUs what how do we go about ... with my parents then you know like it would really be\nWhen he's gone to drill here they always talk about how inconvenient or that and it's so hard on my dad 'cause he's a heart problem and he had to take over all of the work that they're very very small operation huh\nOkay so let's kind of think about this for\n[laughter] this is not working for your bad 'cause it's not working for has not working for you yeah so this whole thing and it working\nBut I don't know how may not the way I bring it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we are starving to death over here and we're not going to continue to do this anymore\nAnd you don't have to do it today but you know you can say you know my husband we don't we're taking classes and he's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing because that's really his dream\nYou're talking about the building you know the practice itself on sale\nI have a I have a hundred thousand have in ... and the practice it'd be five hundred so it'd be really probably have to scrape together and other four hundred thousand dollars\nIn a year I mean if you could ever get tied up for a year in close that that's\nYou know\nUh and then by the real estate the second year more than ... for the first year in ... so here's the problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you you have an obviously have a ... be gleefully fabulous income I mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy businesses\nAnd I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money in a year and I think it'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and\nEven if you um took it over ran it for a year and I had an option to buy and put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in cash for it and close on the real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes um\nI Do not borrow money mark and I do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that's how it will have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then in the third year of this discussion you can probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um I don't go into debt to buy to do business\nWith this business has too much risk with it and even dental practice is too much risk with them especially when you're completely changing the format of what you're doing in that you're picking up a whole second location and practice management comes into play then\nAnd so there's risk here there's a real risk here I'm so I'm paying cash for it or I'm not buying it and that's how I Would go about it but a good question I don't know what you'll do a you certainly got a lot of income and that that covers a lot most of the sense\nBut that's how I Would do it thanks for the call open phones at Tripoli eight to five five two to five or Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey what exactly does it mean if the\nTerm insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three should I go for longer or shorter term\nWell that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you'll have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years the premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical examined by a new policy that will not be\nGo up nearly as much as that one would go up now the question is how long do you need life insurance\nIf you've got a six year old and a twelve year old and Twenty years you'll have a twenty six year old and a thirty two year old hopefully they're\nGone that's the idea we train them to leave and come back with grandbabies that's their job okay\nThat's the process here this is how life works so kids are grown and gone Twenty years from now you would be a hundred percent that free because we never tell you to take out more than a Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nIn Twenty years from now if you were doing the baby steps that we teach you'd be putting have been putting Fifteen Percent of your household income away for Twenty years which would probably make you well in excess of a millionaire [noise]\nDepending on what your household income is\nSo let's just say you have seven hundred thousand dollars in them paid for house and no kids at home\nUh you die I think your husband could struggled through\nOr reverse it he dies you could probably struggle through seven or eight dollars no kids at home by four house point as being out of debt and building well does away with the need for life insurance you don't need it your whole life and the only home life life insurance as needed there's cause your age and needs to commission his own life and this is the day Ramsey show oh\nFew are listening rambling on radio Annie\nLazy and I'm like Mary hang around and joined us all the\nTime when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this\nIncludes
