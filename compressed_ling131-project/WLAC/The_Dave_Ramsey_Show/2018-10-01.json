I don't understand\nYou gave him a clean a hundred dollars to file bankruptcy or anything oh I don't get anything so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans to the right\nNow not right now and um that they did\nAnd women show ... where are you\nGoing to be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year and they just sit there the worst cases in which you're right\nYeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything you don't have an income and you don't have the assets they can do you own something there's valuable\nWell I yeah I own a home that living at home and I looked at the equity and now I'm at home um I have about eight hours a day and now I Can't sell the house though because if I tried to tell if I did that algae either go\nMarket yourself and then it because they're selling how are you like sixty Seventy down now let me you know I'm Ari how are you all for like one of a like a hundred and fifty thousand\nMhm why can't you sell your home a lot of them in the area that are headed again why can't you know your house\nAnd one of the doubt that I don't live in one on speaking out and about a thousand ...\nWhy can't you sell it because you have a lot of foreclosures and then people are telling them for sixty and you know what\nI'm own Ninety eight\nOkay so sell it and get out what you can out of it and pay somebody will\nSay oh my dad with that\nYeah definitely before you go bankrupt\nYou when you file bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills bankruptcy law works so the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the sale of that property and it'll be forced to be paid against your bills\nAnd I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these and you can probably settle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that you know what I mean money\nSo this is the way to get those all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this ...\nBeen so long term where are you going to be in two years were you going to be in a year where are you going to be in three years which are long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there\nThat's got to be your next step because you've got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you're the workers' comp if if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from what you're saying that which way it was but you know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future kiddo\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future and and so you start looking out there in the into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up the debt by selling it selling it taking the equity using\nThat money that thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whenever you get out of it and subtle that fifty one thousand deaths by negotiating with the gift that in writing before you send

he makes I think a hundred thousand dollars a year maybe\nOkay so she doesn't know how she didn't have to work to eat yeah okay so I mean what if she just didn't want to work\nWell uh I feel like for her type of spending that's the problem should I spend money mhm\nMhm and how old are you I'm Eighteen okay All right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder ... but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother is not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering andme our own million or on you know\nYou know it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you there's a couple of things um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend and do this and I used to do this and man when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I got on this plan to get out of debt I'm doing so good and you just tell your story\nIs your story is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right\nTo tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad who could sit down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually yes my dad has talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we don't watch his show\nMhm okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be like a husband now calling now that's a little different standing and he puts his arm around his wife and says look we got a problem here you're spending like you're in Congress I mean we got to stop this there's a problem here\nAnd when you sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life\nAnd we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save so that we have to live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you wrote because you're he's got standing he's got a position in the household to have a discussion\nWhere as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying your mom's eyes you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing and um you know he can sit down and if it wasn't my house on insurance I Would just sit down when I have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem and we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long\nTime and it's time for him to deal with it now that that's what I'm saying hey thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five

City very cool yeah I Know your wife like sandbags early booming\nYeah she's got a pretty good collection [laughter] she deserves anything she gets that is right up with me so\nWell done you guys you wonder how long you been married seven years in All right so a year in a marriage you start within three years later you kick it into high gear for sure how many there are about the journey what happened in and show other people how it's done\nOn right after we graduated we had so much in school that\nAnd we just we need to get rid of this and and\nI grew up in a single family home than my mom worked really really hard and so I wanted to say I want to take every advantage that we had and get our you know get everything in line and be successful or not you know\nAnd I felt entitled like I deserved a jeep wrangler and I work too hard and so we really were fighting and I just felt in title I was acting like a little boy and I needed to be coming man and I just well I she deserves better and I just I had to you know ... my pride down\nTo what happened what what was the breaking point what kicked it into gear because obviously you flipped an obvious and shoot the way she looked at you just then when you said that was a ... and it was it was really the way every man wants his wife to look at them know what you just did was incredible so tell me about that one huh\nWell mainly just argued a lot and we wanted to have a very healthy and happy marriage and I just remember standing in the kitchen three years ago and he held my face in his hands and he was like we are going to get rid of the S. and I think um\nWe just finally got on the same page and felt like we were connecting mhm um because you mentioned a lot that when your priorities are nine in your budget your priorities are aligned in your marriage and so for us that was kind of just something that was really important Mm\nYeah and I just I didn't have any hope I didn't think we could do it I think what what\nFlipped ... which I got this we're going to do this what happened\nUm I just I\nI think I just didn't want to hurt her anymore Mm hurting I Love her so much and I don't want to it just wasn't fair to her and I was the one who's spending money and going out to eat doing whatever I Want to do and so\nAnd I was hearing your not important yeah finally we're like we're the most important thing in on us and we need to get our finances in line and be on the same age in our our life moving forward\nAnd so at that point it's game on yeah and what what kind of income where are you making at that point three years ago I think between eighty than about eighty okay so you're still come up from ... to one twenty five during that three years yeah very impressive very cool so then what okay you've made the decision were on the same page then what happened to make\nA budget and it kind of\nIt was I felt constricted at first and then I kept listening to your show and it's like almost like give me permission to spend money saved to spend money it wasn't like oh this is going to cost me a night on the couch it just felt like okay we're on the same page and I felt to an acting more when I found is happy and I was like you know stuff doesn't make me happy anymore and I don't need\nA jeep wrangler I Need new clothes and they don't need to go out to eat like I'm just happy this is more important than anything else\nThat's a nice benefit definitely thanks thanks for the call Anders next in Canada hey Andrew how are you\nAll are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] gay so we have just recently paid off our house and yeah so we are completely debt free and just wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay\n[noise] okay so we\nLive in a two bedroom townhouse pretty tight we have a family of four and one on the way ...\nSo we\nAre a ... here for a little while but in the next few years we don't want to say about than pay cash for a larger ... good\n... so\nMy income is roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife know that she is on maternity leave really making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't eat no okay so you have a hundred thousand dollar household income what your townhouse worth two hundred and forty to fifty and when you move up what what price would you move up to\nRoughly four hundred\nOkay she and a hundred and sixty thousand it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollars how long has it gone tricky to save a hundred and something thousand dollars\nFor our question is I I Am quoting a wave the Fifteen Percent a month long ...\nOn my employer nachos four percent ... so we we have the Nineteen percent ... that's going Nineteen percent of my income that's going to retire on them ... my question is would it make sense to go back to St baby step three D. no and you know know\nWhat a what is your age uh I'm thirty and my wife is going on in okay\nYou got plenty of time you're going to be OK I'm into here here's what's gonna happen during the next three years five years whatever it is your income going to go up and the value of your town house they're going to go up or slow value what you're trying to buy is going to go up to right but it's so we're not dealing with a fixed\nItem to do forecasting with the fixed item your your income is not fixed it you know you're going to see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there\nBut um no I I Would stay at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that comes your way inheritance is bonuses anything else the role that in the house fun don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it in the house fun though in the house fun though", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018",
