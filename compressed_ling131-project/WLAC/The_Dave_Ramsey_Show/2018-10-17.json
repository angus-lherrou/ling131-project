day Ramsey show Scott [noise] they said to myself how can I help [noise]\nUm well I work as a truck driver and I'm never home so I'm On a buying the house later in life like retirement and I'm Wondering what would be a good idea on how to invest that extra money I have to put my house in Middle East now you know that's a\nGood good question how old are you a fifty four fifty for near single\nHanukkah and how many years do you think before you buy a house [noise] um I'm thinking oh at least sixteen okay\nAll right cool well as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple growth stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would just using this in the index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should fall for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my that all of you know about basically all my debts except my car or any collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating\nUm bankruptcy why are they all go actions\nUm they're like oh medical bills um one is a is a car that guy I'm ... I lost my job and I think I think like a phone bill is America mhm\nOkay so how much is the ...\n[noise] I'm actually only like a couple of grand ... it gets what I have on there is a nine to five thousand four hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment mhm how long ago was three and a half years ago\nOkay and how ... how much how much by the medical data again\nI Would say about two thousand\nAnd one of the dead of you've got\nThe rest of it is it makes it very well like my ... a ... I think a phone bill and all with payday Lowe is well you know\nSo you're you're totally that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm\nOkay and what do you make a year\nI'm a little bit for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married older\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday\nThe happy birthday does she work outside the home\nI'm no she stays at home and takes care of her daughter\nOkay yeah mhm [noise] well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that that is not the problem is is a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment so your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved him on and made all this debt go away which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that and made you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change the habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are some day do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get under that says bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think are bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and I've done nothing so far\nI think you can probably shuttle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I've\nI've actually called them a multiple times where I started listening to you that was like one of the first videos that I was looking up and try to get that collect bears you know from under you\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand or three thousand new film I bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control your money\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a debt problems such behavior problems got\nIs a total money may go read that take an extra job sell everything in sight and let's get this mess planes I'm I'll show you how to\nThis day rams you\nTalk radio ... three D. W. ...\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nThat functions like a membership club think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee\nAnd you say big every time you use it\nOn talking discounts on all procedures from routine cleaning to root canals in fact two of my team members of saved over a thousand dollars with the one dental plan\nAnd this is not just for you and your family there are group rates for your business church or association available fulltime part time and contract employees volunteers and members joined the Fifteen million people across the country you are already saving with these plans to get a special discount for my listeners go to one dental\nDot com slash days star saving today at one dental dot com slash Dave\n... says talk radio Ninety eight point three and five genes can W well ac [noise]\nOh thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nWell first of all I Know a thing about you know three weeks ago and I was driving in a hurry you're on the radio but my first baby ... with my mother or nine foot my readers I Need money to go to work\n[laughter] [noise] but I have five between me and my wife we have five four one K. is our age and I was\nWondering if ... you might consider consolidating those cars I've left former employees employers actually she and we were all their stuff over and I so I Would just want to watch\nEvery different four O. one K. will be a different IRA when you roll it\nBut you could have five I our age that we're all rollovers from previous\nFor a one case or previous IRAs and they could all be at one investment broker and one person won't watching over it with you\nUm and that's a viable uh so uh yeah I I Would get was one of those smart Mr burrows I was just talking about right before I picked up a call ... ... dot com and they can show you how to do those rollovers or shouldn't be any taxes involved if he'd roll over a\nTraditional i._r._a. to a tradition our traditional four O. one K. to a traditional i._r._a. there's no taxes on that if you do a direct transfer roll over\nAnd I'm Don we're always recommend and I personally invest with recommendations that I use oddly enough\nA too that we put your in retirement and my retirement in four types of growth stocks mutual\nFunds gross growth in income aggressive growth and international and are spread the total of the nest egg across those four and a evenly twenty five percentage Kathy is with us in Wisconsin I Cathy how're you\nI'm good how are you there aren't any better than I deserve what's up\nUh my husband and I are looking to retire within the next two to three years um them hadn't been for sure now we have a third of our income or environmental parents have been\nWhere a financial advice you currently and I'm Wondering like your opinion is and having more than my financial advisor\nWhy would you need more than ... [noise]\nI'm the only reason that I I I worry a little bit in that you'd have all of your your retirement savings windy and\nIt's not with them they're just advising you know you're on where to put it you're not with them I'm not really they're they're the I mean it's like saying I'm\nYou know I've got four different cars and so I'm worried about the mechanic already own cars and the mechanic is just helping me manage all before cars\n\nIt doesn't change the mix there'd be a two of the cars one mechanic and do the guards were the other McKenna you've still got the same for cars and you still have to manage all four of them\nSo it makes sense yeah I Do I don't I don't know that now I hear your\nBook I well I it's not connecting them because it's perfect but uh it added up to the ... the idea is this the investments that you have are not owned and operated by your financial adviser\nYou owned them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you own\nAnd so you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds\nAnd a half two of them was one advisor and two of them more than other advisor or you could have all four of them was one advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds the exact same for by the way\nBecause you're you should be making the decision about where your money goes the advisor teaches you and advisors you but you should be making the money the decision about where your money go you're not blindly turning over a block of money and go just doing it whenever you want\nYou know no that's just dangerous as crowded you need to know everything about where the money's going and understand everything about it\nAnd so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit\nAnd an information source and if you don't trust the information to shore so they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to you need one at their information aligns with your value system and what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk you through that\nI have one and there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case and and so but the twenty five counts are mine they're not here\nAnd he just advisors me on whether I Want to put more and more I'm more than one open another one whether I Want them to them together we just talk through what these funds are doing with these investments\nGoing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that then I make the decision of what's going to happen when my money and that's what I Want you doing and if you do it that way then there's no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors and the only reason you would do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that is what the analogy was trying to get to where I guess I missed it sorry about that Sean is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nA ... a very good how can I oh ... oh I'm open\nTo give you some numbers here real quick I'm fifty five dollars in cash about forty modern raw her\nDidn't list a debt it can still be bankrupted did they not put anything down for this long at all it\nDid it on I mean credit as a student loan and we were under the impression drier attorney that it you know wouldn't matter whether we put it down or not I mean we start getting hurt every you know that\nDoesn't matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survives the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit is what it is and it completely was bankrupted\nOkay so did you put down chase student loans some amount on your matrix yeah I'm not worried about it it was a banker right it was my corrupted address your bankruptcy was discharged yeah OK\nThan if someone comes up you go and says we yours the student loan you say no that was bankrupted a there's a study originally chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody could find you people but you know it's clear it should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupt that I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae loan\nPossibly I mean like I said my husband's not very organized by I mean we could say it was a private loan I Know that\nI don't know a ... a a private student loan is basically an secured long it's just the one that was used for college okay you just use like a personal I'm ready for college is the same thing a government insured Sallie Mae alone is not bankrupt double a whole line of credit is bankrupt we usually the difference\nYeah I mean we have plenty of there we have plenty of Sally chair to pass\nYes Sally Sally survive ... she's a resume how broad and so as you just can't get rid of our until you pair off in Victor\nBut the other stuff that is what you're saying I wouldn't worry about that right now I don't think it's going to come up if it does come up you don't have to go back and um there's this later I I filed bankruptcy Thirty years ago and there are two years later American Express came at me again\nOn a similar situation that was listed on the thing but it wasn't they didn't get notified because of the way it was listed they don't have to be notified\nUs federal law and for the courts and bankruptcy court federal bankruptcy court and so I sent them bankruptcy papers and told him you know just remove the account don't report on the account anymore you're not allowed to report on it because they count my longer does this mean they can't keep reporting it as bad dead after a bankruptcy on your credit bureau report\nBankruptcy just on the line in the sand is drawn the chapter seven clears it now the chapter seven will stay on your credit report for ten years but the everything that caused it stops on that date and that's the way you look at it so\nGood question thank you for calling in I'm sure you guys are facing that but it sounds like you're coming out the other side open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in and we'll talk about your life and your money they've got a question about going into storm mode\nMy coworker was recently promoted and now he's my boss\nWe've never seen completely odd about things we'd been known to get into arguments professionally of course but now that he's my boss I'm afraid I'm going to always end up where he says I'm right you're wrong I just feel like he's going to get me fired my wife and I are in baby steps to uh what do you advise to do\nIf you feel like the probability a is greater than fifty percent that you're about to lose your job for whatever reason than I Would stop all of your baby steps I Would stop your total money make over and pile of cash\nAnd um\nMeanwhile I'd look for a job I don't know why you work\nIn a cesspool environment like that on a horrible situation there were a person that you really don't like and never agree with this now your\nBoss you didn't say leader you said\nFalse I'd get out of there that's what I was so while you're getting now they're not once you get out of there and get settled her when she gets fired and your gets settled before the storm money out just throw it out\nWhatever maybe step your own probably two

rabies Tuesday may the best one was oh\nWell that day the best football team playing that they do there yet I don't think that those guys would agree with that it was a bad day it was\nBut um so you you've done that travels several times you do some other NFL worked as well so some of the other teams have called and you and ... both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm ... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up a I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next week it what do I do\n... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelm money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents\nKnow how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car\nAlmost any names but there are some um rookies out there that have had the opportunity to to mentor\nAnd they're you know they they they're going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget and with the coolest thing was with the ravens I can say this was all of them sign up for every dollar\nA couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar play and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see\nThat a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they

telling a leadership team this week that I was talking to a group of pressures we were with yesterday that ... you can't attribute\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one

worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key yeah but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps there's like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical or a cue the things you can do with this body in mid error or it's just circus like
