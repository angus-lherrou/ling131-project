didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMet a share is is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nSo worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you eight five five\n... people that look for two hundred and Ninety and three hundred thousand dollar houses don't drive down your street\nRight okay\nSo when you price when you have a house is worth two Seventy five and you spend Fifteen more on it that's two Ninety and that's so you're likely not going to get your money out so whatever you're spending there is in a sense consumption it's like saying I Want to go on a really nice vacation which is okay you have the money\nAnd I probably would do some of that work I probably enjoy some of that money by spending it on the house [noise] but the likelihood is\nIf you told me your house was worth two thirty and or the average house prices to fifty five and you spent ten or Fifteen on it and then you would be like up to average\nAnd you would likely get your money out depending on what you've spent the money on what the repairs were or the re models were I probably would do some of the work just for the fun of it you know just to enjoy the money\nBut uh but we can't do it based on the fact you're going to get it's going to increase the value of your home 'cause it's not likely to what the numbers you gave me Eric is on the line in Salt Lake City Utah Hi Eric welcome to the Dave\nRamsey show ... trauma what's up\nA got a question just started listening to your podcast or my dad listens to you and he's been recommended for a while but uh we start listening to you and go through financial piece of my wife and are planning to do that Tom just finally got her on board with everything\nI'm my question is to start a budget have I'm a contractor and so I get paid you know performance or or peace rates so my my paid\nChanges all the ... one month we might make a thousand women who make four thousand sure how the ... budget without Dave take\nConceptually here's how you do it in the mechanically will walk us through in a couple of different ways okay conceptually we just say okay what's our worst month and the next coming twelve likely it sounds like yours is five K. very like it's very very likely you're not going to be below five K. in the coming twelve agreed\nOkay it might be very unusual now so we set the budget up regular on five K. we ... we have five K. coming in we're going to give every one of those dollars a name on assignment of mission and show five K. minus my categories equals zero every dollar has an assignment\nOkay on the five K. and so there you're going to take care of most of the things in your life then the things that you couldn't get on that list but you still primarily in this case is gonna be want to do not need to do or it might be want to save some money it might be want to go on a trip it might be want to pay off some debt it's you know but it's not nice\nSorry for your living you can live on the five probably it's kind of gravy bonus money so to speak above five K. we make a list of those\nThings and we say art after our regular budget if we make a dollar what is the most important thing on this new list that didn't make the cut on the budget the understand\nYes sir okay and I don't care what it is you and your wife look at that and you say that's number one\nOkay you say are we ... we made enough above five thousand to do that when you put a dollar amount decided it's four hundred and Ninety dollars okay so now we made five thousand four hundred dollars when we make the next dollar what's the next most important thing the ... this month that don't have to be for the rest of your life is just put this coming month\nAnd you put two beside that and then a three and then a four and then you rewrite the list in order now you have a prioritized spending plan for each dollar that comes in it already is spent by prioritization above five caves that logical to you\nYes or no that's your concept the practical application is one or two things you can use your every dollar budget apt to do all of that and just change it through the month as the money comes and just go okay\nWe're we're going to set it up on five but as we get more money animal changed the income and will drop down in and will change the list okay and you can apply it right through your every dollar budget out or\nIf you've gotten your financial piece university materials or you've got the total money make over book or any of the any of the books that are have my based on the front I'm just about they have a budget forms in the back in the back is an irregular income planning sheet\nThe teachers you to do what I just talked to the day but you can do is yellow path\nI mean what I just described is basically mature Saturday morning to do list Mamadu Mamadu honey do list right momma said get it done list and what's the most important thing on hairs on my car smile that's number one\nAnd then what's most important thing in after that's number two we get those two things we had a pretty good Saturday but we'd like to go on the number three and so on rhyming it's just your prioritize them to do with your money\nThis is the day Ramsey\nHannity on Fox News on radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ...\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's\nPretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance since it's the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ... dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two these are the guys I\nPersonally use the term life insurance is inexpensive and your family\nNeeds this no matter where you are in your baby steps that\n... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty

Ramsey to get the best deal Hanna is in Georgia says my husband and I are on baby step three be\nNow what that means is that they are dead free except their home they saved up their emergency fund a three to six months of expenses and three beam means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on their house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World you should we're\nCurrently saving to build our on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you\nSuggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm\nJust gonna take me a little time 'cause I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do their hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job\nGenerally up and they don't charge not worth that much\nYeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're saying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo you're right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so I'm what I'm going to do is look for\nA place I mean you got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours and the co pilot seat and get some option landings and get some of that council actually\n... those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently I'm Robin ...\nSymbol type aircraft gotcha\nNot even a turbine yet but um I mean I even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those ... or ... and our short jail out a lot of those guys are buried busy\nSo I can get it our air and our there but not being very conscious as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours does occur eighty hours cost\nWell considering some of the hour and a waste of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know so\nShe won a thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue to in the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah\nYeah definitely so passionate\nYeah why not I I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a I\nI collect handguns and shoot them a lot\nAnd uh and and also I burn through some MOH but it's a power don't make any money doing um I'm trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies cost wrong in this one was not going to cost you money to actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just gonna put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks none of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season I\nWant to pay for it in return you promised to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that you know without much intensity\nUh sometimes or an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area also helps destruction [noise]\nList Ramsey show\n\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that

team that's pretty cool\nLaura's with us in Houston, Texas Hi Laura welcome to the ...\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nHey I'm I have a question for you in this day and age are you going to have your theory of the industry twenty five years old I'm ...\nI went off or ... I got like ... the I think there are a lot and I have come back after I left that they you know apple pie and all that I have to go I think that for it that you know four\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars mhm [noise] and at the ... I Can't say that we have had and now I get all the time I only get you for thirty thousand dollar pay that cash I catch the whole thing um but I'm just wondering if it's\nSomething it's just better to buy it rather than start out because I Know that's a start up but it's like they don't want to get your opinion on it\n[noise] well um what I have found is the number one cause of small business ... is cash flow and cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail that don't take care of their tax bill and they get bombed on their taxes and they go into debt number two\nAnd so um you you increase your probability of failure ten ... if you go into debt and do this and\nI have to tell you I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years are doing the show advised anyone to go into debt to buy a business and over and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill whether all those clients leave the next month or not\nAnd that could bankrupt you\nCan ... fairly easily actually does you basically don't have any money\nAnd so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is they are valued you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um a persistence rate and I mean the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating ... a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance industry might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nA supposedly for what I have a guy can how can\nYou would make three hundred and ten thousand dollars in the first year\nApparently a profit\nI don't have access to the book yeah profit\nAfter after the rent is paid the secretary is paid every body I paint\nAt their payroll after ... after ... after insurance and\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\nA\nWar that we can check it came out here\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three ten\nYou live on nothing you pay it all back when I got three\nOh okay well then it takes three years yeah All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like about four times the net profit because that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there are about four factor that's a fairly normal appraisal Rachel they're not ripping you off on the price has a but I Would not go into to do it I Would start you're on\nTalk and then when you go make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own by buying out another practice you could save up to money and do that is if you are making two ten in through every three years you could save up and buy a business is worth six hundred right\nRight and so for me that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are buying out other stand alone but I I Can't recommend that I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years older plus veggie burgers or I personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here and it's a two hundred million dollar business in seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a card table my living room and all the bumps and bruises alone when I'm really glad I didn't have any debt Vicky is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are you\nHigh bay and it's like if they clicking view to what's up\n[noise] okay I Am trying to save my hands of law with getting his credit report prepared and claimed that he is currently deployed in the military and Kuwait\nAnd um he had found a bad bet on and a collection agency has taken that we're dealing with one and we offer they sat on the line I sat on that amount with the head of my later\nThey responded and Marie ... offer and they sent me back a form letter that just had one time traveling the author only the ... shadow which you for that amount we had asked for some more stimulation like\nCan you can have some kind of face you're not going to fail there for ... party\n... also says settled in fall into the owner of the day you're fine\nThey were geared to pay it out of it for a little wary of counting based these guys are kinda that they are not terrible\nTheir third bottom feeders that's who you're dealing with are probably ... ... what kind of debt is it ...\nIt was a medical bat and about three about three or four years old\nThey paid a nickel two or three cents on the dollar for it and their debt buyers and they are but there are bottom\nIt appears between six months a year from the time that you have all zero balances and no open accounts if you have a credit card and you're paying it off every month that's an open\nAccount right or that you can have no debt and still have a credit score all the time okay so if anybody is reporting on you and the only way that would happen is if you have an ongoing\nRelationship with them in and you're still owed them money or you're still using their products even though you're paying it off every month a ... card then you will always maintain a credit score some kind so the only way as if you have apps that you go off the grid basically you're saying I have a zero accounts opened and zero balances\nOf any kind of bad debt no good debt no no doubt that I pay off every month no debt of any kind\nRoughly six months to a year later we're finding people's credit score disappears disappears now when I first started this I still had a bankruptcy showing on mine\nAnd so it was not going to go away for a while because I had this bankruptcy showing in a chapter seven bankruptcy will report on you for ten years and show up on your credit bureau report and some of the whole creditors that you bankrupt on that you don't pay they might report after the bankruptcy they're not supposed to\nBut sometimes they're computers kick out that they still haven't gotten paid well they're not going to get paid just ... percent of the guys we're out and I had two of them are three of them reports three years later\nAnd that started the whole process over I had to go back and disputed those because they were not allowed to report that um they did ultimately get paid 'cause I went back and paid my bankruptcy but um as a moral thing not as a legal thing but anyway all that to say\nYou've got to have the thing completely squeaky clean and then apparently if they haven't changed at this month and they don't start counting your rent or they didn't start counting something else that\nWe don't know that they count then your credit score will go to zero which is what we call it but they technically call it in the terminal because they have no way to determine a credit score\nUm you know they actually sent me an email back in the day that said um you know we\nWant to check on you because our credit score a your credit scores disappeared during ... on the terminal and um we wanted to make sure there was not a mistake or that you weren't dead um and I kind of thought that was a threat but [laughter]\n\nSo subtle passive aggressive like on a southerner says bless your heart you know I mean it's the same thing right [laughter] so yeah but yeah I bet zero for gosh twenty five twenty six twenty something years something like that either interminable credit score\nAnd uh I've had an interminable amount of money as a result because I don't have any payments\nAnd it's a pretty amazing thing open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five amounts in Charlotte North Carolina Hi Matt how are you\nA good day appreciate tech my column we'll get into my question sure\nUm I have a side business and I'm strongly considering taking full time going kind of get your thoughts on it everybody and it's kind of thing is always scared to do it and I am to ... um it's a handyman slash home service home repair business\nWonderful business\nWell so far as trade to make good how long

Would love to know a guy I'll get Jim awesome and it's all about but I can get you in law will get you a pair of tickets so you're here to do your debt free scream I Am a lot about how much of you paid off thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars some bright love it\nAnd how long did this take it took three years almost to the days since I started the financial ... very good and your friend your income during that time above forty seven thousand two fifty thousand good what do you do 'em by day I'm tech support at travel and expense software\nAnd by nights and weekends I work in the film industry mostly doing onset audio but other things to find good for you very cool what kind of that was the thirty two thousand it was mostly student loans but then also a a car loan and the car repaired\nAlone to Josh in okay so you a single guy making forty seven thousand payoff thirty two thousand and three years which is um you know basically a thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and that's the that's really watching what you're doing you must have casual and the whole thing\nYes it was it was a very tight ... when I was at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if if I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic bills in food and gas I had about forty dollars leftover per month while do it was it was tied\nUp some extra jobs and that helped but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't pay too much [laughter] okay good deal good deal so three years ago you said you started financial ... journey began\nOther than that I'm kind of a story well first of all my sister who's here um I did uh did your program and deter debt free scream and that's how I first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by us most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it um which wasn't smart or\nUm so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved sixty miles away from home just by myself doing apartment\nA sign a lease everything figured out everything was good and I had to move on the seventh of August and the third of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done wow and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get to my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I had been\nSmart and only buying a cash in cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery it breaks down in a year I'm tired of like ... and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm gonna get that one [laughter] pay too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so\nBut of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account ... and so moved up there and about four months later my that car the engine fry broke down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened\nAnd so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like I'm not going to let go this car I just got it for months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replaces the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if it was for a moving gift or if it was for um\nFor a Christmas gift corny gave me a uh the box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I I'll probably do that I'll probably get around to jump out your sleep in the same room with the box it'll be just going to actually learn it you know by us most is [noise]\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis to do or debt free scream and I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that\nA good sister rules are exactly so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor so\nI finally got it so it was her fault [laughter] rightful all minimum wage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you to be here to there you're dead\nFree sharing Zach Zach I'll take it doesn't work such good family stuff right there and I should say it ends up being a pretty good book into\nBecause I went out of 'em got out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on this big trip to Montana\nAnd I am I the same vehicle that I got replaced um you know the engine replaced\nHow old are you are I'm twenty seven now how long you been married five years you all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this check yes absolutely what he's trying to lose\n... we uh they just need to pray about it and we figure out what what's the most wise decision as\nTo how much on track for [noise] twenty seven five will not pay off everything\nI'm not quite but we do have a five hundred and savings or we could take a I think maybe three of that and be done with everything\nEverything but the house ... okay yeah good and then begin your emergency fund sure who passed away\nMy grandfather\nOkay All right well there's a couple of gauges we want to do number one we want to be biblical was which is what she was saying and pray about this and then number two we want to do something with his money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and so you're doing this and smile\nOddly enough that these are actually the exact same things um because when you start going smart things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right\nThere and so paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in\nAnd that's what bothers you a little

membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks you've seen some of them some of them have been redrawn since you saw them and you go through those\nThen when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and worked the baby steps but uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors and have something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to\nStraighten up then you could really cause a problem lighter um and show what you want to do is proved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your
