{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Our next move here and the next few years I'm forty nine and she's forty six\nWe don't have kids um and we're thinking about moving to the Las Vegas area over the next\nTwo to three years we probably are playing for an ... um my question to you is we're looking in because we do a lot of travelling um ourselves and so we're not sure ... looking at her condo\nOr and actually having a home would be a good idea what's your what's your opinion on condo um 'cause we are planning on whatever we purchase we're planning on having fun but we eat you know have no market\nAnd that's good okay my opinion on them regarding what value increases are what\nWell uh you know so the thing the thing because we we buy a condo um we're looking for three hundred thousand\nUm mostly do with our colleague thousand or something like that um if they don't waste of money I'm used to go into account of versus a home we're just not sure what the right financial direction would be\nWell no it's not a waste of money um the benefits are as you said you don't have to deal with the exterior maintenance it when you're traveling you've got neighbors that are close and if something curves obviously you could\nYou know or have the next door neighbor or the person near you have a key and that kind of a thing there's a lot of possible good things about owning a condo\nAs far as they as far as a condominium increasing in value\nA everything that controls the value increasing on real estate there there's three things location location location right right and and so is it or is it a condominium in a good area\nMeaning to an area that's a stable growing that values are increasing a good neighborhood to neighborhood people considerably a desirable place to live\nA ... and so I Want to I Want to buy a condominium in a fairly a ... area or in an area that is you know right on the edge of a rapidly growing edge of an established area that kind of a thing from a from a ... British resell standpoint okay\nAnd um you know if you do that you're going to get similar growth in value to what you would in a single family in that same neighborhood\nSame families to do a little bit better there is a little bit more market for them and there is condos but you know uh if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'll be fine and Vegas would be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the ... I wouldn't want to investigate because you are a planner the budget\nAnd um how they're doing with the ... way budgeting let me give me an example I had a condo come I own a rental or a many years ago when a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the exterior maintenance which would include the roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roofs are going bad\nRight and they don't know planning to get rid of it so guess what they did a special assessed every body and the place in addition to the right way fees to keep 'cause they had to have Ruth ... Lincoln all over the place exactly but that devalued the condo in both took cash out of everybody's pockets\nOkay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for exterior maintenance no reserves for roof replacement in their budget\nAnd you know when you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into and so that is the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that H away reserves budget\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of ... on a bunch of real estate I hate H always\nRight generally speaking the people that want to be on in charge of the ... way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney Fife\nWould drive you freaking nuts absolutely and there are people that need a life\nNow there's exceptions to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nBut yeah I'm currently currently live in a home or the ... right now and I'm the president of yet so [laughter]\nBasically [laughter]\nI said at our you know\nI I stay that way because I didn't want to run into a firefight kind of situation very guy\n[laughter] right well God you say yeah there there's\nA lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness I hopefully you're now on you know that at all [laughter] but that's what you want to watch for is the politics\nOf the association I'm In one eye joy the barrel suing each other and it's just on the whole neighborhood just melting down you know just ridiculous so you just hit it you got it\nThat's what you could get into you if you're the president says she already knew all the stuff I was just talking about them as far as I'm even\nReserves in a\nSituation things there that you've got to have reserved\nReserved covered [noise] so\nThat's all you got to look for [laughter] that's fabulous lists Ramsey show [noise]\nHey guys this is James

that I Want you to do an exercise where you spend a little bit of alone time today while it's fresh in your mind I Want you to write out several skills that you have because you have more skills than just being able to talk well\nAre you you you you started a business and sold you started a fourteen and sold it I think you're thinking way too hard and I want you just release your brain right out

you to sit down with somebody who knows you very very well and there's also a truth telling your life and we want them to be able to verify and confirm both of those list\nThe reason is is that 'cause

what we would\nCall her retirement fund and then about six thousand a checking account\nAnd that retirement fund has been a rental house that my brother used to pay all around the house and he's basically been given or all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that become a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not his focus so it go it often goes without a tenant\nMumbling steady money coming in\nThe oven and wondering you know have you have a recommendation on and maybe a better um consider an investment maybe a dip it in pain dog or just a mutual fund or want to get your thoughts on that her\nAnd her financial um situation is hard net monthly is about two fifty and the whole once you get to the Social Security I'm after she pay their rent which includes an independent living with male so that three hundred two to three hundred a month and we've been chipping away at or checking account\nOver the past few years now by its pound only six thousand ... that's about to start hitting the fix the\nOkay the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah her about the past eight years okay now you've got that trash and that's invested in want in my brother's one of my brothers rental property how would you oughta mom's money it's not in ...\nCould liquidate and he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he ...\nThey just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving her all the rental income\nOh I see okay and so her investment that she has made and this rental property is not doing well because there's not being managed well\nCorrect okay um and where is the property\nIt then it around Jackson, Tennessee so she lives in Memphis with me and you know it's near my brother is in his home town but you know there's still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think the ban in thought\nIt'd be better off I'll sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent\nRight and that covers or shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in paying five she think that\nMore than our labor no I don't think it's more secure safer because you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks in the grip and I wouldn't get into that um I Would like that or I'd take a growth in income mutual fund\nAnd a balanced mutual fund put about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and just during the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation in to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month in\nAssuming you're sixty out of the sale of the house but yeah sit down with a good mutual fund advisor to you work with one\nOf my company uses fidelity so they've been\nPutting you know you don't work I was a financial advisor then your company is\nYou're talking about your fry one K. and stuff okay All right yeah not just grab one of the smart Mr pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom Saddam to even if she's are just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income\nThan have to generate a lot you know a couple of hundred bucks shorter months\nMhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed\n... don't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in ... but the\nLast year I think that any kind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um are checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drained are checking account\nOkay I Gotcha yeah than let's cash it out and put it in a good mutual fund or a couple of good mutual funds and let's walk through\nA child would do it some good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five our question that comes from blondes dot com you do not need a second mortgage to make your home over get brand new custom window blinds without paying custom prices from blinds dot com\nBank that would be willing to give up money for a non traditional loan cars were first time homebuyers on an unfinished house and I did find a bank that was willing to um as long as they finish get within five years and ah but it would appraised at two eighty um recently\nSo are they foster kids are adopted kids in their adopted now they were played his daughter and completion ... yeah what could you sell the house for right now as it is\nI'm Glad we could probably get to fix the for it\nAnd you and you are what on it [noise] one Seventy as pretty tempting you know go rent something in clean this mess up\nMy my only concern with that is because trust me I have many and thinking about that is our kids we had we have five kids total we have two biological and tree adopted\nOur three adopt a kid all have to clear the rack of attachment just some very serious mental stuff that they're working in fighting through\nAnd I just I'm afraid that move and a shift up in their life again is is going to\nI'm afraid parents being stressed out and never home because they're working all the time to clean up a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars where the stupid that's going to cause these kids' problems\nAnd that's kinda where where yeah I work a lot yeah I'll bet\nAnd you don't have a life\nAs this crap on Jew something's going to give you need to decide what's going to give or it's going to give without you deciding\nIt's going to blow up on your dude\nYeah so you didn't make the call I think you need to sell your house\nAnd I think the kids will deal with that temporary shift and change ... easier than they will deal with two years up to three years of high stress in the household\nAnd you never being there yeah\nI'm no I'm no kid expert Rogers race three but ... and I never dealt with the stuff you're dealing with and I understand they're very sensitive and\nI get all of that on a I'm not trying to be on the ceiling I'm just trying to say I'm a rip the band died off guy and I think even with the kids with that situation that might be the case I think you guys don't want to sell the house because part of killing the dream of the rehab but the house too emotionally\nAnd so I'm going to blame that on you and your wife I I'm gone man I I'm just ... you're\nYou're working on a house you're trying to run a business you've got kids with the issues that you've adopted you got a house full of different things coming at you at one time you need to get a few things off your plate\nI mean if you lived in a house that you didn't have to work on and you didn't have any that\nWe got rid of two of your three huge stressors here and I think your quality of life will go way up\nSounds really appealing to me it by the way it's stupid house there's houses on every corner\nYou get you know the house [laughter] but you guys have painted yourself in the corner you're gonna get pain on your shoe ...\nThey just decide which one you know and so\nThat's one thing you could do that then you lose you sell her car or you saw a bunch of your equipment that you've got and start the process of cleaning this out but who am I not going to pay is not a formula that takes you good places in five years when you've got some other options so I I'm\nI I Love your heart I Love what you're trying to do for those kids that are messed up and you're loving on them and trying to help them turn their life around and in the middle of that that you you're just you're good people man\nYou're my kind of folk I like yeah I Wish I could just wave a wand and make this go away but if I knew I'm going to concentrate on these kids and the quality of life my family can him over the next five years and if I don't have this debt\nAnd I don't have um the stress of working all the time to get rid of the day that all of the sudden I've got my quality of life back\nAnd if the one thing I did give up was this house mess\nUm oh and by the way I don't have to work on the house what they what hours I Am home I actually spend time with these children that are swinging a hammer when I'm at home um I just think there's you you just put you put your Superman Cape a brother you're trying to Seventy three things at once I don't think you can do it all\nAnd I think that's showing up in your numbers\nBut um I think you're good man I think you ... do the right thing and you're trying to love your family oil but I'm if I'm you I'm selling that houses just a stupid house you can get you know you get out of debt you get your business built up you bring up a big pile of cash you can buy you another house and two or three years\nAnd and you know settling there and you're is that the dream of homeownership is not off the table the dream of doing a rehab all I have three kids with P. T. S. D. in my house\nThese things just don't mix\nYou know it doesn't mixers too much going on this thing I feel stressed out just talking to you about all of it and I don't have to deal with it so I see what you're facing I'm so sorry but that's what I Would do and that's what the shows about what I Would do so I can do whatever you want to your grownups but um I I\n... who you're not gonna pay is not the answer who you're not you are going to pay mom and dad because you're going to do that out of guilt and your company the Irish or they don't come take stuff um\nYou put the student loans on hardship for all you can decide not to pay the credit cards but eventually you got to get this mess cleaned up and it's going to come back to roost Anya so I'm Glad you're in financial position ... and if I can help you further you coming back anytime Lewis was in Palm Springs California Hi Louis how are you\nMarried it better than I deserve what's up\nI'm trying to advise my mom she she uh she just clean it up the hill and she is out of debt except for her mortgage\nUm shoot cat Nineteen thousand dollars cash in the bank um class another six thousand she\nCould be getting shown from a an investment she's trying to a\nCash out of that she potentially will have about twenty five thousand dollars cash I looking at her budget I figure about twelve thousand wouldn't be a good three to six month emergency fine okay she's got about a potentially Thirteen thousand dollars extra cash machine\nWell actually long term goal I Do want to own my own business um this switch to get me back working and to have an income um we we were already planning you know long term things and we knew that getting out of that was our way to get\nTo where we want it to be Joe yeah I I Want to make more money okay well right now it it it facilitates me working and working on our future plans\nOkay All right I'm ... and so this this move down in house you're moving more than half of house\nUh it sounds like a ultimately but even if you rent for six months or something in our moved back in this price range or you know it wouldn't if you're worried wouldn't make any sense um and so this move down to half of the house is probably three to five year plan correct\nOkay All right because you're going to do something to get your income back up\nA without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nAgreement 'cause that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in fear so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like\nThat this is a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling on and make it your life\nThan I'm cool with that that's kind of where I'm saying so hope that helps a good question and a courageous decision on your part to do that James is with us in Rochester, Minnesota how James how are you\nI'm pretty good thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm\nAh [noise] well I I got married last fear got your book is the president ever heard of it before that and then uh I'm On board my wife has left so she's kind of just going along with it but I mean she's not 'cause they'll and I'm willing to be\nHow old are you I'm thirty and she's twenty two so she's kind of going through I don't know a front page she makes twice as much as I Do a year and uh it's hard for me to say no we can't go out for dinner or you know we can go to the mall for a day um because she makes so much more than I Do [noise]\nI'm Sorry I lost your ability to vote in the household based on the economics\nIt [noise]\nPretty lame no I still have a vote at I\nI like it just is not as well as hot as my ... she just got to you got one\nIt kind of that that's how I feel that's probably not how she feels that off\nOkay I'm In ... because that's not a good way to have a relationship but you should not make decisions together based on who makes the most money has the most which that's not a good plan especially when one of you starting in the other one's twenty two\nOkay so you got a little more life experience could we agree on that\nThat's right okay good and that's not to say she's in up to twenty two but in this case uh apparently she is so uh in in this particular subject so how are we going to this year's started talking about what we need to do we don't need to go to the mall\nWe don't need to spend so much money we need to get a day you start talking about what after you read my book instead of talking to her about how and why\nYou sit down together and dream and say well what if we were out that\nWhen we have no doubt at all\nWhat what what if we had a million dollars what would we do what can we would we travel would we give more generous lead to causes what what do we do if we had a million dollars well what's the shortest path to get to that dream\nOf being able to do those things the shortest path is to live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else the shortest path is to be dead free and living on a plan and adults devise and plan and follow it children do what feels good\nIt's a sign of maturity to learn to build a pleasure emotional\nMaturity whether you're twenty two or fifty two\nIt's a sign of emotional maturity and so this is how you need to lead in your household\nDuty to serve your wife\nYou

I have I have a son already but in any case I remarried Monday option to have more children and how old are you thirty nine okay All right um\n\n[noise] there's two there's two things that are bumping through my head and they're ... they're they're both are working against each other okay so I'll just say I'm Out loud or the ... it was just process this together a little bit okay thing one is I tell folks not to use their emergency fund except for emergencies\nGuy thing too is this is very very very important to you obviously it is and I I mean it's it's\n... and you have a a window of time you know a show I guess what I'm going to do is I'm going to shop around and and make sure I've gotten all the possible ways to pull this off is twenty grand the best most efficient most reasonable most safe\nWay is there a Fifteen grand methodology is they're thirty five grand methodology is or other things that I 'cause I don't know anything about this at all um I mean other than the obvious to you know the higher level understanding of it but I'm\nBut I'm going to ... to gather more information anytime I'm buying anything for joining around I'm going to learn a lot and you may have already done all that but I'm going to I'm going to really push it on the research always the more options you have met when making a decision the better decision you always make you follow me during that time I'm also going to just be piling up cash like crazy\nLike my hair was on fire let's just keep adding an adding an addict but the other thing that comes into my mind is forty thousand might be an adequate emergency fund for you\nAnd that's the ... this is not an emergency we can say that for sure but I\nFeel like I feel like it it\nFeels like the only I didn't know how it is but it's not an emergency it's not a a it's an unexpected event it's an elective\nLuxury\nThat's very very very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes I might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay because the catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way they would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "26"}
