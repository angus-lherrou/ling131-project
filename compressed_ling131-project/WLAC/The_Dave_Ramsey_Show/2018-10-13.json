D move up kind of a thing that I'd be okay with that if you want to do that but um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise] Josh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n\n[noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card from business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off offered to them about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically ... you know pay for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to see pays for that but we have to kind of want that money had the time um [noise] we pulled out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have much to the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars covering the hotel\nMood and then you're you're going to get the money back then you get the money back within thirty ...\nTo ensure household income\nOne thirty year that's good\nOkay near Fort paid for rentals and they have this one okay yeah um how quickly can you pay this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI rarely meaning to it [laughter]\nAny here every three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could yeah\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television and sit down at the kitchen table tonight looked at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people\nAnd pour it all on to this rental for two years is this rental worth that to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or going to pay no horn and we want to sell it\nBut I don't want to but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rentals if the best way to do do it is to live debt free than actually live debt free\nYeah stop it yeah\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah\nSo um you know decide because I think you were really doing good until we got to Home Depot and borrow money for rental and then you kinda like lost your mind for a minute\nOr\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot it's moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we loved that rental that much\nI you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get by to ready to buy a rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with this rental but I Would do one of the others\nThat's what I Would do so Hi thanks for calling in sounds like you guys got a lot going on I mean you're making good money you get your school stuff you can do here that's very cool thank you for joining us\nJoshua is with us in Chattanooga Hi Joshua how are you\nHey Dave

I mean the one point five included the pay off with a mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing by the force Seventy and what a reduced yeah the other ...\nThe cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we're about a hundred and twenty left the map okay\nAnd that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off shore okay sure so the ... a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this right was done with this label at least two properties oh yeah oh yeah wow\nYeah on All right at all of the aisle of the extra staff which there's a challenge to an advisory or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to go to the lake and how and mark caught me on board I\nThink what made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one the four Seventy one in ... worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go so radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity as all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was you know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple\nAnd he wasn't that way on one of those\nAds [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you ... or ... from the beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the ... what's your word\nIt was really difficult to to get something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that ... but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nTheir work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive\nAnd negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel about him and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and\nSo I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever\nIt doesn't feel right I don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes spirit weaker than I deal with the negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern actresses different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I go through the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not Murphy you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent trees you say sharman freeze exercises I don't belong in a particular\nReligion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways when personal ... wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a distance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused\nEach one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it and it it's it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world\nIt builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt\nWith you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it's it's difficult maybe a professional to have it cleared out one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields or and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply\nQueen her own carpet once that's done so it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nThat are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits are also\nThis universe is filled with stars\nAnd around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances but the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which called me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more

written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said he's had to tell his his small team that there really is just no place for political bickering network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays for salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens is we can determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for\nCorporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then go from there\nHow much of this uh boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on on all sides of this that they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that are just I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played on at work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal reporter ship cutter is twelve minutes now after the hour

upstate New York last weekend just seeing the headline breaks your heart but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr Judas or law\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly unpack and what they do if their heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own body and a lot of their past traumas are trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nA accidents and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they\nGo to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and the center yourself and realize that you are not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's finance and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons and the brain for I'm I'm past too that's why it's such a an interest in it on the ... and an impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle your mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\nMm So how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you\nKnow it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how do you begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pass patients has to take news fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught\nYou know I I was trying to find something in return they didn't have a single newspaper um they have all kinds of candy and snacks and cookies and um drinks you can buy 'em your budget can buy lottery tickets they can buy lots of different kinds of cigarettes\nA week and by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets and NYPD I'm snow Globes you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws govern what can be sold are there any laws that say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands um [noise]\nWere first coming up ... and these are just the sidewalk new standards that are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands 'em a fan's veterans city property you could only sell news and\nUm it was even that it was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties the said he agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies that a great them to let themselves like pre packaged food and items that cost less than five dollars and now the console just about anything\nKind of food and beverage wise as long as it's packaged in any kind of like Nick ... is a lot of it's under ten dollars they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because I think they want to keep them in his hands from competing with for front retailers for good reason um\nAnd then the city does have a law that if you're a newsstand you have to sell no and they actually said he told me they send out people to force that last but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or a lot a lot of space too I'm selling the newspapers because the Americans are super low and they don't sound very much I'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and and so that things that have a lot you know a much higher margins\nAre sticking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stories I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the new stance or selling\nIt you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back alive a long time before like you know ... came and so I think even though\nUsually the the retailers all his fight it tooth and nail and then in the stands come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia in the city and a lot of action so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going um another reason is that the\nNewsstands officer to um [noise] service kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um rents out the sides and backs of the status for for um\nSelling advertising for the city wants to make sure that the newsstands can keep going it has an interest in making sure that\nThey all start folding they want to keep us alive to keep that ad revenue coming in\nThis weekend's
