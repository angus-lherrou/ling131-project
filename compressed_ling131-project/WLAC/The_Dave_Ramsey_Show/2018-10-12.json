{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "It's on a car and you know this is the more miles you put on the car the more you destroy its value correct correct\nAnd so if I'm going to travel um or for instance people who travel for a living people road warriors I call them they you know there there have to travel for work all the time I'm In that case you want to drive in that case you want to drive the least expensive vehicle to get the job done because you're destroying whatever you drive\nI mean you might want to drive a hundred thousand dollar car you it's going to be worth nothing by the time you've finished traveling\nAnd so I'm unless you've just got millions of dollars and you can afford to lose a hundred grand but but you know most people don't have that so basically what we're saying is is you're going to take the Seventeen thousand our vehicle and you're going to cause it to drop in value faster\nThan anything else what's your household income\nUm I make about eighty thousand until you're single ... single bachelor renting renting a small little okay All right I'm always hanging out you have any debt or just the car that ... ... um eleven thousand okay All right\nWell there's nothing you know I'm hearing here this crazy as long as you realize that you know the Seventeen thousand dollar car might be worth um you're going to lose a few thousand dollars extra on it just because you're going to travel in it okay\nAnd as long as you're willing to do that and what the kind of money you make you should be okay let's get the car paid off as soon as possible so your preferences keep it in drive it is that right\nOh my privilege to keep it from five or six years yeah but my friends and and co worker whatever the fate traded and betrayed it you're crazy to keep it to trade it in for what um last night on I I was sitting around the brand new BMW forty uh-huh exiled falling in love with\nRon well that'd be easy to fall in love with that but the but that's even more expensive so we're going to destroy even more expensive car if you want to travel and that right\nYeah and to upgrade to a brand new one you know that would be twenty percent less\nWell number one they're in day out and you don't have the money to do that so that's ludicrous we wouldn't do it on that basis alone but on the idea that you're going to travel in it no you don't want to you know you don't want to upgrade and destroying more expensive cars about how you\nShow if you if you're gonna travel you need to run the wheels off for something that's not going to cost you as much\nSo we don't upgrade in order to lose more money when we don't have any money that that doesn't make sense at all so whoever your friends are I mean they're they're encouraging you lose stupidity but I've had friends that have encouraged me to do stupid or even I didn't have to do it though uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than than there Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay Dave so far I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased they ridiculous\nCar [laughter] and as soon as I found you I was like crap [laughter] off what'd you buy\nUm we bought a ... with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat yeah\nWell not fulfilling because my pocket hurts\nYeah well I guess but I mean the cars great\nNow okay oh yeah so what what do you owe on the ... thing we'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your house and I'm\nHere will be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my over time oh yeah there's five just hanging on you know\nSo and I'm next year I'll be getting into a Fifteen Percent right plus another five percent right down the road yeah I'm so here's my ... I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with is a memo I finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah\nShe ... down into it or\nDie that bad yeah and I that that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that that's not enough as a spread on private sail\nFive thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it 'cause we had any extending warranty yeah and and we found out back and it's funny how when you pay off vehicle or he reached ... miles all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and nor chief counsel to you or did it the cars one of our old\nHe and I almost a year old yeah\nAll right so yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nFinance or me and my wife is looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could save up that money and I already have in my neck thank um refund\nBut what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for the throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars so because I also have a student loan and assuming payments like one sixty eight but almost done with that and we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what it what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm filed a difference and goats and the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars\nAnd just make payments off on this for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess\nMhm yeah I mean we okay with them yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing the is your second car the ... of the uh the five thousand dollar car that you're buying how are you financing it\nThey'll just go ahead just like you know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half right\nAnd um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting that car paid off and then getting the whole that you've dug with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing just drop that foreign value\nUm make real sure you got your numbers right on that because I I mean I [noise] the cars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a car guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that is incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check that and make sure your number your numbers are a little high\nOn terms of lost money I think you maybe you haven't lost as much I'm hoping you have ... you think you've lost so let's dig into that a little bit further and you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to so it probably say it should be in this situation about a five thousand dollar difference\nIn other words you should be able get five or more out of the show and it probably sell than you would for a dealer on something that expensive\nUm so I really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but wow what a dead gum kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing and good luck with it but yes I Would get out of it\nFor sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing good in the story thanks for the call

today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments had Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable\nYou would be a renter was an option to purchase the house for the loan balance for a number of years until you get your other debts paid off now much all the data you got\nThat fifty four thousand left on figure oh\nOkay\nOkay so she moves out you move in and when you sell your house oh how much where you're much equity we got out of your house\nMaybe Fifteen without and not very much at all\nOkay so excel or at the baby the baby up to a little bit he ... the payments not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what the interest rate is on the loan\nUm lets her she writes refinanced about two years ago said I Would imagine that it's not very high\nIt's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to assume you could get a mortgage that was a very similar rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on in baby step three but it's going to take you a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year or more to live there\nRight [noise]\nWell I don't know if I Would do it or just because of emotions but this is not a bad thing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario\nYou're a renter you've sold your house you're renting it your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it and so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you have to move because if you say no now she needs to just sell the house right\nCorrect yeah thank God so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract we obligated as we're going to go into Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment and we won a written contract that we're renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere\nUm there is a brother\nYou know everybody's going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this equity given to you\nKnow you sure as far as I understand that now\nThere yeah I think we're all having copy in one big pollen talking about this this is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so yeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want\nYou to lease it with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance okay\nLease it for the payment was an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just to sell it then and that's no different than her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nYeah it doesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is eight hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this is a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe\nI'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay personal finances personal\nAnd that doesn't mean that situation only ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go hey

just ask them down and I was spending like crazy and I didn't know that I was the majority of the problem in our relationship and then when you said um if you have a problem with money it's not the money you\nKnow I'm just kind of lifted blinders off my eyes and I realized OK I'm the problem and\nThen I had to do something to to get all that ... ... ...

I Know I mean I won't go a little bit Neal trash I'll be happy\nTo close on this deal when my trailer cells yeah\nMy trailer is so my trailer hasn't so I Can't close until that happens and so you guys need to dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to the next guy and that's probably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver you'll get you another house and don't get desperate\n'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate as soon as you feel forced\nThat's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you should be close on\nIt should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it on because you're just not going to close\nTo see if you do you're going to regret it you're gonna end up on both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem\nIt's going to damage or financial is just going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell them just we're going tap the brakes boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get disclosed and we'll close if we can't then we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well\nI'm I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday and then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling and um I Would walk to exactly what I'd do calm down\nMark is with us in Indianapolis Hi Mark\nAnd you based on the job that I Want is their land we figure out a babysitter\nI'm it sounds like you're following mom around a little bit I don't mean that in a negative way I mean it's yeah it's just a baby sitter thing is drawing un and it feels like that's the wrong way to make this decision I'm not sure it's a bad decision\nBut I I yeah I think it might be arrived in the wrong way and and so it wouldn't help your next time so I'm you know I was asking myself okay you know ten years from now when these kids are our early teens\nWhat I'm you know what what what\nWhere do we want to live what do I want to be doing for a living at that time and ... kind of moving our life in a long term trajectory a long term mentality trajectory rather than just oh God we got to have a place to we've got a babysitter\n[noise] well I grew up down there and my brother lives there and their family and my cousin or my wife doesn't have any family here so okay well you're living with mother in law right yeah well she's the only family she has here in the state her family live in Cuba\nOkay All right well I mean it ... if you know I Want to be near family and I think I can my career can prosper there as much as here or more uh maybe because I Know more people are and you know have more credibility to sell pest control or to do whatever you're going to do what city are you talking about moving to\nA it would be North Port which is court Charlotte area or just below Sarasota\nOK okay bicycle a suburb of Sarasota yeah yeah pretty much\nAll right well that's a good strong economic market and um yeah um\nYou know in terms of your your long term\nUh prospects 'cause if you can sell you could do a whole lot of things and make a whole lot of money\nOver time maybe or maybe even a different form of sales at some point in your life I'm thinking out there ten years you know where where do you want to be doing ten years from now where do you wanna live ten years from now and does this take us there I don't see a reason not to do it if you want to do it I just don't want you to let let's say that something happened to\nHer ability to keep the kids later and you go home and we moved down here for that now you moved down here for other good reasons and she happened to be there to keep the kids um that's the kind of the way I Want to view it because it's more of a permanent decision then we're not just\nUm you know bouncing around because you don't want bounced around that that'll cost you a lot of money\nAnd law emotional pain Victoria's with us in Hattiesburg, Mississippi Hi Victoria how're you\nDoing\nBetter than I

and fitness coach\nOkay very good and what kind of debt was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off\nNo we just pay them off in the car got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started so\nProbably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right um other when you're going out and we decided to baton for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we won and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we didn't brand new\nAnd it was in we are just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we won ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in the process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like they'd we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ... celebration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start at a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on her second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's the ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of things from what drove me to it because I Believe in modeling all the eight years and now if I was going to model what I wanted my children have in the future I had to model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught and taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out\nI mean oh my goodness you know it's ... much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did not do it\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know one of\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend\nToo much [laughter] well that's true but generally true\nOkay so I I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that my reason why it might not be the exact same reason as his way but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ...\n[noise] I I thought about and ah I'm ... I'm already starting now planning on um I'm trying to get jobs or at least one or two jobs over the summer I worked for ... hours really teaching them the gear to get off this with credit cards\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor or what subject do you teach\nI teach theology specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would have not\nNo my athletes it can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have disabilities cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting off the couch and exercising or being physically active now more toward the competitive fun\nYeah okay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where you worked hand\nA hand in glove with some there are people in the therapy community a would be ideal for an ongoing extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer a in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research in your expertise\nAnd your information that ought to be very valuable uh and that you could build a coke business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you Dave how are you doing today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles Korea so thanks for that\nBut [laughter] I I drive into base but whatever I\nLive in the car payments because I told my buddy as you also there struck me told me about sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like we need to talk anyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a truck and I got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home\nUm and my uncle is willing to you or your labor for me for free\nOr to get it fixed up putting new engine it when you train Ian and all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck a problem I see is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable it's probably not going to be reliable as a moderate are what the law which would you consider going down the road and you know dumping a couple of allergy and to this truck to make it you know\nWhat you know driving around or do you you know save up and wait for a year later on\nI think the trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that previous was gonna say I hate it too I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up\nSixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty bad debts rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... do four but dual ... for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "12"}
