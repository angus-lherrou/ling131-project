there to believe that he knows how to eight degrees he knows how to get hands on he knows how to get off lots he understands blocking schemes and he knows how to slip okay get underneath and or run

says the fake news a lot of it has been fake news it's not even news\nOf his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton threw him through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit and it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it\nFor example but we've vetted Obama when no one else would we ... the deep state more

are\nInstigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never it never has said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words are so ah inflamed is not because of him

passed\nAway two years ago a mom I moved in with us [noise] so um she couldn't make it on her own that we just kind of command our income um\nOur monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars I've done the everyday dollar budget and\nWe're like forty seven dollars and not over budget as things stand now um we had back in January we had an identity theft going down in our account and that it is\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou feel like you were rich like you were multimillionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation where the over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation was on my own sell them something\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to work forty hours a\nWeek necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem that you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income\nAnd legitimately ... you're struggling it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nMan it would change everything for you a thank you for the call open phones interpolate eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nAt Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eye on what are we paid it off about ... ...\nIn your eyes or your parents or any kind of financial perspective is a good time and I think at night and kids because she wife's getting kind of cushy and that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one on a kids' faster than Sharon ... she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids or if you're broke that stupid okay that is crazy but where are you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids in God's says is okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people they need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to beat a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the early in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not that\nIt's not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of 'em away if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife and you guys are in good shape financially smart you're already moving in the right direction\nYou want to start now doesn't bother me at all [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W ...\nDid you know that if you

down with them and we put together a plan\nThat I felt provided the best protection but didn't waste dollars on things you could easily do yourself or we're just gimmicks the key is getting protected before you were a victim and it's too late go to Sandra dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two we're all at risk\nAnd it doesn't make sense to wait numbers don't lie that's

that you just don't want to use this doctor better than what you said in the email\nSometimes I hear people say you know I I'm not going to tie that church because I don't agree with things that are going on at that church\n\nBut you're going to trust them to spiritually train you you're going to trust them with your children's show one Sunday school class you're going to trust them to influence you on your view of scripture scripture and your walk with ... but you don't trust them with your money\nWell let's just dumb so into the system that's appalling\nYou don't trust them enough to touch you don't trust them with money but you trust them with your salt that's just weird\nIt's just a bad idea so that's the thing\nNow I have at times with the church that I'm attending while I'm watching the misbehavior of leadership and I've taken a little time off of tithing and set it aside little bit to see how this was going to turn out but long term if I'm not willing to give their I shouldn't go there\nAnd the same would be true of this doctor story here and is with us in Baltimore, Maryland Hi Ann how are you\nI'm great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I paid off thirty five well not paid off but I paid thirty five thousand dollars in less than a year good for you huh toward thank you taught student loans listening to you and then I was in a car crash and the money thing going for medical expenses and\nUm I two things I've lost my motivation and also and the other thing is I found a great deal I have come out of body um problems with my car and I found someone who is willing to do do it for cheaper price and I want to get that we've had that\nBut it's going to be eight hundred dollars\nAnd you don't have eight hundred dollars\nWell I have this I

called Dave Ramsey and said I Want to use a credit card on the air\nOkay well I take that back [laughter]\nI mean either way you are going on here no I mean you've gotta you've gotta think about now Dave Ramsey things but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motivation is you're inconsistent\nYou need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts and you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to wells and generosity and stability in your finances sustainability is to get out of debt and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what I Need to have happen now you had a car accident did you not get an insurance settlement for that\nNow they're saying that there was no no ... or damage to our vehicle and they're saying they don't believe that it um in that crash injured me but I I'm actually had pain before the crash occurred\nSo I'm I'm just paying for myself with my health insurance\nOkay but I'm Talking about the car wreck did so you did not get any insurance for the damage to your car\nOh yes I did I got five hundred dollar that

decent money but got a big pile of debt and I don't feel like a written oil\nWell I I'm a travel junkie and so whenever I realized I couldn't go on all the trip that I Want it and yeah\nBroke yeah kind of you know was horrible about being on a trip and not being able to afford things to eat\nNo area and so what happened twenty two months ago\nI was traveling with my boyfriend to time soon to be my husband ... and ah he the year before had paid for a trip from both of us to go to Costa Rica which was great yeah um so I was going to pay it back and say hey you know I'm going to pay for our trip next year ...\nUm and then realized I can actually afford is um airfare whoa I had to go to come and say hey can you can you purchase your own airfare um so it was kind of that you know and then also thing and made good money and\nI couldn't do everything I wanted to do stomach\nToo much money to be this broke exactly so what'd you do\nUm I got really serious actually read the total money make over um about six years ago mhm end started to to become ill intent started to understand some of the teachings\nBut then um the twenty two months ago is really whenever kicked in going\nIn this stupid why am I taking so long to get on to that 'cause I'd started and then stop in and got back into it mhm so that's whenever I you know I had my lovely excel spreadsheet I also use every dollar out um so we started doing all that and plus my company started to um do smart dollar at all it for a company or a Becker\nOkay great so they taught smart dollar yet which is going through the whole clash as an HR benefited your company yes very neat and so that gave you about the time you were disgusted in ... an airline ticket while law smart dollar appears from the ...\nYeah and actually um to circumvent and I and I think when we go through this process you start to get really creative mhm so one of my passions is to travel so I became a national speaker and had other people pay for my travel I was just working the entire time um but I still got to do a lot of my travel while also working on my income and\nAround the country are small\nYeah that's not bad at all on a professional eater I Wonder if I could get them pardon me for that\nYou'd be surprised what people will pay for a little they\nWere when you get creative it's exactly right so the company teachers from our daughter you're going through it you get your income up with all these side gig you're traveling getting paid you know software on the side you're doing your work Ninety Ninety thousand dollar job and what is the secret to pay off forty eight thousand dollars for the dead and twenty too much\nSo I'm I'm a marketer um my one Tibet is don't pay attention to commercials or social media boat because that's the second you start to see the restaurants on commercials or the cool stuff that people are purchasing and showing off on social media you start to have that why should have with the Joneses have mhm\nSo don't put as much weight into what you see that all the marketers in the world that are really good at what we do if it's trying to get you to purchase something outside of your means ... shut off that that device to shut off the TV set off the apps shut off the social media um and do something else for your\nTime absolutely the other retro cruise book love your life and author that what it's all about his don't don't compare your life to other people's highlight reel on Facebook yeah yeah very cool good for you and what did you do did you cut your spending did you sell stuff did you live on beans and rice what'd you do\nUm I so I sold some things I did a garage sale and really I Want it to get rid of the clutter in my house\nAnd um I actually created a marketing campaign around my garage sale so I titled that I'm ... turns minimalist mhm and I did a full fledged marketing campaign around it and also create a posters to go in my yard and I had a poster of you with your face on it that said they Randy is making me so much stuff [laughter]\nSo um that's funny and they want to comment on that or there was\nThen yeah you need to show something the second thing is can you be dead free everything but your house in a year I'm Sorry and two years within two years if you can ...\nTake an extra jobs up so much that the kids think their next beans and rice rice and beans don't see the inside of a restaurant unless you're working there are no vacations busted and be debt free scorched earth and be debt free\n\nIn less than two years then you would keep your car even if you owe more on it then it's actually works 'cause you're gonna pay it off and you're going to clear it you're going to own it it's going to be all through all done\nRight that's where we're going to end up now\nIf you owe more on your car then it's actually worth and you can't it's going to be more than half your on your own income\nAnd or you can't pay it off inside of two years then you do need a salad how do you sell a car that you're upside down on that you owe more on your car then his work in that case if you need to sell it you've got to cover the difference\nYou owe twenty thousand dollars on the car the car is worth sixteen you can sell it for sixteen but you've got to have the other four to put with the sixteen to get the title from the bank\nIn order when you give the title to the ... in order to give the title to the new\nOwner\nAnd so where are you going to get that other four thousand dollars if you're upside down by four thousand dollars well you would have to in that case\n\nBorrow the four thousand dollars saved the four thousand dollars or talk the current lent Linder on the car and letting you sign a note for the four thousand dollar difference\nThat will only happen if you had like a credit union or a local bank won't happen with a big bank our car loan company General Motors credit is not going to do that\nLexus motor credit is not going to do that and so on so that's what you do hope that helps open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money John is with us in Detroit hey John how
