Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it certainly made a difference in my life\nWell thank you signed up today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading cause hell for about two years now and that we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans were working on and then we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her first\nChild in April so hey we checked your advice and\nStop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank and all that good and a ... month we we now have enough for her to take her for a month maternity leave um pain free for us which is great and that but the problem that the Murphy has decided to strike a\nLast week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a with a baby on the way here and another two months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so\nMy question is what would you do it in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do\nWhen somebody do\nA better than the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that we usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe\nBecomes pile up the cash when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your debt\nCorrect as long as baby mama come home and everybody's cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and\nWe're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much cash if you've got piled up or will you have piled up by the hour what\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she was knowing that she's wanting to take the three months off the phone with a baby on such and we can't do it on my income alone so um that's why we're smart about this and it said that\nGold and make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much I'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have from other than our car payment I Try and do you have you have actual that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not on your car and I'm not sure all your car alleys\nAnd often dollars okay well then the four thousand would be your\nYour pay it all up

hurt your credit at all your credit is not involved\nIt's her credit that we're worried about we want to do a nice thing for her 'cause she's sick and not able to deal with this so uh what she

in a pinch us is very uncomfortable because there's what needs to happen she needs to sell this car because her niece can't pay the payments and when she sells the car she's going to lose seven thousand dollars on it what are we going to do with that\nDo you feel obligated to pay that\nYou're not legally are way I don't think I mean you know what I Do get because I Know yeah I like it or not

thirty five hundred and let's get the car so if she's too sick to handle the transaction have her signed a power of attorney over to you for the this title\nAnd then you get the car sold and um I have her come up with three thousand five hundred and you go borrow three thousand five hundred and that's your penalty for being engaged in this on her penalty for being engaged in this because the other option as you stop paying the payments and she gets ...\nDoesn't sound really scared of the credit yeah that does that doesn't sound like a good plan to make because she's going to end the sick\nOld

you\nRight Dave thanks for taking my call and I've been here for a while\nI I have a problem that I'm hoping you can help me with my daughter who is bipolar just had a baby two weeks ago and she was living with a man\nWho had family had died and he had three small boys to make it short she knew a lot of things one is taken out a couple of title alone in her car a road\nFor check as credit card debt so to make a long story short she's got quite a few collection agencies after her\nShe can't be clear with me right now about how much she really knows I don't know I Believe I think it's over forty thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of dead last year\nShe ah [noise] it's almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay her death\nUm what does she said in these collection agencies I mean literally she has nothing\nIs ... is she still living with this guy you know he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nHis kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight these here in Arizona I gave myself and my husband uh the responsibility of taking care of the baby now we can go wherever she wants that baby stays with\nMe okay so has she now moved in with you yeah she's living with me the ... the baby on the mother correct\nOkay good good that's good news okay good so here here's the thing that I'm ... ... what you told the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing\nAnd she's dealing with bipolar and you know you they she is what we in the business called judgment proof Oh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants and that's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking that she wasn't you know her boyfriend has said to me well I didn't make lead find anything that she wasn't aware of it but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that and the second book let's assume that debt is valid for\nUs it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her to work our way through it when she gets back on her feet will\nShe might even got a job right now I Know I Know\nYeah I Know what I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally is working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid in us in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we work with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes majors\nWith off from it for the past year and I realized she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me I shouldn't get pregnant armies mad because she's on today for men's every day so she's been off it from the bottom\nLine is ringing I'm line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions about everything child rearing financially\nAnd everything in a bi ever had you know but it can happen and can I address on what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself you know of of her checking account because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nIf I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over I Can't give them any law enforcement agencies any information bought if that person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend\nThat's what the heck happened and you'd be surprised how ... how much information you get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo no no or or if they do they're not passing them on exactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show marry him in a while to get to know you are a little bit better you've had this gift since you were a little girl correct a well were you\nGrandma realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth tone spirits the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was grandma special\nGranddaughter that could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person would just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket but\nHe was he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person because I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did or did you always have um like\n[noise] no I think that the older I got\nThe easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is\nAnd then in ... even though I've done this\nFor so long I still learn stuff all the time and by ... so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough\nFor somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or\nAn airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd but she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that oh you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is happening\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually\nLipton uh red handled act in front of my face\nAnd and I will houses if I thought I go to kill me I Am certainly not stupid\nBut I remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor in Libya into a fiberglass garage door you had no idea how loud that was when it hit\nAnd it was a three step into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me not at all because of all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal line I got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light is still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man does it look ... Gurley not so much anymore now when I tell them to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older and then all of\nThem now have you ever have you ever come across the ... the double\nOkay so if if you're an average voter you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence are you saying there are there are some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nOr there has always been the possibility for our elections this needs to be hacked 'cause at four glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I walked motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper about the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nMean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nShow 'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have a ... need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\n[noise] oh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nUh in that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad while you're um that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington did she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got the more we have today\nOr how about like in the coming years you get the sense that we won't have as many issues as we have now\nI think the problem is is that we have we have had this um ah up for a bill a bill has come in Congress since um let's say four or five times a since this all happened in in the south and\nTrying to mandate paperback up an audit insistent and lawmakers do not pick it up as an absolutely no interest in this been primarily because it's

America's first knew this weekend with Gordon the\nFirst full weekend in October glad\nYou could share it with a serious subject to your wire sexual assault victims not always willing to come forward the reasons are many years this weekend's Jennifer ...\nHeated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlights on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons\nElizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] for the numbers have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount it's even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics of what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex are so many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to tell people go over the details again a and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we're in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so are there is a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position um [noise] uh not often but sometimes there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong\nThe ... you know you drop it in a pot or\nYou know or you you know by the seashore and certainly a big wave comes in ...\nIt's that kind of thing you're not meant to swim with it do it in a shed technically you can keep the phone and leash standard ... you can keep the phone and fresh water for up to about two meters for half hour or so I guess you could swim in it under those circumstances\nAre the phones I'm more durable than they've been or is this the standard and we've been carrying\nAround on well we've heard it before but apple says yes indeed that um you know this is the most durable clash they've ever put on an iPhone I did not do drop trash I Know a couple of people who did and some people are reported no problems there were a couple of ... marks couple of people I talk to\nAgain apple claims it's
