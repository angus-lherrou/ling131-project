{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "A couple of years okay it's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess then yeah let's Raj from checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them\nYeah good let's do that today and then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses\nAnd uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund except your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps for five and six do you have children\nBut right now okay\nThen ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make\nBut it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring and during the British stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order um [noise]\nOnce you're doing that then maybe step father's kids' college that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house or at Emory job or knock the house out beyond that which is has the same effect\nTo your net worth that the bridge loan does because I have in your home paid off frees you up in ... to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which\nReally do how much do you own your home\n[noise] all of a two eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty your house is going to bite off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your one hundred percent that free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nAnd I have a single parent in the world mathematically with one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing or bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to to do some stuff with before that but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth as a result\nOf having no payments\nTo go with your fabulous income uh your most powerful wealth building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invest in there for one k.'s and once that's maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for the income producing or something like that where you've got some other moneys that you've got access to\nThat is not return not all caught up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back of a line as to the front of the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there fast her view of the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about you clean up this mess you make too much money be sitting around stupid car payment it's ridiculous man thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five\nBecause you know you can again you can do this for a year you could lose for two or three years but you cannot do it over the scope of ten to Twenty years and\nProsper\nBecause your your house poor at that point your your your house was draining the blood out of your life and you you just don't have anything left here you have no margin you are no\nWiggle room and uh so you guys have got to sit down and analyzes or something we can do to get our incomes up substantially or we've got to look at living further out\nIn in a different setting where it's not as expensive I Know California real estate is expensive I understand I'm In ... in and out of California in and out of Manhattan all the time I understand these markets I Know the markets but I mean it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan unless you're making a hundred dollars a year\nUm you just cannot afford the rent even all of a studio apartment and so that's what you're facing in your market there are ... and then the ... you know we're talking about this in San Fran the other day when I was over there you you cannot afford to live in Silicon valley\nUnless you make substantial money and so I mean so this and Silicon Valley as a result is having a real problem staffing service type jobs\nBecause nobody the service type jobs for typical service type income can afford to live there and so you run into all kinds of people are being busted him to do\nLabor type jobs and a ... you know because we can't afford to live in Silicon valley and and that's that's just a mathematical facts of the situation so that applies to you and you've got to make some decisions are is are we going to do something with our careers that allow us to live in this house or\nAre we going to do our in order to stay in that job and and the general area we're probably looking at a more substantial commute Amy is with us in Detroit Michigan Hi Amy how are you\nHow are you David thanks for taking my call sure

with you the smart conference in Kansas City last weekend phenomenal you did a great job presenting that really connect it didn't it\nThank you yes it uh it it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about the practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean we can all his vision a mountain top\nBut then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountain top and as we talked a lot about the proximity principal and gave people some ideas on the right people are going to be around and and the right places that need to be because if you want to do something to be in the proximity of that thing\nIt has the proximity principle simply says in order to do what I Want to do you fill in the ... like\nThat I've got to be around people who are doing that and in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they help point means to the right places and then when I go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn or I can do and where I can connect\nAnd date when I'm In the right places I inevitably going to be more of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to getting where I Want to go you're an example and here's what's great about this no matter how successful you get your always practicing the proximity principle you're continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires you want to learn things about these men and women\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be an awards Ramsey solutions need to be\nThis is a very simple principle that no matter where you're at in life if you want to get somewhere you have to practice proximity you know I've noticed that happening here\nIn our little bird outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a melting pot for people who write\n... in the self improvement space centrist hand who uh who speak and the self improvement space\nI mean I've been here all along a Mike Hi it a ... has been in the ... a friend of mine down the road Donald Miller moved here in the last couple of years in from Oregon ... from the ... moved here about the time that book take took off there's probably a handful of others that I'm not even thinking you're mentioning right now\nUm but a lot of movement and it just seems to be this thing happening and it's like an almost like an artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community now\nAnd you get around things and the people\nAnd the places to certain things happening and then you have a better chance of pulling it off that's right and it's not that the Donald Miller or director Mike Hi it in Iraq there are already in every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we've all interacting and we've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy\nBut it is a very much all within about five miles of each other you know as an example\nYeah ... it's here's what happens when you get around like minded people\nThen there is a natural\nA force if you will it's almost magnetic\nThat they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you you know there ... there was a guy that you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him\nCharles tremendous Jones

fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight\nIt might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person\nFor me

interested in\nSo you're moving from one of those ... those are\n[noise] spent much of a move\n[noise] no it's not but it does have a lot more upgrade than what our house has now because if we stayed with a we would have to invest money in the house to do the upgrade or um or we could move in the quake have already been accomplished\nMhm or you could stay up to the courage or we can stay in the way not do the courage or we can stand not to upgrade I don't really have any and save money and move with a ... right there's no way\nI Would go back into I mean you've got out in the first thing to do is go get a house fever\nRight and that's after hearing that ... that that dream that you had on I thought I but I Know they are already\nYou know I mean you knew what you want to do I I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible it's a tiny little mortgages you\nSaid but I just I just couldn't go back once\nThis hard to get out I mean you you have a two hundred and twenty thousand dollar aid for home in Roanoke, Virginia let us\nNot to buy a house that's where I worried house as a matter of fact\nI'm well above average square footage and the United states in a great neighborhood by definition in the market that's what the house so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you to do what I what Sharon and I would do\nWhat we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us back in there is nothing on one bad enough to go back a little bit\nAnd there's a lot of stuff I'd like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish the only the money to do but I'm not quite dead for it even for a minute even for just a second because my life is so good\nWithout any pay much so you do what you want to do but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just make me throw up think about it um I Can't there's no way\nSo what what I Do I say either you know piecemeal out of your income you don't have any payments you save up some money picks up the Algerian as you said there's some upgrades or if you want them who ... you know say part for a couple of years\nYou probably save up fifty grand two years without any payments if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out in pulsing riding around on a Sunday afternoon solve this particular property while that one's not going to be there\nOh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do I'm not going to be mad at you either way\nI just couldn't do it there's no way ... is with us in Canada I Ariana how are you\nI ... I can kind of interesting thank you are going to help them along to find like by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my life my pennant I get out\nUm found her own place currently sitting on the entire compact static and has gone down in value my unit is very shifting from LA last night I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm terrified of the units dialing land mine and my other lower\nPriced out of it like it out in LA good\nUh yesterday handling it came on the market I have in mind that get Ninety I asked him\nStarting to feel like the American Peter how because it's sitting empty and when ... coming you know I was thinking I've kept my price to run Ninety four and adding contest that out over paid X months way of kind of\nGot out ... pay five dollars out of pocket on the market is charged but my question is how\nWould you how much we shoot ... out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHow you'd have obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland on it I don't know what I'm going to judge the situation and\nHow quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and uh you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I'm going to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five oh among the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um I Would I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't\n[laughter] you know so you know so at some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but ... but five thousand out of pocket to be done with this two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that too 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worst case county and when the pay is not a place to live in the wintertime\nWell but I mean not only just this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worse three hundred thousand two years from now exactly yeah\nIt's going the wrong way and so it's just trying to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right I I don't think you were panicking what the numbers you're giving me now if you start telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket what thirty grand I'm probably going to wait the winter out you know\nMy put a tenant and wait on spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing good question I'm Sorry you're facing this\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five things for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I've not got over a million
