I think I Would probably like to have an anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us and Pennsylvania Hi Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nUm but uh certainly in jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic\nIt's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world and you're a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them [noise] censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they\nCan monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera um that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some ...\nThe agents to this country and not become a part in the hands of\nThe communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're doing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier that belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used in what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder ... with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you um about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is for the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm [noise] and how that might mean there was there or dominoes at play here obviously and wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states or the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably\nBeen cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these uh donors investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course now they could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are on a much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got a you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is a you know my friend or something like\nThat that the idea being that we we have to have partners in that\nPart of the world it's a dangerous a game of the airplane we see that evolved over the years and Iraq we see it in Syria you know even you know vitamin ... and I would just welcome president how cc of Egypt up into Moscow for his fourth visit in the last couple of\nYears and you know they made big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... uh for these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we abandon the the Saudis now\nUm you know they will run into the arms of putting in putting understands that uh or into the arms of chi into a certain degree that's\nHappening I'm you know we have to recognize and the dark side of the world very bad things happen uh our our own government has been involved over the you know decades and very bad things we don't publicize\nLike Bob ... the interruption again a lot of cutting here will pick us up on the other side Bob McGinnis alliance of evil here's\nSort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented by whites non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nSo we see the pillow race along with the legion we're increasingly starting to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more so you know that sort of suggest that you know even if you said your political\nIdentity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important tea increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer up shocked at the New York times and she's written a piece titled American say their politics do to find them but it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell so you had lots of different identities at any given them and you know you have a radio show you are a man\nA you know you know from a particular part of the country is silly\nIt with your home town and whichever one of those is important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identities over other identities so for example\nA you know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to\nTo say that they want to spend money on social services and that is more important and then worrying about the the federal deficit but political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in while you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences might shift as well I think it's a little bit sort of surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion than we reach\n...

the western part of the state so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation\nBecause everybody's really spread out and I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that why you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher apps and says\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add\nHours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum\nUh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeding the hours there is just basically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to four day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey basically looked at you know the price of marijuana in different cities across the U.S and Canada and compared it and what they found is that a candidate says about thirty percent cheaper\nAnd Canada than it is in the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because campus was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses\nA for many years now and so there's a wider range of dispensaries there's a wider range of producers in Canada and there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that um that wider range of production ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply you know whereas here in the U.S ah you know except for the states where it's\nLegal or illegal at the federal level and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAre so at the medical marijuana been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know\nThey have a very large legal candidates industry in Canada and you know that industry was pretty easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so you know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and\nAnd you know if you if you watch the videos and stuff coming in from candidate folks are kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with ... capacity personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's the cost breakdown is it done it done by adults I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per eighth up and down on that but the measurement they use [noise] whereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of now so you know for for allowing you multiply that out to be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S I'm various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly\nWhere it was most expensive was in San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but nevertheless you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up by dispensaries they're still having to you know set up a whole\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines because the legal at the federal level and so that make things harder and drives up costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say we're all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it'd be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level or you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices in other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada where there is this very robust cannabis industry already in place\nWhich Jacob marketwatch personal finance reporter Jacob ... thirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nShaun Hannity listen on your smartphone with the eye hard radiolab more on line W.
