one set the way you think if you're a millionaire around here\nOne thing we found for sure is millionaires think long term they don't think thank God it's friday oh God it's Monday\nThey're looking out for word\nAnd they're thinking and there's two things that millionaires do they play all fence and they play defense\nAll fans is they do the right things\nTo build the wealth they do the investing to build the wealth you know investing in your mutual funds near four one K. investing and paid for real estate they do these kinds of things the defense is avoiding stupid stuff that cause you to lose everything all the progress you've made\nAnd so that stuff like the right kinds of insurance so we'll all that kind of stuff and so having a good solid financial plan is both all fence and defense and that is one thing we find one of the data points we find when I was millionaires they really good at defense\nOnce you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you got rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just written a car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in early right right you're\nGoing to write the three thousand two hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gum car you know\nAnd um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency for uncovered the call yourself in baby steps to win three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not and um most of the time unless you're close to ... unless

the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the in value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the leash you put those numbers are able to calculate comeback out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn most of the time it's around fourteen percent\nThey call it cost a capital\nAnd they don't have to disclose the interest rate the AP are to you you know if you get a car loan you get this this cruising lending sheet that the Federal Trade commission makes makes them show you the a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not\nThat under the law [noise] and so you 'cause you're renting a car [noise] and so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate [noise] but you can figure it out with a calculator and it'll make you view [noise] I mean it's ridiculous\nThat's why we called leasing is the most expensive way to operate car the car lease is a disaster\nDisaster as a financial
