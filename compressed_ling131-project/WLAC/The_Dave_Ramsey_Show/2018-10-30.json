care [noise] my wife is a physician compensation from insurance companies and one has gone down considerably and we um [noise] we built\nDream home and move them about six and a half years ago and it's it's a wonderful place but we are becoming a house for because of the you know lack\nOf income so long as your household income before and what is it now\nIt was about four eighty and this year it was about two Seventy five\nOkay and most of that is her\nCorrect I work two part time jobs and and care for three children ... and how much do you own your home\n[noise] about eight forty and what is the payment on that\nAre just it's like thirty nine Ninety five is shorter four thousand a month gotcha okay\nNow it's it's um uh it's on the coast of waterways where have you churn keep plugging germs in taxes to soar or monthly you know when you factor in taxes insurance is concerned with hiring a\nGotcha okay All right and you have no other debt or is it\nOh no we have about a hundred and fifty which is a mostly credit cards and student loan okay we've kind of accumulated those credit cards over the last few years of trying to figure out you know whether we were going to\nWork ... research was going to you know return to previous levels and we just don't want to wear house for a longer and on\nThe house is probably worth about a million and a half mhm\nSo we're looking at um [noise] getting house back in town um we actually found one ... that um [noise] if we purchase it it'll be on a Fifteen year and it'll be a little under twenty five percent of our take home okay\nAll right and with with the what I was looking at was with the amount of equity we have in our current all we can pay off every bit of debt we have except for well we'll have I'm a new house which\nAnd still be still be at that number the Fifteen Percent number or the twenty five percent number of Fifteen year\nIt'll be a little bit under actually okay\nThat's what yeah that clears the debt and everything okay a result of the young I'm definitely doing that and um the ... that all sounds like it's very wise uh especially to the extent that you um feel like that this is permanent this change in income is what our men and there's nothing you can do to\nFix it um you know a change in direction with the way he way she practices or what she does or you know what what you know is there a whole new business model that she can go out of practice with the changes but even then if that worked and she got her income back up to a half a million you could buy another house\nPigs that's where I kind of told her I said you know if we if we do the school at Harvard crunch the numbers were going to be fired\nSix thousand a month to the good at minimum yeah yeah and we have a sixteen Thirteen and ten year olds who are looking at more cars the purchase more insurance for cars college is coming up but we we have about three quarters of a million and retirement savings we have five twenty nine scroll through the kids that we've been funding some for you know we have proper insurance\nYou know and I mean again and we don't need to go crazy on kids cars here ... is the thing is I don't want you to move down and\nRelax the pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to look down and keep the pressure on is there a way to get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know ... million ensure fun to make it again\nExactly in the house remove it includes to me is not step down the beautiful house for a ... it's a house that everyone would love to live and it's you know I'm not going to be able to see the sun come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah ... ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna ... we're not going to surrender\nWell not but you only have so given how I had him in high school and I didn't have them for Nineteen years and the only thing that happened after Nineteen years where they gain weight known that when I started again so I'm I'm trying not to open up that might be\nYou know a crush on what do you why now\nSo I weigh about two sixty now\nOkay and you lost forty pounds she said for what\nYou have about forty three pound them and I'm Still going I'm going into still doing going strong laugh\n... okay good news is good for you well done thank you yeah I mean with that kind of pain no you can learn to do a lot of different things that were out there um so I you know 'cause I I'm I'm not only mildly curious about this um\nIn terms of bless your heart the pain you've got but the uh the truth is is that the financial troubles are going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right\nExactly and um I assume you've got health insurance I Do so when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost\nBetween two and a six thousand dollars\nPer yeah okay and what is your household income\nOr about sixty sixty sixty five eight\nYeah and so if you budget twelve thousand a year for medical\nOn out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card debt that were that we we we paid off twenty five thousand we thought about thirty laps so we're we're making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up at the same time\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look let's win this medical battle and not expect huge headway until you do yeah\nBecause you take sixty thousand miles twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm a you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem but if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some\nProgress while you solve this bigger issue then\nAs soon as that's gone\nUm you know you're going to be a new man in so many ways right\nSo I mean I I just cannot see this being something that you go oh twice a year I've a kidney stone for the next forty years out of ... that that just does not uh that's not tenable scenario to me so I I think something is figure it out here along the way\nIn the process I I just can't ... maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard of that but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist I'm not a\nMedical professional by any stretch\nSo um but let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket that ... coming up you know well that's just going to be\nThat is what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back on Bush's er wow ouch ow\nBrooke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how're you\nGuys have cable either but I said I already know the answer here that I was actually calling I was wondering um I don't I mean you mentioned you know you\nWere a lot of school and I had a question even more so I'm back ... aspect you know like I'm twenty four I cut out a little bit of student loan that aren't bad mouthing I charge money they're getting like\nA lot more in grant fact probably won't even have a look at them again and kind of ... I won't be a very I mean I\nKnow I'm trying to work as much as I Know yeah but you have any advice for time magazine like trying to ... twenty four and trying to get like\nSomething about it is also home of all it's like yeah charm watch may they may have already that's only what she looks a little longer school side\nYou know well the first thing you do is your budget obviously your time for ... for your classes\nAnd a new budget your time for your study around your classes and in the new budget work I'm social comes after that I'm most people if they throw a brick through their television they found about thirty hours a week\n\nAnd um that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore\nAnd I'm not mad about television I don't think the devil's in there although he probably is having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that it's not like a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on that gives me my best life\nI'll spend my time on grandbabies children wife\nMe work reading\nOr do you know a long time before I spend my time she'll just being intentional with your time\nYou'll be amazed how much time I mean you know how many ... you'd be amazed how many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\nAnd you talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one so um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually ... almost completely and he turned off your television you can make a pretty good living with that time\nYou know but and the money's in your name remember that we just wrote on the outside of the file mission trip it's your money so there's going to help him do whatever but\nI if there's more than enough in there we'll just do some of the house you can monitor it as you go along and not let it get out of control if it's a little short you can add to it if it's a little over you can uh just skim off of it throw it at the house throw it at the house thrown at the house\nBut you're just ear marking it you're just giving it a name\nOr unintentional name and that way you don't have this vague\nMutual funds sitting up there and you forgot what it is she just right across the top of it but that's what it's for Alexander is with us in Philadelphia Hi Alexander how are you\nA Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nA question for you so my wife and I have one child and for their profits were actively trying to have another and then next year wonderful yeah thank you so the plan would be one baby is born my wife stay home for a year or two not work mhm and then potentially go back to work after that mhm\n[noise] so in terms of the day we have left we just pay off our car yesterday great which is which is a great thing yeah so we're debt free except their house and our student loans mhm\nWe have forty nine thousand in student loans\nAnd between the two of us right now we're pulling in a pretty good income or we're at a hundred and Seventy six\nAnyway what she made she makes one of five boat okay so that's going to be a head\nBut I'm Wondering if it ever get whether this can you live on your income if she comes home up there was no student loan\nUp yes\nOkay let's get rid of student loan and get rid of her to come home and live on your income\nAnd we shouldn't should we hold back more of a reserve no terms of\nNow because we're gonna live on your income is down to live on it yeah\nAnd you know personally is get student loan to undo the next things get the ... stay with your baby steps get your emergency fund on and um you know but if you can't live on your income and you're going to burn through savings as a result of her coming home we got to rethink how we're doing this\nRight right I don't want to build up of savings that I plan to subsidize my lifestyle with\nRight now what kind of lifestyle down to fit my game plan\nUnderstood affects the good and say the good news is once you start thinking about that why start living on your income now\nAnd that's where he's up all of her income to accomplish a whole bunch of goals before by becomes right like
