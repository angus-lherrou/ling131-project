that gets you\nThinking wow so are you\nI Am thirty one\nWall with a townhouse in Seattle what's that worth\nA well we're actually like thirty minutes south of Seattle and yeah I still count that yeah yeah so I Would say if they're around right now I didn't fit the onion forty but when I bought it so it was like around seventies doubled\nOkay wow so you're single\nYes single mom I have two kids um they're eleven and nine so this is just on my income\nTo plow through it as making sixty grand as a single mom with two kids are paid off your house at thirty one years old\nYeah rock star\nSo incredible telling your story what happened four years ago that made you think you could do this\nSo actually my journey started on eight years ago that's what I found you back then I used to um to see the arm and read her book fan I haven't heard\nOne school for business and I think I'm looking for like a book and personal finance and that's when I came upon the little money make over at first when I read ... oh okay this sounds interesting but\nUm and I got into it more I really liked what you had\nI started listening to you and that's when I was like Huck cookie that straight to the point so I started up paying off my credit card that had a little bit of credit card debt and student loan small student loan um like three thousand and then I really got intense on paying off my car which at that time with like twelve thousand\nI'm so that was around eight years I've been on this journey for eight years I've had at my two kids um but people didn't know that I was in a relationship that with toxic it was abusive um both verbal and\nPhysical so I'm\nJust being on the plan helped me kind of set myself up to her I didn't have to be stuck in a relationship\nAnd that particular relationship mhm um\nI started I paid off my car started putting money um and saving the emergency fun 'cause I knew that once you know the relationship ended that I'd be the only one reason you know financially responsible for my kids um which is what happened so five years ago um\nI had an emergency fun I started putting money aside for a house likely I was able to stay with my mom at that time we were staying with my mom um there were some domestic abuse and then and then\nUm but I had set myself up to where I had no debt so they will six months later to purchase the townhouse so that we're kinda started\nYour amazing I think you\nYou're a survivor I don't know if you know this or not there is a very high correlation between extreme levels are financial control and domestic violence\nSo usually if a guy's this big a jerk yeah abusive verbally and physically he also trust or control you through the money in that sounds like what was going on here what am I hearing that right\nYeah oh I'm the one that word so I was able to push you didn't work that the results like bomb so narrow\nDown I read about you got rid of a larger that's awesome [laughter] yeah like like where you lose your checks right here in the loser call\nAnd I have to you know get things to you for putting together this plan so I can\nTell my mom went and did it you're a hero I mean you bus loose from loser bill [laughter] and you go get your car paid off moving with your mom get your emergency fun now you're living in a paid for house just outside Seattle is worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars I wouldn't by the way you're thirty one [laughter] I think you were incredible\nThank you I don't know I Wonder if they think are very um she's like my best friend the ... not really sister but you know motivate or so\nSo uh there's a twenty six year old out there listening okay that doesn't think she's worthy injuries are punching bag for some loser\nTell her she can make it yeah tell her rotten [laughter] you you are listening right now oh gosh\nAnd I found when Kay what\nHello yeah I'm here\nI'm just hearing were voices coming from somewhere else\nOr my wife didn't that that may\nOh oh okay good All right so uh um but the\nThe thirty eight hundred over the eight hundred is not your problem what where are you paying and rent before\nFour hundred\nOkay\nShow four hundred dollars is breaking you guys making thirty eight hundred a month\nWell and that's what I mean I'm having\nWe look at our budget multiple times trying to figure out where we can ... we don't have a vehicle payments we have both our cars are paid off mhm um but\n... medical bills for my daughter are equate to about nine hundred a month [noise] mhm [noise] um\nYou had that where the weather you rented or whether you bought though correct\nThe house didn't didn't change that and when the house changed was four hundred dollars a month\n\nAnd you don't have any do you have any other data other than your home\nOr school loans um we have\nSix thousand dollars in outstanding medical bills who haven't paid yet and then unfortunately uh about five thousand dollars on a credit card\nOkay right well\nYou you you've got a tight budget but this is not um\nYou know the the ... I mean I I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in that okay so if you call me ahead of time I was told you to buy but this house is not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty hundred dollars your house payments Fifteen hundred dollars now we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is way less than a force of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem I think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of\nA a of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and when you're with your baby I mean when you're babies' heart and it just that's just it just wears you down you know it just makes you human her makes you a good daddy and a good mommy\nBut according to the truth is it makes it kinda hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the ... numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys I pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight\nThat you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation you know so\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus ... minus ... minus water doesn't leave a lot of room but you could pay your payments on everything doing that\nAnd then you could pick up your overtime a start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I I think that's the you're just\nYou know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of cloudy and it's this is doable though where you are is doable I I think you can pull it off no I Would not sell your house or would not have bought it because I don't remember telling you buy to buy a house where we got that but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nFor your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you're dead gum writer clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years or\nReally hard work and lots of overtime inside jobs ahead of you yup you sure do are you guys gonna be taken much fancier vacations new you've got a bunch of that\nYou're cleaning it up a ... reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to you and help get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can\nI'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you among baby steps which is pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt because my house I have a six month emergency fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um [noise] I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment cook at all for the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment from my house\n... what's your household income\nUh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand\nSo you could be like debt free in one year if you did the\n\nUm yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nIf your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments would you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments\nKnow same thing in a\nUm I don't follow okay well\nI mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home\nThat's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing as if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing own your home to invest doesn't it got it yeah\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the page or liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you have data over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you have an investment right and all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ...\nAh the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house chagrin investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately reacted but that's a hard thing she that's where that's at risk bark that ... that you're measuring the cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went crazy in your mind right you know\nAnd that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume this was not in a retirement account no penalties right [noise] [noise]\nUh no that that hundred thousand is just ... right yeah it always say is I mean you're talking about the head and the heart or just with the mathematics of it I'm ... years of it if you ... if I if you put risking the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and\nSo and and so your heart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measured amount\nOf ... and so yes I'd take the money out of their house I'll be free in a year and she's actually what I

they survive but more than that yeah they can survive it more than that and again I Want to hear the story around the income you know they just started the job and you know maybe their incomes going

I have on the high end ... uh twelve thousand wow I'm terrified income and um\nSo I Am kind of leaning towards that the higher income with no pets yeah versus the the the lower income just for for our security\nI mean I I ... and again if that's if they don't have an eight hundred dollar car payment or something\nI don't know what else was in the mix the whole story but all things being equal\nYeah

I'm In our marriage with are buying we kept everything kind of minimalist steak mhm um if it broke we fixed it and then it went and\nBought another one on you know just try not to be McHugh materialistic ...\nWe didn't need to buy a lot of clothes or anything like that\nOkay so that's a big thing keeping cost down yeah that's what allowed you to do this what other points do you have for\nGetting out of that oil a definitely you know we live in the age of of excuses you know everybody has an excuse for something and I got a lot of\nAnyway [laughter] yeah I'm\nJust a you know don't make any excuses we've heard a million times you know oh well if we major income we could get edited or if we didn't have kids we could get out of the ... the really anybody can do it\nI mean if people do it of all all strike down here you know\nVery cool yeah that's good that's a good point no excuses just get after it\nYou're going to say hey that's your deals so do your deal you know whatever your deal is do it\nThat that is what was dealt with you ... a good job do you guys are eating wild on we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you as well retire inspired number one bestseller and keep keep tuned into his podcast returns burden that'll keep you on the track to now becoming millionaires and outrageously generous along the way okay thank you well done YouTube\nSo sixty thousand is your take home so that means you're probably making Seventy five eighty give or take okay when you put your twenty five percent tax bracket right now if you were to cash out the Seventeen thousand out of your savings out of your retirement\nThe government is going to charge you a ten percent penalty flush your twenty five percent tax rate\nSo you're going to get kicked in the teeth to the tune of thirty five percent\nSo it's kind of like saying hey Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty five percent interest to pay off my student loan answer would be ... you know\nYou see what I'm saying\nYeah they'd have to lay down\nThe good news is you won the argument the bad news is you both have to read the book again [laughter]\nLA thanks for the call Rick Carruthers your eggs in Fort Lauderdale Florida Hi Rick how're you\nGuys are how are you better than others or what's up\nI'm just calling about a product I have a I bought a while back all the Wii U L\nA very universal life yes\nYes sir Yes sir I'm and I'm not really sure what to do with it I'm not I know I'm not a fan of it but again even when I talk my eyes are on the ins and outs of it I used to walk away confused and not sure what to do with it\nBut that's because of his one of the techniques they used to get people to keep it [laughter] I have some in the dark and feed them little neuro [laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter] so ah\n... the deal is this just a cash value life insurance policy there are three types of his whole life universal very more universal live and just verbal life and a universe alive or variable universal laws and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection the inside of it there's years\nYes enough yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it because you're not seeing good returns [noise]\nNo it's about eight percent returns but all the fees and dove into it I think that it not more yeah\nWell and you usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll net somewhere in the seven range or after fees\nWhich if you just bought the mutual fund you might have made ten or twelve in your case you're making eight and their fees are getting your down probably in the four ranger actually will be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly most things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking in the teeth to the tune of another four or five percent that's when it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable term\nAnd uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy is term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it adjusts up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year\nFor one year it's not the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year\nSo you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay no less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[laughter] I have not okay\nAnd uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't\nGive a crap but here's the math on it I Am", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville",
