online\nOr you can you can get into groups on line and stay you know should continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that\nUm we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff\nAnd it's a really really really incredible value\nAnd uh it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and some day when you're doing really good find the guy who um feels like a product and you help him out\nAnd that's why I'll ask you to do things for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a newer listener forgive me for my ignorance I Am on baby step to we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty four thousand dollars I mean that includes our cars\nWe do not have a mortgage we currently rank now my question is\nUm we're going to have it paid off work and the next few years maybe even a year right now we have a plan that we wanted to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country however we would have to\n... and something to tell us when we feel like kind of have to ask them to her kids are getting older\nI'm terribly would\nNot like to wait if possible but I just want to see what your advice for America would be\nA Sunni dream I like having the dream that's cool very cool well um mugging I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money off on broke people\nRight and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people have you ever tried to sell used RV\nAnd seeing other people all around and most jak possible to get rid of them\nAre they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels motors they are mathematically horrendous\nOr they're just a mess and so um do the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... you can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd uh so you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nI'm sixty thousand\nOkay I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you saw it at someone of a lost at least you got you know what I mean dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have an EU finance it you're going to turn it into a nightmare\nRight it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred grand in an RV but at the time you get home is worth fifty right\nAnd you're going to be stuck in a wing all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and turn it back in\nA doubt there is one there probably is very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different um\nAnd when you add all of this up\nIt might be that you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your SUV or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you out at all up\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on the transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want your dream to be a nightmare so do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got some nights to do that while you're working to get your other debts paid off right now and then if you want to say about fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand thing or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm going to be mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life\nBut if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to win a thanks for the call well was fourteen\nAlmost Fifteen million of you listening each week we know

President Trump started off with an apology to justice Kavanaugh and his family for everything they endured\nModel cattle Amy is with us in Akron, Ohio Hi Amy welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYou how are you better than I deserve what's up while\nI Am kind of the issues going on my um my father in law I recently had a stroke and uh and so he has been in a nursing home for about a month and a half ...\nUm my husband and I are on baby steps sex so we're actually thinking of looking into buying a new house that might have an in law suite so we had maybe do home care at our house within um we're just trying to figure out what\nWould be better financially efficient half our house now which we all about um Ninety thousand on or buy a house\nThe one that we kind of we're looking at on a fellow at like um like around three hundred\nAnd watch her current home worth\nUm it's probably like one fifty per\nSecond move up a hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah and you're using his moving into the father in law suite as the justification for doing that but obviously the whole house that the increase is not all about the father in law suite correct\nYeah we're going to upgrade our house within the next few years anyway what's\nYour home income\nUm it's about two hundred and fifty thousand\nOr you can afford it if you put it on Fifteen year fixed or less\nAll right I'd prefer to live because they don't want your every time you only get paid all start Fifteen Years over again the kind of guy each the purpose right right purpose would be to become a free so is he financially I'm obviously not able to care for himself obviously there's no other family members\nMy husband has a brother um we're kind of a better situation I guess\nTo to take something like that on my father in law does have a pretty\nHe had a decent amount of money so he um he he could keep them in a nursing home for a little while until the money runs out ... ... well\nI mean you may want to shut down um you see capable of making decisions with a stroke\nIs yeah I think they're um mentally and physically it's had a lot so how much money you can you\nSay he's got a fair amount of money\nUm he's probably got like three hundred thousand [noise]\nOkay well I mean you could make a deal with him that if you got your half of the inheritance prior to his death that you would agree to care for him until his death\nAnd go in and get your one fifty and then you go about pay cash for theirselves\nYeah okay\nAnd you know are you would want to clear that with a brother as well everybody needs to be paid just as a kind of stuff this was a law\nSo you're real careful with it and go okay you're still go get your half buddy but we're hours now you know and we're going to care for him and we'll take care of him a but that's a heavy commitment on your old part right and in other words if I were in your shoes the way I wouldn't want to analyze that would be\nIf you reach a point being at home and your husband's at work and you don't want to do this care that you guys would be willing to write the check for the in home care nurse\nMhm yeah I um I think that we'd probably still need a nurse to come in\nAll of it is good that's good\nWell I mean you can decide how you wanna do this but that's one way you could put some of the money together\nAnd not having a little complicated thing where he owns house to house and then you have to deal with your brother in law and when he dies 'cause the now range half your house or half half of your house or some kind of crap like that I don't want to get into a lab that's that's a nightmare but you can\nJust bought a house and go we make two hundred fifty thousand we can afford it and we're gonna put on Fifteen year and you know he can use this hundred and fifty to buy the in home care um however you want to do it that's the way to do it there's nothing wrong with that\nI Would have in my mind you know just your exit strategy is being you know if he gets really in bad shape and you have to put him in a nursing home are we going to handle that\nAnd then number two we gotta get brother in law and everybody needs to be on board on this\nTrack to find a solution they've exploited thousands of timeshare owners this year alone\nThere are the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could

that how did you end up in class\nWell her uh her uncle actually was hosting a financial peace university class and he tried to get us over to his but they were about forty five minutes from us and we decided well we'll just looking for one locally and we found one at our local parish which was a mile down the road so we couldn't say no to that and\nI I basically had to track him to class\nNow are the truth from okay whose article your uncle and it's my uncle or oh okay got you started but then the bottom one close by so he's got no excuse and yet\nThe ... and my brother and sister in law are somewhat in the course of that kind of money made us none of us as well\nGo through the same parachute in and around ... okay All right so everybody's in different places but going through the same time Anton ... very very cool or on the I'll be like you I'd be like you want to do [laughter] than a show how did you talk into going\nAnd it's like you know I think I really thought we needed a third party and kitchen all you want to talk about ways paying off our school debt bang I\nHe thought he knew how to do in fact and and it's hard to hear what he had to say about it and sell ... like me and a third party just to get to get him to class with me I just needed to hear like you you know speak to him\nYou know plan that you both can agree on yeah it's you know you know and you're in\nBoth in sales and mom I been in so my whole life and one thing about so people as we always think working out earners stupidity\nWould just make a little more it'll be okay yeah 'cause you know you'd make a little more when you're ... you know I just got to make a little more than ... ... years of my income will go up and my dad would go up if I had to change something so so Ronnie or what did she say the talked you into going\nThe one thing she just said hey we've got to get on the right page we're we're both on opposite opposite ends of the spectrum ... she was a spender how's the ... and I knew how to develop spreadsheets but I didn't really know how to go about paying this all off\n... instead of strategy and you know that's\nSomething you could buy in to be on the same page been on the same page as a big deal\nWhen we first got married we we were all about buying a house and we got married and twenty sixteen and where we were looking at houses were ready to buy and then we realize we're up to dinner eyeballs I Can't even afford it at all\n[laughter] so shock yeah so we got to do something to do something okay so the spreadsheet nerd who needed a strategy goes to the clash and what did you come out with Romney where you were how what light bulb moment that you have a ha moment where you want oh\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of and\nBecause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much that everybody had and were like wow like ... you know there's a big support group and you know this is a great way would start with the baby steps ...\nAnd we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter bizarro intensity and it really helps how much ah we had about ten thousand and so\nThat was hard for a nerd was Raja\nCheck it out and clean up as soon as it\nMoves takes your breath away so Veronica spend or go to class you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go oh sure I like this ...\nAnd uh they deserve to because look what they've done of the country

your house but you liked the idea of having extra money more\n[noise] we're still not a hundred percent sure on that but you know the idea is there\nI Would I wouldn't do it um how much data you got not counting now\nUm well we have a team my wife had Eighteen thousand on student loans um we have one vehicle for Thirteen thousand I'm about five hundred dollars in credit card that should be done this week and um [noise]\nFive thousand I'm On a second mortgage um that we use when we are just the house um\nAre you make you make eighty thousand you should be done with thirty six thousand under

the house and clear a hundred and you're making eighty starts to be kind of tempting 'cause you're gonna have a long slog but you can knock out already sick so here's what I Would do I think I Would table\nThat decision for now and let's see where you are one year from now after applying the principles you're learning in financial is university\nYes sir\nThen if this time next year you still feel stuck watching it\nBut right now um I don't think you will by the way but if you still feel stuck like you do right now you might reconsider this idea\nBut the numbers I'm hearing I think you can do this and keep your house and I think you've got a good ... let me ask you the last thing as your income trajectory how much you know in the next three years you that your income is going to increase\n[noise] um I actually started a new job next week so modeled jump I'm about five thousand dollars a year I'm at the beginning the next ... my wife so probably spent about the same\nUm and then mom will probably go up another two to three thousand per year um what was the next probably two years\nOkay so you got some some increases coming and that starts to get it back down to that force of your income situation where we want the payment to be you're going to have the wiggle room 'cause you're going to learn to budget and a quarter of this debt and your incomes are going to go up\nWhen you combined those three things are going to have to wiggle room to live the life the margin that you want to live the life you're talking about how little better life\nSo a good question man

handle that and he told me how to go slow and take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having another problem whereas\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like and just beyond lonely I don't know that um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation uh it it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real I'm just so the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPastoral counseling to go with your other counseling get with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect\nIsn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book or synagogue\nI Know you're Jewish okay cool that's perfect then let's get one of the rabbi dude let's get the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that that\nGoes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your face in wonderful on by caused the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you to do because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless and you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some\nCareful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom\nAnd that will be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm\nObviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I\nI I Would make sure I'd really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's a group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you\nUm then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed that they need a group of guys you ain't got a one\nOf my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers in your life a talk with you in these situations so I'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray\nFor him I tell you that and hold on I'll have are picked up we're going

[noise]\nYou know what I've learned after talking to so many people who have been victims of ID theft they feel violated and they have a sense of fear an intrusion can be overwhelming\nIt's scary and infuriating at the same time people question your character you try to figure out how it happened and you worry it's going to happen again then you have to deal with cleaning up the mess bill collectors credit bureaus even the police just make the nightmare worse and trust me id theft is not going away\nThat's why I personally work was Zander insurance to develop an ID theft plan that provides the best protection and value\nSmart strategies to help reduce your risk so you don't feel so helpless along with taking over all the work if you do become a victim and without wasting your

should have a ... I did you do a lot of\nFun so something happened and you're all lived three years and five months ago when a switch flip tell me what happened\nSo a great story but it started five years ago today when we got married or are you good two months after that we decided to buy a house and our debt went from about two hundred and fifty to three hundred and two thousand dollars ... and uh\nWe started on our own path not sharing the debt I was to pay off what I did and she was to pay off her part mhm and I I made a really brilliant decision and I bought a flu on a credit card oh good three hundred dollar\nHuge money argument that wasn't an argument was an ultimatum well he said I'm not doing this again\nThis is a second marriage for both of us and now she had money problems before with her previous mhm and wasn't going to do it again so I said I don't know how to do it but I Know a guy who does\nAnd I let her over to the podcast and that started I wrote\nWhoa very cool very funny shows the flu to broke the camel's back\nThey all had a few\nDaughters from his first marriage and uh she the oldest is going to start band and he went home charged it and I thought\nWhat okay oh well it's

fighter the flu guy but yeah okay whatever [laughter]\nOh hi good oh fun\nVery fun you guys OK so yeah you did look up and you realize last time a one lady told me she said ... when the first one\nShe

to let's fix this so it wasn't a I'm a ...\nThis long drawn out argument but it was kind of just hit the balls at no okay look this way we've got two ways that were there is a way that works in a way that doesn't work why we're doing it doesn't work\nExactly well and I had never really heard of before and I didn't even know how to use a pot cafes even know what a pod cast was and so when Dale charge the flute at the time we kept our finances separate ... and I said we are getting ready to go on a\nVacation Italy ... and I said I Can't do it if you if you have credit card debt ... so we cancel\nThat bowl and I went on a yoga retreat on my own ... in part of that retreat was four hours of meditation and I listen to your\n[laughter]\nAnd I came back and said okay I'm ready to learn that that that want to work we can do this guy and so then you got the books are financial peace university or water just listen to the park gift um mostly we listen to the pot and that's good and then we got the book and then we've let 'em as to you oh okay so I did all all unfold after all\nA very good for you guys well congratulations again how's it feel to have no payments in\nThe world amazing it's hard\nBecause the property is actually owned by the ... you\nThe items are owned by the press if you don't do that then the ... says no benefit that's called funding the trust re titled ... everything you own end of the name of the trust which is a bit expensive two and a lot cumbersome\nUm consequently I was reading in financial planning magazine the other day article that said Seventy eight percent of the ... that are formed a number funded meeting people pay their stupid lawyer their financial advisor thirty five hundred bucks to build the trust and then they never retired all the stuff into the name of trust which means that trust is absolutely nothing it's got nothing in it\nAnd so it's so it's absolutely no value so I don't use living ... uh I don't personally use living trust and I have a substantial network with a lot of detailed estate planning\nNow I Do have some trust I have a couple of trust there are there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing and so now I Would not build trust now you can set up and you have your attorney or stay planning attorney do this not your financial advisor I trust a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your deaths the money if both of you die and yet minor children the money goes into addressed and then it's manage where they go to the children was talking about that in the first segment of the shower\nAnd um or a second second mother is our I guess but you can do that that's that's not that hard to do and it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed in no trust happening unless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age there are no longer legally children emotionally either for that matter but there we go so I mean some of your children that are emotionally still minors but I've grown logically moved on like the guy [laughter]\nThirty Years' old ask him what he did for a living is that I'm a stay at home son [laughter] I'm a stay at our own sun [laughter] what state you're in the street [laughter] my sweaters Mike's in Chicago [laughter] hey my ...\nI'm good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I uh have a baby step too I have a a kind of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a a medical bill that I had a they stopped it was an automatic withdrawal and they stopped taking out and they've sent my account to\nCollections and then to a lawyer uh-huh and refinance some into court mhm I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are what I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do\nHow much is on that bill a Fifteen\nSixty one thousand five hundred and sixty okay and what your household income\nOr about Seventy five thousand dollars for him and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all campaign a hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of credit cards is while student loan so what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills and I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars for\nThem and my daughter just was diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming so how old is your daughter\nAnd a three okay and what were the medical issues or she\nHas a book called ... syndrome a a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy ...\n\nOkay you gotta do you guys have a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's got a few ever since she was ... actually have a lot of things going on [noise] ...\nAnd how much credit card that do you have\nA lawyer probably at twenty five thousand dollars mhm\nAnd how much student loan that they are\nThat ones out there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ... who's the doctor\n[laughter] I'm just a teacher my wife has stayed on my\nCar [noise] All right [noise] um well what normally happens\nIf you have a heart and you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that was that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband\nYou guys can not paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human but his screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right\n[noise] yeah so as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore I'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans if they're not already on hardship to furrow\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars and offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlement they'll take it\nOkay because we called today are very feminine federally call today that you know we ... what can we do and they just said\nUm you can either pay the full amount plugged in court fees and attorney fees or hire a lawyer well if even court\nOkay and you can call them back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle this debt which one do you want to\nBe okay and what if they don't take that and\nYou you keep messing with the national weather and messing with them\nBecause they're gonna listen you're dealing not with an attorney you're probably not even dealing with a paralegal\nYou're dealing with a large law firm that runs medical collections through like a wage it in a factory this is your life at your daughter it's the illness and the struggles it's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them they have no soul there is nothing to this thing except you're just a number on a page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a page they talked to ... thousand people like you every single day and they give everybody the ...\n... family and I just we love the mid west Kansas city and I just I don't think I Want to make that movie I you know I definitely did\nNot have does fine no problem with that but I'm saying is there a competing is there another brand that was your main competitor the ... in that town across town\nNo I mean you'd have to go to a larger city for sure that get a competitor\nOkay uh so I just our or Florida or else guy this guy's a lock on the luxury RV market in your town\nCorrect okay ...\nAre well there there's two things that come to mind is one is um ah well we don't do anything with money you just you got a hundred thirty thousand dollars you sit on it uses love as possible you'd\nTrim down your budget and live on as little as possible you don't touch your four one K. I don't even want you touch them one thirty this casual we can be ...\nUm you know you're really really good shape financially so um you ought to be able to coast as long as you need to um the trick is I don't want you to settle for something [noise] um you know making sixty thousand bucks when you've made to sixty\nUm because you've proven you're worth that over more than a fluke\nOr you did it over a long period of time so we know that you have to\nUm\nUnbelievable world class skills one is you have an in depth knowledge of luxury motor homes and uh how they work and what makes them tick and how you can help somebody in a situation and so on there okay that is a very narrow set of a skills\nIt really has only one application in your city and you lost that job okay the second thing we know is is that you know how to sell large ticket items to wealthy people\nAnd you're very good at it\nAnd so were you for instance to sell 'em\nAshton Martin ... or ... you would be in a similar market and ... the\nDownside is you don't know much about how they work you've never worked on them or so the curve would be but you know how to communicate serve closed the sale handle the service after the sale how a high end luxury buyer wants to be treated and needs to be treated in order to create repeat business\nYou are an expert in that\nAnd I think that set of skills can be applied in other places would you agree\nOr I don't care if you're selling a hundred thousand dollar watches if you want to do that that's fine\nI put so I just came I went to something what wheels on it because you had somewhat wheels or the motor before snow you're mechanically inclined as well so maybe that's it but\nYou know I talked to a guy that I saw in the crowd out of high on cars and he used to be in the um recruiting business she used to sell a you know recruit people for jobs\nAnd it's just similar skill set because he was dealing with high on the executive placement and then he's dealing with a executive placement into cars and it it's the same set of people you're dealing with this thing they think the same way you know how to keep that kind of person moving unhappy\n[noise] and I think if you think if you broaden that out that why do people back off your pan out with your camera angle you'll see that and I think you're going to be fine so I wouldn't panic I'm\nThe only thing I could think of is if you can kind of some kind of brokerage situation where you're brokering high end luxury RVs um for two hundred and fifty grand you can fly in and out of a city ever so often and make a deal happened\nAnd so I mean you could go straight to manufacture or to a dealer of the same brand fired you but it's been a much larger metropolitan area and sell to people\nAll over the nation and hand hold their hands in the process with a broker process I'm done I'm not sure where the leads come from not sure how they deal happens but um when you're dealing with sometimes two or three hundred thousand dollars airplane tickets are cheap\nAnd that makes a deal happen you can't do that when you make and thirty five thousand but in your situation you there's a lot of stuff you can do um I mean you could be gone one night a week and jump around and really close some big deals you could sell a jets private jets\nThat's another thing that would fit perfectly in your scenario um and the job market's pretty hot right now because the economy is booming\nCouldn't give a jet away two years ago and now you can't find one\nShow um it you know that's another place you that you think of a luxury mechanical element that's all I'm doing I'm just brainstorming out loud here I think you've gotta lotta upside potential it may take you six months to land in the right seat and but you got plenty of money you're alright\nGet on a budget watch what you're doing don't don't you're spending come up um but don't don't do something dumb and\nIt was a tenth of what used to making call

change their habits and run the debts back up the only time I tell people moved up into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of
