Kentucky Wildcats night game in Lexington probably gonna be a little chilly it'll be a little jealous I don't mind that don't mind at all reports in the morning I mean is chilling you like that don't you ... you know\nFor us you know when you do practice in the morning a\nMorning night temperatures Joanna ... so\nUh you know when our guys are are going to our guys have already had a precursor to what they're probably going to get on Saturday So\nLike a ... a lot of questions on Twitter a Steve asked a question to ask you about the how do you deal with defensive adjustments for Kentucky's power run game because this is one of those where this is one of the few teams were they just lined up in the wildcat which now back there and say here we go that's what we're going to do\nYeah ... they're they're averaging about non wildcat runs again so a\nDon't use the quarterback\nOr as much as they'll use you know banning I mean there are quarterback Wilson is is is a tremendously Dallas he's a he's adultery quarterback\nWe will see probably more quarterback runs or like in the ballgame than than we've seen all year long because that's a lot of what they they do or you can throw the football has weapons Dorian Baker yeah you know you're still there and and and you know it's\nStill producing for them whether special teams and or as a receiver but um\nAt the running attack it is to provide at the same issues a year ago and you know like for us I think we have some some some answers to what we're going to see but you know for us it's got to be about you know first or second down or you know runs because this is a team that's much different than the teams we play we play\nHave been more along the lines of mixed running past Florida\nUh didn't didn't ask a whole lot you know last week of their quarterback um but but this one will be different just because they have a true test it running back in business now you know a scarlet we're still making his way through it but I this this group is tested and so for us in our jobs are going to be you know can we\nCan we slow slow their run game down on first now because they're just\nYou know ... some names yeah I Know tomorrow's gonna play well Crawford gotta play well or you don't mean key you know the guy that stepped up seats CJ has been flying so I I I think what we're talking about is consistency around\nOkay remember the quarterback and making place for him and critical downs we so that we can continue to move the change we know collage going to drop coverage we don't ... going to drop coverage I'm\nIn the Mesa plays on Saturday or\nJust like a logic to it but we need more guys in other situations that\nThat that don't look like pick a collage of to step up and those guys have done it a practice now we've got to do it in game\nGot a question of ... on Twitter Chuck asked about recruiting three hundred plus pound defensive lineman how difficult is it for you to find guys to fill that position\n[noise] but yeah well the ... we recruited him and they've grown up and you don't like some ... some of those guys are cues okay but football accused now are better are are are better now than they were when they got here yeah but but but not quite ready or\nYou know like for us to continue to keep moving forward I mean it's a process it's not like you just go recruiter three hundred pounder it's like okay but you got to get a guy's to sixty five to Seventy you got to grow up in the program so I'm obviously you know that's what happened when ... ... that's\nOr you know when you go ... or I mean right now when you're looking at at the yo yo cameras and and and\nAt ... guy empty but Josiah\nExercised three hundred and five pounds jak or like when you look at during the ... three hundred pounds but you have to be able to function you can't just be a three hundred thousand you got to be a ... a three hundred\nPound or the nose out of line up and function and so that's what we're we're waiting on and that's that's a process you know it's sun ups and sundown and\nSometimes I won't just a thought in the microwave I'm like Darren is do you in the microwave or\nIt is it they don't work that way yeah\nUh you know for some guys some guys just have to go through the process of learn and continue to get better as they get minimal wraps and\nThat's where we're at so uh it is already get those guys but uh we were working better and we're starting to identify more of like I said you know we talked about staying and I'm sure you can ask some questions about him ... steam was just like at a bus or he was a\nA a guy who was a two way player at St Thomas acquaintance high school he play both old on the line and\nUm and you like them as an opposite attack but the thing that he's shown\nThat would that six five for a minute you know the two hundred Ninety seven pounds\nThat's what we need more so we got to get more of those in and that's what you're going to see in this program probably over the next next or you know year or two\nIt was interesting because he kind of showed up out of nowhere I mean you know two weeks ago all of a sudden he's on the defensive line you know my leg and he ... he was listed as an officer blonde hair was and then he shows up as a de Lima guy now now you're plugging him in he's got a chance to be a significant\nPlayer for you well he does um who buys you a ...\nI think he's I think he's justice towards the\nI'm ... and when you look at him he's alone I'm so those are the USO reminds you of\nThe number three from South Carolina and I think we know him well but yeah but but that's what Steve and can be used to what you enough he plays in high school and I think is best footballs in front of him so\nThat's the blueprint that\nThat we have to follow when we see it now and that's where we got to go\nHow significant is that you you mentioned he played at St Thomas ... which is a ... a powerhouse in Fort Lauderdale if we're both very I I mean it's like how how significant is it to get guys who play at that level at that kind of program I mean it does it mean something doesn't translate the guys who played at that level of high school\nWell it does to me because those guys have done nothing but when a you know when when when you talk about guys you're not you're not trying to teach you how to win he knows that uh with with that\n... they know how to work they understand how hard okay they asked the blind in order to win those championships and so some of that you you you you look for something that the rub off on other young guys and you'll programs um\nYou know for me that's what I'm looking at now I'm\nYou know you you're looking at ... and ... playing behind guys but grants to Ninety five now so you look at Grand a six three and a half two Ninety five and say yourself another young man from saint Thomas acquaintance Frank carpet in St Thomas corners these guys know how to play football and would that\nI think what you're going to see\nRemnants as we get later into the season and some of the stuff's starting to like Frank's playing really good football right now so\nWhen I was starting to see you know from them in practice how they compete and even the young guy like try to stay in his show that you're not gonna take anything from anybody he's he's he he signed up a couple of guys and practice behind\nLiking you know how to get after him so you know when it's all said and done he's got some to them and that's what you're always looking for a good football player\nBen about football brought

D soon well done\nOwn\nYeah and just lean you got to have that guideline everybody does single or married that those boundaries those guard rails and that's what your budget is it tells you what you can spend if you want to get your goals and you have a goal of twenty thousand dollars in one year and so you know I was like Seventeen hundred fifty bucks a month you're going to be paying on his car\nOkay which means you're not going to be doing some of the stuff you're doing now because you want it because you want the car and you want it paid off true yeah\nI mean the show it's just you you just punch it in the face hard and fast hard and fast and you know I I think you can pay it off in a year and I think you should commit to doing that and then save up your emergency fund up three to six months of expenses and save up your down payment for your house I think you can do it\nHold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you right through the baby steps of exactly how to do what I'm Talking about I think you can do this if you read that book it'll show you exactly how to not only get out of that not only get your house but also become wealthy okay\nToby is with us in Topeka, Kansas Hi Toby our you\nI'm All right how 'bout yourself better than I deserve what's up\nHaving a quick question me and my wife are on step to um we plan on being get free within six months in the ... our\nOur goal is within two years to move now we'll beyond step three\nUm and my question is if we come in about five to ten thousand dollar short of our emergency savings fine but yet we sell the house free pretty good profit\n... some of the money from that sell the house into the into the emergency farm in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or how would you want us to go about doing that\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things or she needs a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we be cutting and mayor we'd come up maybe just a little bit short before we want to move but we do need to ...\n... um well you can do what you want to do I mean you're grown up you're allowed to there's no law on any of this but um yes um what what I Do I think when you buy stuff that's not an emergency before you have an emergency fund you are inviting Murphy to move in your spare bedroom\nOkay I think you're asking for trouble when I got an emergency fund in place equity Evan emergencies there was the weirdest thing\nBut as long as I was broke my live looked like a country song\nAnd I thought that I think you're asking for it I'm so no I don't think our bond buying her car's non emergency\nAnd so it does not supersede\nYour ah your need for an emergency fun now if you want to say three to six months of expenses is your emergency bonding you want to say well we're going to get to the three mark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later\nBut we're comfortable with the three months of expenses emergency funds at least until we get her car or whatever these other things are that you're wanting to do that's fine but I bought her cars on emergency\nIt's not she's got a car\nSo that's how we know we don't usually emergency funds or it mark is in Orlando, Florida like Mark how're you\nDoing here near better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my ... been together for about three years or very young and we would like to move on and move forward our lives and get married good Lewin together good ah we don't know over financially stable though and we all want to be smart about it financially ...\nHow old are you Twenty one okay and what do you make\nA about thirty thirty five ear and what's your career ah right now I'm just a warehouse worker okay so what's your plan I yeah I'm sure I ... I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't your career plan\nOr replace our yard and pretend like some young man who's a sharp young guy who's working in the warehouse or Twenty one just walked into your house and want to marry your daughter\nYeah what would you tell him I don't want to know what his dad gummed plan is right Yes sir how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of her like\nHannah I'm giving you a hard time brother okay if you're if you think about it that way if forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her dad that's what he'd be looking at right he'd be saying OK guys a sharp young to\nBe not making anything right now and you work in the warehouse but everybody's got really got a really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nUh she's in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when does she graduated from school chatted about another year and a half two years okay and what were her degree being in\nA she's teaching okay and who should pay well right now her her parents okay\nAlright would they continue that and she could complete and be a teacher while you're married\nTo ask but hopefully I I think they would go down critical then\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part-time income and you're thirty five thousand dollar income knowing that in a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going to more than double you'd be making over Seventy ... close to eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kind of stuff right\nBut with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money and then you've got better prospects 'cause you're going to start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one and start taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one\nAnd fifty one year rich one\n\nSo it makes sense okay there so I think you got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going\nBooks are we going to sell more than it cost us as a result of our having been there and show you know if you're going to get back information and or clients from the wedding expo that makes you more than it cost you to go then that's just running a business you do that all the time\nBut if you're not going to if you don't have a plan to make the money back\nIf you don't have a way to make money as a result of go into that and that is something you may want to rethink so ah but yeah I think you're on the right track I think this was the right way to go for you and your situation to try to get some income coming in but um you know what I'd love to cedars make some money\nBefore you spend so much money and so you're getting some ... was a place of get you're going if that kicks it off and you say well cost me five hundred bucks and I can make five thousand\nBecause of the leads I get there well yeah get all over that you know and that's that you just want to have the thought that through a pow am I going to monetize how am I going to turn this expense this exposure at the conference into money that's what you're looking for\nSo look forward to seeing the November first here in Nashville M.
