it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're both handy I liked him making things I'm going to say I'm gonna say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K.\nDot camera OK okay you you could change it you could get for you could make it eight you can change it later okay but whatever we do\nI'm going to put that in the bank first\nOkay before you start your total money might go okay it's going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I want you to do that and you know it\nSaid to save up for the wedding and then\nNow hey you know and I want you to do that in like too much okay perfect and then two months I wanted passed by Christmas yeah we can do that okay and then we're going to start the debt snowball each individual ie\nDo not run your money together until you're married I Know you said your it's a bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship it's really bad legally because if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay and it's stuff\nLike a car wreck or something weird okay and you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your debt and you're not married it's it's it's a problem and that's really what\nSetting up here so um the the other way you could do this since you've got a whole lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that all\nWell in a sense he's not because of the day we get married it's all combined mhm and so he's not paying for it we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth there's no you paid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah because here's the thing if if he\nUm pays off the eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nYeah and you guys ought to have the wedding\nAnd then we got you to deal with when you get to come home from the honeymoon and okay the actual gonna have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do yeah I Know what I mean she's still going to be there when you get out and the honeymoon they got to get rid of VIX you'll notice over the next year or two but we're hoping yeah the thing is just lay out a plan that both of you agree to\nOkay but please don't I don't want him paying your dad's okay it gets weird\nOkay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that\nYou know it's just possible downside is all there and the upside is very little if you get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and he's debt free and he wants to pay on me that's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks Georgia that\nOkay but then if something God Forbid happen everything's still separated between now and then okay and I'm\nSo cool cool congratulations and we'll send you a wedding gift is

WNYC\nNashville heart radio station\nTo the mid term designed Lisa ... Fox News President Trump expressed the optimism was just over two weeks into the mid term election I think\nYou know the same thing so can you get a Chevrolet education and be fine out here yeah most of us function on that we didn't go to ... schools that were a hundred grand a year your kids aren't going to either unless you're going to run them deeply in debt which I wouldn't recommend so we show you call you know your local\nIn state tuition schools that you think your kids might go to and you find out how much it is\nAnd we have we've gotten a pretty good start on that we have a great program here in Iowa that are high school kids are able to take college courses for free and a lot of are a lot of the kids graduate with not only to high school diploma but also their two year degree at our local community college\nWe are highly inviting them to do that and a lot of that out of the kids are already doing that and taking college classes yeah and I'm going to college you said a community college is free\nWell if you are taking classes while you're in high school it was okay yeah yeah\nWell the other thing you can do is if you don't do that and you graduate from high school you still can go to community college about a third the cost of the typical in state college four year college\nAnd not for two years if you don't have your first two years of stuff studies out of the way does most of that's just core stuff anyway and you just make sure that that community college will transfer full credit into you know I'm I don't know University of Iowa or wherever it is going to go right\nAnd wrong or Iowa State or whatever it is you just look at that and you lay it out and you say this is where we are going to go this is what it's going to cost and then you back into your budgets on it and go okay Seventeen year old we're going to be cash flowing so college choice is your biggest variable in a kid going to college\nDebt free variable number two is they make their part time job filling out for scholarships yeah jump\nOn learning suddenly filling out scholarship money and um you know we're we're meeting parents and kids who were\nYou know that they're they're getting two hundred and fifty twelve hundred and fifty twenty two hundred and fifty dollars scholarships and add them all up in a pile and they turned out to be thirty grand and they pay for school not a bad part time job when you're Seventeen\nAnd you work your butt off filling out black above zillion of those things not ten but hundreds\nOf scholarship applications and you try to get the third thing is you take a class on how to take the ACT not just take the ACT or SAT depending on which ... which applies to your particular situation and get your scores up\n... that a little bit of tutoring or a

event out there like a bunch of folks are very cool is beautiful place now they're not welcome in Africa and you're here to do your debt free scream all the way from the other side of the world Oh absolutely love it how much will be paid off\nIt's about thirty thousand cool and Thirteen men good for you and your range of income during that time start out one is thirty and went to one fifty one thirty one fifty very good what are you all do for a living\nYeah so I'm inland acquisition for a residential home builder and product\nMarketing very good good for you so what kind of debt was the dreaded thirty thousand\nSo it's pretty equally divided between student loans and both of our cars okay and we want to mention that in that Thirteen months we had to hit pause and our debt snowball twice and three months into it on fourth of July\nOr I or I unfortunately we're celebrating the little too much and uh\nApparently I had appendicitis and I thought it was a more than something different so I thought it was bad food\nAnd every ... and I had to get my appendix removed so that put us on a screeching halt yeah wow yeah so that was an emergency surgery that we had to cash so long and we did but everything on pay that off\n... started up again we're back at it filling out our our thermometer and six months later lucky me I had kidney stones so yeah so I had a double whammy yeah the only thing that didn't go with the gall bladder um ones are the sort of their own greater burden on there and I know [laughter]\nI Know that a lot though not\nMargins the appendectomy you almost warrant area oh my goodness\nAnd it happened the kidney stone last two months and the new year so we had to start over ... ... but it can be wearing a stressed out because he knew how much we can pass Ansel long have you been married\nFive years on the December the first\nSo what happened that put you on this journey Thirteen months ago\nWe had our little guy he's too right now that I had just gone back to work some attorney leaf ... and we always plan of big annual trips and\nHaving him without a logo do at Disney cruise or something and\nI are planning that trip and then I kind of stressed out because we only had maybe three thousand savings and then just didn't sound right\nAnd we knew that you are his parents actually given us ... when we got engaged okay Manhattan but it just didn't click back then and then watch them no no well\nAs early as much we know we watch them that we stopped at a ... and just didn't stick to it on a cell and I knew that you went on line found that you had an ad and I had about an hour and a half hour commute each way to work\nNow I listen to your pot cast and I yeah I heard\nYou tell a capital that was on base that too that they ... they can't go to any vacations and that's when it's ... like we can't do any of that stuff we need to really buckle down half our debt so that's when I came home to him and tell them no vacations are going to get started to which he was really excited to hear all the\nSudden a gang or pay out a payoff dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like ooh [laughter] our choice I guess is that\nI I Am but the good news is you're out of debt now and I'm like no one else later you can ... ... there's no what do you tell people the key to getting out of bed as you paid off thirty thousand and Thirteen much\nFor me at that budget sticking to the ... that we never and stuck to it through the ... that only change we knew we had extra cash to redo then spontaneous spending\nAs a planning the for each month happened and loves the every dollar Applebee's at all the time cool and so yeah I just sticking to budget and planning ahead and just delaying send the air and things that you'd want and just waiting on then\nThen for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way that they approach\nA this debt free journey Lindsey over here she's mixed fail guru in geek in loves to see it split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me now they're in\nThe whole thing and get me to the top ... more goal driven in that way that we built it on our end but on the refrigerator right when we went on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in that kind of like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous now this was it\nIt was like hey we're the ... were in debt I\nMay have being honest and I end up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at you like curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nNow as a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and banking on that and I'm like\nEither way you do have I hired a duck to bowl with a nature essay and they lower premium as a result\nBut you'll have to just find out what they're offering do they have a hundred percent pay after the ... um and if they do and you're healthy or you're sick either one it comes out better kind of in the mental it doesn't necessarily come out better\nBut if you're going to go through the ... the doctor will every year and then they pick up a hundred percent that's a great deal if you got like a chronic illness\nAnd or if you're hardly ever sick marked Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up at the dock then in that case obviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the ... so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us and the ability to put money into\nThe health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your duck double or any other\nHealth issues that you want to cover as you go along so good question good to talk to you Annette thank you for calling in genesis one of those businesses in Rochester, Minnesota hot shower you\nAnd your seltzer\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well um my wife and I started your program back in June and um we've been working our way through where in Vegas to um we have some whole life life insurance policies um each of our parents took all\nLife insurance on us when we were younger we still have those policies number we got married we each took out a policy\nFor the whole life um the cash value on their policies as volatile loving housing dollars mhm and we were wondering if we should cash out the policy is after getting her policy\nAnd use that money to put into our that snowball\nAbsolutely\nYeah they're horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has to payday lender of the middle class I mean it just as a\n... a ridiculously low rate of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value of the policy they don't pay the the cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears at death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad\nProduct the math on it is horrendous and uh you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance and who you're investing anywhere except in a life insurance product and so that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\nWould there be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't write the law but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there is no game now yes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an ... with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nOne Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck you don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not taxable event when\nYou lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm In I just got married in August and wear combining our finances and everything else [noise] um\nAnd I can pay off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago hey\nYeah I have nine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great and the next thing we're going to tackle some on mental happy that I ... and then after that was good until the\nMarket's now how can we live and so why planning on saving up for this three to six months of Americans say fine but we're not sure how much we can save\nTwo income family obviously we have no kids on but if both of my tenants leave and my rental property fat out require like a really different amount that if I have that so we're trying to figure out how much it's fair makes sense\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff breakdown on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or a repair I assume you keep a separate account for your rentals do not\nMatch oh ...\nI Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and would pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there put the ... in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rentals 'cause what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxed Boyd cheer\n'em because everything else was going to be deductible all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account\nTo cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that did it that way as separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right okay and then over but then at home I Would have three to six months or expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rental is covered in the rental account than you're okay over there\nUm and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses as you're known as your game plan", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "22"}
