and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and it is Trump's spreads lives and stalks fears ahead of election I thought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic skyrocket graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA hand of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nI continue to study this and try to pick it apart analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media any concern about it\nI Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations\nThese are desperately poor people wasn't her full of people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh saying what Dr balls the Ford\nHow that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic and he's all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for it it's all focus grouped\nIt's poll tested from their perspective\n\nAnd the the obvious there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with\nSeven thousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by his claim they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it's physically not\nPossible so when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking from Honduras\nTo the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\n... obviously is a bunch of left is just that this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan it's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on his massive\nTrump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues\nIn our own individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts\nAnd roll back the things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting Trump feared Trump hatred promoting it exacerbates it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now let me share with you a couple of uh\nStories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight this is the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives\nThe Republicans have only a four team and a half percent chance of keeping the house this is almost identical to five thirty it's forecasting two weeks\nBefore the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent or Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump pan what twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning\nWhich was effectively zero and even on election day through out the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way they're going to go the cook Political Report today his shift in eight\nHouse racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the ...\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall a city or\nIs the story for the morning five ... on TALK radio not point three at Fifteen ten\nThese looking back it's Rush Limbaugh writes a heavier the excellence in broadcasting network where we meet\nAnd surpass audience expectations every day our telephone number if you want to join us eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to email address el rushed ball at\nYeah I'd be net dot US and yes I'm going to get the Obama in Nevada you know the the CNN graphic that's been running all day Trump spreads lives in stokes fear ahead of election\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about mistakes are there is no body in Morocco bombers league\nIn terms of purposely lying to deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average and you won't premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dump\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally\nBe cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change and we later found out course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it\nTried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe in the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lines were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if\nYou control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Benghazi disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of caused the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protect\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else was in on that damn fool decision how about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand ten midterms\nThat Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell where did you think about it was great to go you remember who started or remember who's\nAnd he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up to see him but you're you're so far but neither me can't see you we just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is ... ... for rock Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances have his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe that what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf than if they stabbed aside and let government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years about Obama colluding with Russia on\nGetting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard talking ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir\nTo be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even\nGet rid of more nukes and our stockpiled then I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama that couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand ten\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant and Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media [noise]\nThey've been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid of reality and truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta\nHaving the president whip people up at a rally after rally\nHe says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is it the citizens\nCNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job is covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two guys make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally having the part of the United states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man where has this guy been to the Trump whipping people up at a rally after rally in\nI think people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can give you got all kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well\n\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou're thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudge and Ford say for body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton deplorable Z like Hillary Clinton ... says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they have done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past him kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning the promise\nTo do this that and the other they get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are electing properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support they've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nTheir Jemma cost in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week\nOr longer and he can't stand it after all his\nHard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling from the lies and you keep falling for the hate yeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday\nThe citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pass it anymore\nBut what is troubling as the ... behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as far as to who believes and he does it I think because it's still works it's still rile people up that divides us horribly ... yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear they have the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now who believes this he does it I think because it's still works\nAt sea so Trump promised he pretty smart Trump knows when he's Trump knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you were fooled and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working his son got like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to want peace\nThat I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at\nYale his specialty is computer science ... Williams cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... letter way back when computer science professor at Yale\nChief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from MySpace Amri being us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased prince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast well the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist for future generations that Kavanaugh fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole cabinet episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persisted with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this or go Lerner says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday left just pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... the only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America does folks [noise] nothing every leftist hates\nAmerica but the leftists I Know right to go work at ...\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is access\nIt'll they hate his mistrust of intellectual they hate his love of simple ideas that work they hate\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life is short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in vans and uses\n[noise] I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the chain of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical he claimed to despise Trump's\n\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he is certainty that America is decent then exceptional\nThey hate certainty that's what I\nHave found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nModern intellectual cheapens his learning with politics is proud to bury his teaching with a broken down to the left wing junk\n[noise] David Gardner computer science professor at Yale\nBasically basically saying the real problem a real problem is all you people voted for Trump you continue to\nIgnore your betters you're ignoring the Democrats are ignoring the never Trump or his you are ignoring the media who are trying to warn you\nBut you persist and go to the Trump rallies they can't stand it\nThat's why they make up these stories about gigantic blue waves sweeping you out of the ways sweeping\nYour candidates out of the way they can't wait for you to except they're the ones that are losing ...\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin they can't win these elections that\nThey've been hoping and praying when ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up we'll get another lying to themselves about the future are going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do what is there going to investigate Trump Nancy Pelosi can't help herself she's bragging talking about the subpoena power\nIs that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump and the people that work for him brought up under investigation for two years instead of real life on the ground improving the way it is is this what the Democrats immediate really think it's just what they left wing candidates really believe\nThat the American people are so filled with rain ... Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated\nThey want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out that Trump cheated against Hillary with Russia they're still obsessed with the stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen from them\nAnd now it's time to make it All right\nAnd they are convinced you\nWhat Trump investigated too and they're\nJust fit to be tied to heaven persuade you to join them so now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation\nThat consists of a majority of angry deranged lunatics in order to get\nWhat they the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying\nTo create right in front of our eyes\nBackup land back in the morning today on TALK radio Ninety three and then the ... the\n\nTime now to get to the phones at once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start\nIn a ... Ohio David Europe first today high\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening\nTo NPR and Steve [laughter] hey a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water\nSo they use the mob they don't want to say mommy here's what whatever it is to them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster that there's\nYou know thousands of the line well and they couldn't even see the end of the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to use that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can do for\nWe've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh\nAbout the only time I registered NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said\nUh for the audience and and that happens while I get the soundbites\nOn that maybe once every two or three weeks\n[laughter] a lot of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\n\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and ah [noise] ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day this item to leave and they\nJust they just they just they just because they're human beings we just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying we're talking about Trump being you know an S. obese screwed Trump Trump's Hitler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated and designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood into the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing [noise]\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of\nWhat's this guy's Jorge way most are Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell ... what is it ... right and he's standing\nThere as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you want to run in to\n[noise]\nYou know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and he's voting for\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want\nLife and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how would the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching\nHim that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nFor somebody in a drive by just suggest that Trump of the Republicans might actually be behind this\nLike quote Trump from his rally last night the Democrats don't care what they're extremist immigration agenda will duty or neighborhoods or your hospitals are your schools they don't care that the mess calming will totally bankrupt our country\nAnd then they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered the germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats asked if the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them a\nMemo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on that immigration was vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\n[noise] when when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media wouldn't be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway\nWhether people show up in a group detour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in that are worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense that it has this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put\nYourself in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times are trumpeting post\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's the co loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been God's so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop jump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them now I got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats\nTo win back the house they have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked that thing it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're\nJust fit to be tied\nOver it they're at their wits candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really don't\nBelieve is a good one of your personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh\nAnd Russia on your smartphone with the IRA radio as\nMy friends I enjoy things that

collapse\nAnd then the left will be there to rebuild it in their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out\nAnd that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying\nThe United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's up I think another a microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun it illustrates America\nIs by itself in wealth and prosperity and we owe it to the rest of the world to share and it's not fair we have so much should they have so little and they live so relatively close\n\nDon't doubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America or the purposes of trans forming it into the kind of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to accomplish thank goodness now [noise]\nNew York times a night or may not does not determine gender what what is this about what why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population is not even one percent here\nAnd yet has become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American left and the American media for what purpose\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically meaningless\n[noise] are you kidding me determining whether somebody's male or female determined by a person's genitals is old fashioned\nIs no longer applicable and needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by sensible scientists\nSo this is the party of sites a Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and climate change\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed\nSaid that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge quote Dr\nJosh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea that a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby\nAnd your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male ... not necessarily\nThe same thing when you have a baby that has female genital yet but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again is the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant and durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand that in two thousand Eighteen it is hard wired if is biological it is not entirely hormonal and we don't have\nIdentified dean so we cannot specifically say that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender\nShe has a in studies of twins if one is transgender the other is far\nMore likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here\nThat's also in the this is NBC News\nUS President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were influx of he aims to protect the country after a report than his administration was considering defining janitor as male or female based on genocide failed at birth\nAnd that drew wide spread condemnation Trump's as we have a lot of different concepts right now\nA lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now asked about a campaign promise to protect the L G B. T. Q. humidity Trump said I'm protecting everybody\nI Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York\nTimes on Sunday the Trump Administration would narrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth and it would be on changeable later in life\n[noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simple eighth and yet very controversial you explain what's going on here\nThis is all politics\nPure and simple total politics disguised as something else\nThe Democratic party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd is in the process of trying to normalize them all by enshrine ing them as policy planks ... issues in the Democrat Party platform\nAnd this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population being given the whole white\nThe Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority it ended up being bullied into submission\n[noise] I have I have long believed that\nI just didn't have a I had not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it but I finally did and I really do believe that there are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues\nThat are then used as a as as\nThe joined the list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledge the government to deal with other government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition into an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys political issue status\nTo things that\nWe learned we can sell all of our policy or do you part of it with no future payments Qunu we sold our policy now we can relax and

we're talking about ... an infinitesimal a small percentage of the American\nPopulation and yet it has become a has its own ... which was\nPlanted an established by the Obama administration way back in two thousand sixty for what\nPurpose how does it work well one of the way we now have left us doctors\nAcknowledging the need for this semi important who's by saying that\nBiology alone is not enough to determine\nSomeone's young\nJenna tail you're alone is not enough is the so now it's going to enter it has entered the scene as a bona fide political issue which has all the requirements and have people who discriminate\nHas had people who are insensitive as people who are biased against them versus those over here\n[noise] it it it gets so\nWhy why would they know they're not in society you want to bring them in the mind and we need assistance in silver laughed gathers people\nAnd get together to assume the role of of championing causes which isn't a cause there is no blatant discrimination there is no blatant\nBigotry or any of this what happens is that people are minding their own business one day and confronted with the fact that a guy wants to use a girl's bathroom on the basis that he's not really a guy and we in society I told you got to put up with it you got to tolerate it you can't discriminate you\nCan't beat my but what but but but but it doesn't make any sense the guys that guy was\nWhile he doesn't think he's the guy that's the yeah until it gets in there\nAnd this has been been blown up now and what I mean is they take you get enough I'm telling you get enough\nUnstable groups of people and properly motivate them\nAnd convince them that you're going to get the government to fix this and get even with the people who are mistreating I mean you can create if you if you think of it this way as a group enough large enough to join the rest of your coalition that they'll go out and help you win elections it's it's\nThere's no doubt what this is in Trump's instincts on this are right on the money the idea\nThat you can determine gender [noise]\nBy Jennifer Taylor is an so\n[noise] I'm doing the Sean Hannity they rush happening right here on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a pen W. L. A. [noise]\nTry this one more way why is trans gender stuff in the news anyway\nOaks\nNormalizing psychosis is what the modern day Democratic Party has been about what what is what is more fitting proof of what we have been saying about how the Democratic agenda is driven by people with mental disorders and and uh when I say this\nI say this with all compassion towards people with mental disorders the Democrat Party is converting those mental disorders and really lying to these people they're converting these mental disorders which needs to be treated by\nProfessionals are converting them into political issues they're whipping up a bunch of anger and they're convincing these people that the mental disorder is really the result of Republican conservative mistreatment and lack of government sympathy and so they're going to get even with people are going to get whatever is troubling people fits that are going to punish people who are responsible for it\nThe Democrats used Kavanaugh to whip up the women's vote\nThe Democrats think that every one of their voter groups can be whipped up into action by pointing out the mistreatment of conservatives Republicans or what have you\nThey are using immigration and this caravan mob to whip up the Hispanic vote because they can see the Hispanic voter approval for Trump is skyrocketing\nThey are using the show ... story to try to whip up the Muslim and Middle Eastern votes and of course the journalist vote which they don't have to do much whipping up there because they own the journalist boat but all of these issues are being used to focus hatred on Donald Trump\nAnd to try to convince people to Trump is responsible for all of these things and a half people so upset and so angry and now they're using transgender to whip up again vote and and other related people in the Democratic party who are running around thinking that life is filled with nothing but unfair discrimination\nYou just you wait let's see you wait till the first male conservative Republican candidate decides to self identify as a woman\nTo get votes and let's see how tolerant the drive by media and the rest of the Democrats are when a transgender conservative pops up if such thing\nWhat happened [noise]\nYou just wait and see what kind of tolerance they just like there's tolerance for black conservatives and there's tolerance for females who are not feminists that you know how that works out and there is not any tolerance for homosexuals who are not part of the leftist meant\nIf you will [noise] by the way my parents [noise]\nThat the Honduran president told him that Venezuela is funding this mob say Breitbart story vice president Mike Pence that I saw the Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told him that the migrant mob\n... toward the U.S Mexico border is financed by Venezuela\nNow I've got serious quite Venezuelans have any money but I take that back I take that back the Venezuelan government it's Michael sorry [laughter] [noise]\nIt's the Venezuelan people that don't have anything because the government has it all my bad Venezuela couldn't be funding this now\nHence may be allegation while defending Trump's assertion that middle Easterners make up part why by the white why is have you noticed that Dr buys are outraged by that Trump is saying that there is some Middle East there are some middle Easterners in this caravan they'd been identified we've got people down there and better than this thing\nThere are people from all over the place in this caravan they're not just from Honduras Guatemala and they're not just Hispanic or Latino but why get mad about that\nWhat what what's the point to me that there's middle Easterners or why wasn't why does the median go bad crazy trying to deny that\nWhat's wrong with middle Easterners being in a caravan to destroy us immigration system\n\nHas made this allegation while defending Trump's assertion in an interview with Robert Costa of the Washington Post Pence said it's\nInconceivable that there are not people admitted Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward the border\nIn the last fiscal year we apprehended more than ten terrorists and suspected terrorists in our southern border from countries referred to in the lexicon as other than my uncle that means from the middle east region\nVice president then revealed that her name just told him the leftist groups from Venezuela organized the caravan financed by Venezuela to challenge our sovereignty\nAnd challenge our borders
