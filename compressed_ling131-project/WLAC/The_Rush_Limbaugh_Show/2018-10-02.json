that tell you what what [laughter]\nWhat what what's going on\nHarry ... are so many races that are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada\nTennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate now in the ... not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house I don't think so but if they do it and it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to walk to convict if the Republicans hold a senator even swelled the ranks\nSo the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their\nBlue wave red wave in the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave being generic ballot advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans but you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm going to leave your little scientist observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on\nThis and back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve point advantage\nAnd that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots rarely might do it frequently I but I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for the meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody obscene and it was not a big race is not allow the players to make friends leave that Senate wages on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops and at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bets\nHas the final turn ... stops the tape but the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line\nMakes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is\nFinish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time third quarter finish do your job\nSame thing here holes in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media\nWhich is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh news so how relevant could've been answered none ... zero not up [noise]\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had\nThis in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out\nNow all of a sudden house races are tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final turn and take over\n[noise] well\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we\nDon't want anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night [noise] now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be self\nLadies and gentlemen I Am the reason he's saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat production in mind one by blood drive buys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I started predicting on Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting in all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can that they live on just said they were gonna lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the

... seat [noise]\nWelcome back Fox Rush Limbaugh executing assigned donated flawlessly as is the case [noise]\nEach and every busy broadcast day [noise]\nOkay for those of you watching on the digital camera I Want to show you something for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's no cameras at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I show you this there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the Nineteen Ninety two I was at some local talk shows but\nCNN's they only cable out and there's no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh already really conservative websites start everything's starting to ... to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still it for years after our founding\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right\nFor Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh I I was limited was not going to accept that would challenge the White House ought to be issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia\nShortwave radio this is the by the way it was ...\nEvidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this liberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht\nI think it was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying\nA dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine gutted the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what I was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford and judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter\nSame cartoonist is back some public and the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching on the digital camera this is the cartoon it has Kevin ... daughter praying at her bedside\n\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kavanaugh's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\n\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember it will be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vital\nIt's filthy it's dirty and disgusting it's despicable and it's sick and of course has accomplished it's objective it's gone viral and people have seen that people are reacting to it\nAnd I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets an I decided to go ahead and do it\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh Kevin ... says another prayer dear God\nForgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just good flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\n\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in our lives of suffered psychological just of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nSo don't dumped me on this I'm sure that these people in the media you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power and that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some to the quick it disturbs them\nAny time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high Justin on CNN NBC News\nDesperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia NBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie's sweat\n\nUnable to independently corroborate sweating its claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweating ticket parties with capital they can't find anybody can place or there\nBut she says she was a tenant parties where capital and his buddies running rape trains gang rape trains they can't find anybody who saw what sweating it was a college student when Kevin on his buddies rifles students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school party and\nI keep going back to gang rapes if that's what's happened to these parties or lawyers center that\nHer lawyer said that she was doing research yeah Julie sweat and they kept going to these gang rape parties\nTo gather evidence to do research but NBC and believe me they are looking NBC can't find anybody\nWho says they saw swipe Nick at parties with Kavanaugh Kavanaugh has said he doesn't know sweat Nick and has called her claims a farce\n\nEx boyfriend says what next threatened to kill here's an unborn baby was exaggerating everything look Julie sweat next is incredible just like Christine foreigners incredible\nWhen salt me about a year but been through a thousand times for nobody she says was there says they were she doesn't aware when she doesn't know what she said afterwards or how she got home she doesn't know anything other than to have an auditor no credibility a neighbor to sweat neck\nSo sweating isn't credible Ford is Anita Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible there is no credibility\nThe allegations side of this entire Kavanaugh story\n\nLast night on Laura Ingraham show on Fox News Julie swipe next ex boyfriend or Richard Venice the\nDetails why the third Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable ministry says that swept Nick never mentioned having been sexually assaulted the him the ex boyfriend who Julie sweat Nick at third woman to make on collaborated lurid allegations against Kevin all told Fox

who we have an audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtles in\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if I catalogue perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rapist nasty throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe's a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah I'd make Fridays
