{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "I have a retirement income generator option inside of your four one K. and that's where especially if you're above fifty nine and a\nYou have some choices and your ... even though you're still working\nSo let me just stress this if you're\nWorking and you're above fifty nine and a\nMost plans allow you to move money out of your four one K. and they called that it in service distribution will touch on that next week as well because I Want to stay on this guaranteed income\nUh facet because like you mentioned your your grandpa was in the peak of if I'm not mistaken he was in Kansas yeah see ... and it was a and mine was in Wisconsin and he worked for board and milk and they had a penchant so they didn't have to worry about this this guaranteed income stream 'cause the company took care of it\nWill companies don't do that anymore because pensions got very very expensive\nThe other thing that happens with some of these pensions they don't want folks to be aware of so this guaranteed income stream years gone\nBy our grandfathers both had are rigged because the company\nGave it to us or gave it to them not to us gave it to our grandparents today we don't have that the other thing that's that's a little bit alarming that I Know I kind of want to throw this out there but it won't be able to get too too scared\nToo afraid but a pensions do get under funded and they do become a big can become insolvent they are insured by something called the pension guarantee association says the PGA and\nBut they're saying that with the ... the solvency of some of these pensions is it's scary\nWell we've certainly seen in New York some of the union is there that that all of a sudden they're like well we don't have any more money\nWe're out your your your pension is gone and that if you went into retirement thinking you're going to have an extra two grand a month and all of a sudden that's gone that's a big deal Dallas police and fire there having those challenges as well and really it's a lot of it going back to what you talked about earlier returns the pension plans said oh sure this teacher pension or this police and fire engine\nYou were going to probably average seven eight nine percent so we're good the problem is when they're getting two and three percent now it's not meeting what they were expecting and it's put them into a world of hurt really\nExactly which gets passed on to consumers gets passed on to the the people I have another a really really quick story I'll Try and make a quick anyhow uh when I was in Chicago so I've been to Nashville since two thousand seven prior to that I grew up in Chicago and\nAh I had two different clients that I remember sitting with with one of them and we sat down and we're going through stuff and in our first meeting of course you know we do this the fire such as you call it was we're having this conversation or John I'm\nI'm a United Airlines captain\nYou know so he had a little bit of an ego he thought he was pretty hot\nDo too and um you know so he was he was very very confidence building which is great for an airline captain but he said I have a pension from United Airlines that's going to pay me ten thousand dollars a month I don't need to be concerned about guaranteeing my income I don't need any of that I don't need a plan\nAnd I said to him I said Jerry you do need a plan and you need to diversify some of this stuff 'cause I have seen stuff happen to pensions\nAnd he's like well I don't believe that well if you go back in the history books Twenty years we could look back because this deal fine young man his name is Gerry I'm he did have a pension for ten thousand dollars a month but then what happened United went bankrupt\nWhen you went bankrupt it also drained on their pension fund for some reason because his pension went down to two thousand dollars a month\nSo Jerry did come back and thank us and he was very appreciative because we did diversify some of his other money and help them have other income stream so he worked out and it was fine but that\nWas a bad time and Jerry's life so\nHe was eight thousand dollars monthly income hard one to overcome right\nThere was like before before that we always thought pensions were guaranteed has got to come in forever 'cause the company is going to take care of me we don't have that any more companies do big companies big corporations are concerned about profits and they want to bring money in and that's what they're going to do because they have to satisfy the shareholders\nSo you've got to be on the lookout to make sure you take care of yourself you also want to work with people who are tied to a corporation so I'll give myself a blood real quick and and not only me I'm going to say seek out the independents\nWho are not working for the big financial corporations because they will then more often than not put your goals dreams wishes ahead of their own independent individual people\nTypically have a tendency to be more objective especially if they're registered investment advisor was a fiduciary responsibility so I Can't stress that enough words if you go to some of these other places doesn't make them wrong and I'm not bashing them I'm just saying they may not have your best interest of mine so be aware of your pension they can go bankrupt\nFind out places or or seek out places and experts that can help you balance out that portfolio and and protect against that pension\nSo glad you're with us today for retired federal

and that story I get\nThat many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lying separatist inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what\nTrump that her anyway Trump that her that she had to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA\nTest and he wanted to present her ... have or take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate future debate and that's\nWhat he meant that she wouldn't do any better that she wouldn't show up at the Indian if she did\nDo it but you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and for out the American left and I have I have developed an even\nGreater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion in my mind\nDubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate\nBut then if you look at the reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all and two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nThe Democrat Party glossed over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships are you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost\nWell over a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead set lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep big never going to wipe out\nThe Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't have had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set a gaffe they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue\nTo lose to the point that after the two thousand six need elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\n\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they hadn't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nIraq Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear\nEvery day is this coming blue wave this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped\nThe trend the people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them\nWhy it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democrat Party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look\nAt Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against that\nIn common sense there is no real Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see the widely reported it was the ... [laughter] probably would see him be ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave\nIn two thousand eight ten\nIs this the CNBC polar survey America is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today\nThe actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employers\nCan set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying for none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy\nBy it or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a federal Lincoln bit of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nFor those of you shouting at me why but we're we're storing food so we won the popular vote by three\nAnd there are no contracts get ten percent are simply say usa dot com that's simply safe usa dot com\nHi Michelle mountain here one of the biggest outrageous I reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit caused now how the woman goes into a funny\nComes on data there is no police report I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover\nUp we had instructions natural course of the gods now movie is amazing Cormac God's know is perhaps the most ...
