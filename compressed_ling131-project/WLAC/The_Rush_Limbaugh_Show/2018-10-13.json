{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Well when you quit working that's no longer the situation so now your daily uh I guess your daily activities your daily habits are now changing as well that's a little bit of a hurdle for some\nOf that is for sure I mean every everything is changing in I think you know we've we've kind of created a scene here the today show or talking a little bit about procrastination as well so\nYou know it's we procrastinate on some of these ideas of ah you know what are we going to retire we're never going to you know what's gonna happen emotionally him I said I'm not going to be going to the same place what am I going to do with my time I'm\nIn is the fear of the unknown so I I just want to stress that for crashed a nation again is going to be a killer so don't procrastinate it's never too young to start looking at\nAnd asking some of these questions and sitting down with someone and saying OK what am I going to do after I retire what's it going to look like or how am I going to spend my time or what or how much income do I need\nAll great questions but don't kick the can down the street and you know you and you and I were talking just a second ago you know off the air but and then you had a great story which will include it also it has a great outcome 'cause I did not know that you had\nStaged for melanoma on your on your back until we were talking about it and that's that is a great correlation to procrastination so I'm going to see you up for a few seconds and say tell tell everybody what\nThere might be some good inside for people who are there because of a malignant melanoma and I didn't I stood in the doorway it at my job talking with people in offices and I would scratch my back\nOn the doorway and this this thing was right in the middle of my back and it was you know melanoma is typically are looked like a mold and they start changing shapes and so when you have something on your body that's changing shapes and then another aspect of that is they typically itch\nSo well that's why should the doorway try back for two years well finally I go in because I'm like nothing's getting bigger and bigger I think I probably need to do something so I finally did but it's like two years later see it because you are just you ... center in my back could not go see it\nBecause it was just a feeling we're back to them the right right just the feeling okay and so I go to the doctor and um I mean there was this a crazy story at the end of the day but basically I go in and the doctor that I sit down with is\nYou know ... you know understand doctors that deal with cancer I mean I cannot I Can't imagine the emotional and the stress that they go through all the time because a lot of times it's not a great story\nAnd so the guy that I'm sitting down with us going okay well we can do chemo we can do radiation I go I thought a melanoma you just kind of cut it out and hope you got it\nYeah well we're certainly going to cut it out but we need to start thinking about some of the treatment process and I'm like OK let's guys really stressed the next time I come back with a different doctor\nAnd he goes yeah he's on he's taking a leave of absence he just you know he's trying to do everything he could to make people live basically and he just distressed we've got overwhelming\nAnd the guy that I sat down with it was like man I'm really excited to see you because you're really in good health and you know you sit in the waiting room of a cancer office and New York man people are really have a tough and I'm thinking man I got it made well then the positive was they did cut it out it was a stage for and I got lucky 'cause it grew out not inward\nIf it had grown in safe for would not have been a very good situation because\nMelanoma is are really bad obviously and so the so I have a buddy of mine that came and he said he knew I'd had a malignant melanoma\nAnd he goes I got a thing on my ankle and when it's kind of changing it it's just a little bit I go just go to the doctor they'll cut it out no big deal don't wait don't across in a trailer that's forgot about the morals of the story and so he did he went in they cut it out and it turns out it was it was a malignant melanoma but they caught it so fast that that never gone anywhere\nThat's the challenge with melanoma was when you let them wait they start traveling other places and that's when you add scenarios happened\nAnd so you know the the moral of the story it would be if you have something that's a mole or something that starts changing shape Senate it just go to the doctor it's no big deal for them just to chop it out yeah and so I got really lucky I mean there's no question about it I mean this was twelve Thirteen fourteen years\nTo go and I wouldn't have made it two years probably it but it actually grown in as opposed to out\nYeah well thank goodness un thanks good you know you took the step St ... now\nI did to wait a while to take that you don't wait a while and then\nAnd it worked out here I mean that the wedding\nAnd I've now been able to give people advice on hey don't don't mess around with that now and I'm going to correlate\nThat because now it is a positive story but I wanted you to share that just because\nThere are other people that are going through that same thing I mean we all have different stuff and we got to take that step so whether we're talking about retirement are going to the doctor\nYou know they all kind of come into play as a user when we talk about creating a great retirement we you know we always talk about your health and we talk about your money and we talk about what you're going to do with your time in your life and your love\nAnd so don't procrastinate on any of them you know take that step in and\nDo you get the cancer cut out or figure out the answer for retirement or let's look at what your income number isn't all these things are a again things that we shouldn't kicked down the street pressure so\nI'm going to mention one thing to mark that uh you know we're looking to work with a hundred people and I've got fifty eight folks right now that I work at fifty eight families and I'm trying to get to a hundred once I get to a hundred\nI'm not taking any more clients so I'd rather go deep was a hundred people than scratch the surface with thousands of people and that that's important to be so I Want to impact people's lives in a positive way\nSo if we decided to go to the next step again because it's it's something we're both gonna feel each other out and see if it makes sense the next step is for us to to really begin to look at\nWhere are your assets how much are you paying fees what kind of risk are you taking\nOut to these compared to what the goals you're trying to achieve\nThen we also look at health care we look at income needs we look at uh all of the investments and we look at 'em you know taxes of course we want to make sure we talk about taxes and then we also look at a little bit of that state planning about how things look in the in the future so we do the next step in our process is really just\nGathering the information from you I go back and take an hour and a half two hours in give us a good overview of what's working in your portfolio and what's not working I'm not making recommendations at that time I'm just going to say hey giving you the information of what really is happening inside so it's like you're under the doctors you'd mentioned\nThis is your blood work so I'm getting all of your blood work done if we're going to correlate it to the medical field and say okay here's what I see here's where we are so then you come back in for a second meeting and I'll share the results of the blood work with you the results of all of our financial analysis\nWe say okay do we want to go to the next step if we go to the next up we're going to look at creating a plan and a strategy to help you great to life you want to live [noise]\nStep after that is implementation then we start to talk about tools whereas I think most people in the industry if you're going to go sit with somebody right away there talking stocks bonds mutual funds ... gifts all these other things that stuff is important it's very very important but it's not unimportant on the first meeting\nThat's the last minute so I Would just suggest if if that sounds like it's interesting do you give us a call six one five six five six zero zero nine nine will figure out our next step journal call you back on Monday morning set up a time and uh [noise]\nAgain see if it makes sense to go to the next step non threatening [noise] it's a nice chat\nWe can call the fireside chat but I Want you to have a good image on your picture that's\nA negative image because if it really is a\nAn easy an easy thing that we\nSell the phone number again is six months or\nSix five six zero zero

is back on American soil after two years of captivity in Turkey you arrive this afternoon and joined base Andrews near Washington and deported immediately for an Oval Office meeting with President Trump Fox's Garrett tiny is that the White House\nMaxine Waters is out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there in your what Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist is totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not\nThink that this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them well let me put it this way\nIf we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me that\nIt would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all [noise] some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder\nThat's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly the ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote intimate [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea\nWell we don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh more than ... during the election\nIt is a interesting question though well any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away\nAnd I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left you have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad insane crazy percolating\nCompounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen and his cabinet situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\n\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her policy wants to see\nThe F. B. I. documents released\nShe wants a full fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabin or they're going to investigate even getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging\nIn what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I Know it's not even tried like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... I don't I don't want to fall back on that the suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think\nIt is\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats as large elected Democrats really are unaware\nOf the impression these people are creating about them and when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters they are identified with the Democrat Party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that\nI can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not\n[noise] but for those that don't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe ah the party have large here's J Christian Adams writing is PJ Media Kavanaugh foes fills Senate gallery was sounds of being saying\nSo but as any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always unhinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited hospitals for the seriously\nMentally ill endless shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery whereas on and on earth waiting as anything I ever heard in side a mental hospital they echoed off the halls in ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning with dude\nAnd then the role was called it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting howling screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage was hate\nIt was poisons in Illinois\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment\nTo themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is and the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all this kind\nOf discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections in fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is\nWhat's going to further inspire more discordant madness\nWhich will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in to uh not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics envy and same face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get\nMore rabbit\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen that get the more fired up than they are\nSteven cold

way to explain this\n\nNow folks to show you how deranged is is I have in the stack today I have a\nTwo maybe three what I Would call teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to cap and all but they the pieces\nTo say what all of this means for America and of course for the for the Democrats and much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this\nBecause it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is or isn't John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know what this pieces about this piece is about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because the ... the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers and Democrats and Republicans walk home over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of ...\nBut I don't know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their side to a bunch of

being a prisoner in Turkey for two years Fox's Julian Turner was more\nThe generic ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a it's it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in the CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to\nPlus Thirteen that I I just I maybe it's my desire maybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus a left the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe\nThat after the last two to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent wants to Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven\nIn Ninety percent of auto elections there exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was an election certainly to the ... exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't\nI don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are the answer to what ails America\nNow the dry buys want everybody to see it that way so they reported that way in their generic Paul the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen\nMargin advantage but then you look at individual racism and nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise] and then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents\nDisapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\nEven though the Democrats on the surface would seem to have public opinion on their son\nSays the Washington Examiner just thirty six\nPercent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved\nOf further breakdown\nFinds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved other\n\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrower fifty three and a thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independents disapproving everybody did it\nYou know being ... [noise] I\nCan't prove anything all I have to go on a experience\nGuided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct\nI'd just died on everybody believes this blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story drudge for example links links to on his page is a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide\nRetaking the house of representatives and there are stories where Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast\nBig mark you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual Paul's visual nine percent of their nine seed advantage even after the worst happens with all that that's getting into the in the English I'm I'm just talking about over all national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people that they get everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at American the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action now I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly act and I'm concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies\nYou can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and those sized crowds Obama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen\nHillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two\nThousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies\nTo her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton according to draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows but\nSeriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to\nJealousy and that'll be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made a speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would\nBe that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons the daily wire has the story\nWashington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide stadium\nTour taking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this ball it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and

ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sudden the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly already leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\n\nSome I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe is okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine feet firmly already Leming Democrat I guess this is according to polling data two hundred and Eighteen is a number of seats unique in for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSo\nTwo hundred seats familiar leading Democrat I mean this\nIf the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nOr just the issues and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have any insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans\nI don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by this stuff I'm telling you it is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats\nAre publishing stories to each other that too\nSee sort of leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is any thing one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this ... with the party now the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump\nThat the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night\nTo thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started Lee says he separated families at the border I'm Glad you
