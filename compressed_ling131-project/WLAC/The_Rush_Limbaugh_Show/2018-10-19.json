I Can't I got an email from a friend of mine last night\nWho just beside themselves over the fact that Republicans might lose the house he is convinced this guy's a former New York liberal by the way he reformed about Twenty years ago\nHe can't he can't he's having\nTrouble dealing with the possibility that the Democrats might win the house he's having trouble dealing with the fact that the majority of American people might want\nThat I understand I agree with him completely\nDoesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves in the Kavanaugh situation\nBut that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable who have used the political system\nTo fix whatever problems they have the or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose of government it really is you take all of this that's happening domestically and when you synthesize it now when you boil\nIt all down to its essence it's about the role of government and it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependence grown up in a mass thinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution\nThe solution that the Democratic voters want is punishment for people they think are responsible for the misery of marijuana ... why would we want that\nTo triumph\nWhat we don't but in the in the in the mission to bring that about here comes this ... story and as far as the drive by shooting concerned it's an open an opportunity\nTo blast theme Trump to damage Trump the ultimate aim is to get Trump the cave in a band in Saudi Arabia\nNot it's not that the drive by have anything on that Saudi Arabia is just to get Trump the cave period just just just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump into going against his instincts\nThey've been trying to do that since the campaign they have failed practically every effort they've made their die\nTo be able to say they pressure Trump into doing something you didn't want to do because he's afraid of them\nAnd they think they're getting close when Trump's out there saying yeah it looks like a show ... died looks like it's a pretty good ... ... they think they're getting close and they're all jammed up in their own tree and they're all getting more jazz [noise] for this that's why we tells you hook is yoga is\nNot because anybody thinks he deserves to die but the media never tells you the truth about anything\nNot anymore not work concerns Trump how many of you think let me see\n[noise] I Wish that were true I have tried to make that a fundamental issue in people's minds literal insanity\nThe psychological disorders and I mean that with every essence of my being I think much of the Democratic party agenda has derived from their voters being psychologically\nScrewed up they are suffering psychological disorders because of things that have happened to them in their lives and they want to blame the country part they want to blame the patriarch and they want to blame the founding\nBut then they they they claimed that the only fix for it is the government punishing the people that did whatever happened to these people\nAnd the Democratic party has embraced all of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd has tried to normalize them all\nBy enshrine ing them as policy planks in the Democratic party platform if you will\nAnd that's how we end up with people or represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nGiving the whole way of the Democrat Party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which the otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have tried to ... ... even before but it's specifically sense the capital of hearings to make the point that that's what we're up against and that's what it's going to end up trying thing and women if the Democrats win the house all of that abnormality is going to achieve power at when they have the power\nTo actually implement their forms of punishment\nAgainst groups of people they blame for whatever is wrong and their lives these are not people that are things that can fix things themselves they're not people that they've not been rain this way the Democratic party does not promote that kind of thing in human behavior Democratic Party is\nHappy to help them blame others happy to make them think they have no hope\nThat the deck is stacked against them because of whatever their skin color or sexual orientation their their their gender identity\nTheir religion whatever Democratic Party is helpful in making all these people believe they are justified in thinking that life is miserable because of all these horrible other people what they've done to them\nAnd then the Democratic party to let us fix it for you we'll become your champions will punish these people for you and they\nDemocratic voter base go yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examined every Democrat constituency group\nThat they've been representing the last take your ... ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups have become happy\nHave had their issues addressed and fixed or are they as miserable as they've always been are they is angry as they've always been if not more so\nAre they still complaining today about things they were complaining about injustice discrimination or mistreatment that they've been complaining about for fifty years what have the Democrat Party done to fix any of this\nAnswer is nothing although the Democratic party has done it's best to punish\nPeople who are not Democrats and pillows the has recently suggested that there's more of that on tap if the Democrats will people that don't vote for them and they'll go along women are going to suffer the consequences she said\nBut the Democrats have tried to punish all these people but it is not made their voters any happier\nThere isn't any happiness\nOn the left you can't find any there is no laughter there is no enjoyment that why do we\nWant them winning on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen than W well ac [noise]\nHey before we get to the audio

I'm Sorry to interrupt you serve but if I may quickly I became a Pittsburgh Steeler fan December twenty third Nineteen Seventy two which was the immaculate reception and I've listened to you since Nineteen Ninety One but I don't recall ever you know and I'm sure you have but I was curious about uh the initial way that you became\nA single I Move to Pittsburgh I left home my first job away from home was when I was twenty Nineteen Seventy one I moved to Pittsburg that's a a a suburban station called McKee's port\nAnd I worked there for a year and a Half Men went to a an ABC owned and operated station in Pittsburgh when I got the Pittsburgh it's Twenty years old and\nThe closest football team to ride growing up was the St Louis cardinals and they they were very rare [laughter] I really I I was a baseball fan not ... I like football watched it now and then it was not really into it but I got caught up\nAs a as a resident of Pittsburgh when that dynasty was warming I got caught up in it and I was\nThere here Nineteen Seventy five and I just got I I like everybody in that Pence amazing to me that's where I first involved the theory of how the performance of a sports team can have some\nDoesn't surprise you at all does it not not\nNot when the media is promoting that's how it\nAs middle name Kennedy\nThey're promoting his good looks promoting the woman I think that promote well I mean if you're going to promote Kennedy's you're going to promote it all I'm not accusing about all of that but if you're going to say hey I'm just like the Kennedys then you've got to be in just like the Kennedys stay away from sixty nine Oldsmobile Z\nOn bridges ... not a single person voting for Beto can tell you one of these issues because it doesn't matter\nAnd in many of these other places the Democrats are running on issues that are not at the forefront of people's minds or they are on the wrong side\nBut if you're really stop to think about it mob behavior bullying\nThe appearance of insane rage an anger is all they have left they don't have any issues or policies to run on for the same old reason they can't be honest or they've got plenty of policies all they got plenty issues\nAll they have plenty of ideas they just don't dare tell anybody what they are\nNot at the run up to election time\nThey have no leaders to rally behind him in ... well well look at the presidential front runners of this party\nJob bite me\nCrazy Bernie who is losing popularity and if you haven't heard Hillary Clinton has all but made it official she is running again in twenty twenty\n\nHillary Clinton a two time loser wants to go for the trifecta\nAnd I'm telling you there are a lot of people at the Democratic party hierarchy particularly in the media who don't want her anywhere near a presidential campaign again Kamala Harris big walk by the time the microscopes get to her\nWe're going to find out how really intellectually vacant that woman actually is and the same thing with Cory Spartacus Booker\nThese people survive on the image and reputation built by the drive by media but when the time comes to find out what really goes on between their ears you learn that it isn't much\nThey're frustrated because they've tried everything they tend to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has\nThrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with failure\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort to get\nDonald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and the twenties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're\nPaying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty\nFour seven and the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump and yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump\nI I don't think what this has been about a simply waiting until Republicans lose an election such as the midterms I think they've actually sought to have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what Mueller's about that's what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box in twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House\nThat has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the arranged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush same pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not\nTwo years down the road day how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth say they want him out of office every day now the failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Kristin balls e forward\nThat was a two for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future\nNo problem that's what they were trying to do Christie in Boise for Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then Townsend as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes\nThat was an issue that was ever investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nShooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go\nHow big a star or did they turn camera hog into\nAnd where is he now and where is the issue of gun control where is this story and that young people\nHigh school and college students had had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the in Iraq where\nIs that the day what [noise] but oh\nCamera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\n[noise] just an email from a man I understand the sentiment out there but I'm not sure that's quite right up\nNew York post New York post just published headline migrants caravan heading for us turns around and Mexico you've seen this anywhere else\nI have it's not on drugs yeah um so I I report this to you with a little bit of caution\nThe caravan of Honduran migrants have turned around today a day after reaching the ... the amount of border according to a report what's the system as a poster poster\nIt's an AP story the or support thousand migrants fled their lives in poverty in violence in the Central American country with the hope to make it they were born in ... nothing about this is organic you know Trump's right to ask who's paying for this who is mindless food\nWho is buying the water and distributing and who's paying for the gasoline for the vehicles being used where are these people are taking care of Hi Jenny\nRequirements for those of you and real into where they pulled me\nYou've seen them got any port a potties trailing along in the ... all of this stuff has to be accounted for you're going to bring forth thousand people\nGotta eat they got to drink\nThey've gotta have some shelter at some point who is\nBehind this and we're going to find out we're going to find out what the thing about this I'm I'm trying to when I was hoping we speculated about this yesterday somebody in the Democrats' side wants this to happen\nI'm trying to figure out how this caravan let's say they get to the border and storm the border and just run across well how do they think that helps the Democrats unless it's just the pictures of chaos they think\nThey're gonna redound negatively the Trump anyway\nOkay I look I promise I promise soundbites and your phone calls are coming up after this break I\nGolf Glenn Beck weekday morning today on TALK radio not even going three I'm being banned W well I think that's right that's right the course of course if I said we're back\nOpen line friday Rush Limbaugh to Springfield, Illinois Todd ... thank you sir Hi\nRochelle are you today sir no good really good ... do you remember when you have to take cell phones up front because they cost so much do you\nUh when I used to take cell phones or ... what do you mean\nYou would you would put them at the top of the line because it costs so much for\nOh yeah oh yeah we that's right because we ... we the eight hundred number didn't apply there's no phone cellphone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way and I are way back then I ... back you go I\nI've been way back before that even so uh but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nLast two years there's only one\nThing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income complex caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that for this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds wanted leave or one of these things to keep the government going that got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say that these are smarter than than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they said that your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding lives zone with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump pass a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over or\nI don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly right\nAnd right there that's what's for\nIn the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts of the Trump is still up against the fact that\nLeaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he is a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be ongoing or a before now I I\nThey are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets I I think first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd\nIt it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because of the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy and the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story\nOn the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a ... left Saudi Arabia after having met when king sol mom and Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince either floated may call\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of

Senate might be working at least temporarily to ease the brewing immigration crisis house of the border Fox's racial Sutherland live in Washington\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory and then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibility that they do get to the border and do cross that they wouldn't be separated\nAnd that's the one of all those issues that I went through in the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that wouldn't dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine was one of us\n\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children mothers in their heads\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff's as Russia's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is okay arrest the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for just rush the pictures look bad we've got to do something pictures Louis oh my gosh\nI I was the guy was smart enough to know that he was falling for a media trick\nBut at the pictures with what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people\nComplain to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know what's still very hard to predict Kevin off feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats relief blue there\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things but I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity start this process if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the set of because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite lit up\nThe Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a answered ... Julie ... cohost out there talking to a famed Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins\nAbout my comment than deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nWhere you are not buying into these are scenario hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't count votes like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats as another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place until the on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break you\nLet me run through them and see this is stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or\nI mean there's just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious\nOf of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion\nAnd their desired outcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve and the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election as you've as a sixteen a dentist\n... party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone [noise]\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nHim [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and the lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the\nJustice associated with the Democrats are doing as landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country and they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a\nCouple of weeks they tried it Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went on for like a land balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in that continued\nTo try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggest that trend voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are not the same as a presidential race\nWith a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim\nA wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think they're coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomena ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voters the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve killed and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason\nWhy one was one ball game this is not a single pulled out of the shows this happened precisely my\nPoint it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten people in D.C living die by him\n[noise] their gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington\nEach and every I I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after not\nToo long I
