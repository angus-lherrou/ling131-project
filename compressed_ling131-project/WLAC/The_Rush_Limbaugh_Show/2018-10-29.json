is\nBlame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump and frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed\nUp with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nTo say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years\n[laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do anything they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this\nThis anger and if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that we're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do\nWhenever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by media is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump [noise]\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans\nOr Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths

change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going to pretend the rats at least two things up\nTo try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\n\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up and just somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but that doesn't ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tuned out they're fed up with being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out\nAnd you think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the

your Democrats are demanding at Trump tone it now did you love it when Trump said I have sounded down if you want me totally backup I Will\nDonald Trump was elected to be different Donald Trump was elected because people were fed up\nWith politics as usual I must tell you this people set up a politics\nSee the Democrats in the media politicizing everything it's not going to send people running the Democratic party\nQuite the opposite of what the media thanks to\nThe media and the Democrats obviously think that the majority of the American people want to see the country the way the Democrats do throughout the lens of everything being political\nAnd people don't want to see it that way\nThe Democrats in the media telling Trump to tone it down but they tone nothing down themselves what was it the mayor of Baltimore said the protesters we need to give them space to destroy\nWe need to stand back and let them get it under their system\nThey say nothing when the Republicans were gunned down they abuse power to hide Hillary's crimes to fix elections\nIran's silent coups against the duly elected president\nSo the left wants Trump to tone down his efforts at self defense that's what Trump is doing he's assaulted he said countless times if I'm here I'm going to hit back\nWhen Trump is blamed for the actions of a lunatic he's told to be more dignified remain silent be like Mitt

there is no evidence for which forced opposing witnesses candy but the place themselves at the place because the victim doesn't know where it happened doesn't when it happened\nBut it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh exposed to sit back and just take he's just see those are the old rules of Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\n\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump did not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to what they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down toward\nThis thing happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control law cancer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount\nOf shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that's kept but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun accept any circumstance but but but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a [noise] Trump himself that says this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit seem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\n\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] an anti\nSemitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise and that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground\nThe worst part is that the rightful

great to have you here with us\nThanking Russia I mean if something rash where we need it when that little thing when when they ... they have their little team got Obama was up to his eyeballs in hard core anti Semite like Al Sharpton in out of the White House over a hundred times\nTalking here Don extent in that hard core anti Semitic church Jeremiah Wright's church and then that\nPhotograph of Obama yeah with that world class Jew hater or lower sour kind of well\nWhat they say when you ask them that\nYou know I don't what what do you think they're going to say rush what do you what do you think they're going to say that they didn't have a damn well that's\nRight and they're never going to they're never going to they're not that Obama was their guy Obama was who they think they are\nRight yeah ... well spoken highly educated reasonable academic intellectual\nUm and in look in the leftist world the only African Americans who can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on or by around ... much like foreign ...\nPreach on that and I and I just\nI couldn't take it anymore you know it it's not even my religion and\nNot worry that my limit by it was was that rabbi conditioning was he was he suggesting that the congregation as Jews\nHad to sign on to the Al Gore climate change premise that that was part of not not the Jewish faith but then if you did well described joy that maybe you wouldn't be welcome\nI don't think he when he when he was a fostering an atmosphere where he wouldn't be welcomed but I I think you know\nIt's just the pilot association of everything right absolutely\nThat wouldn't have happened in the entire time I grew up I mean part time I ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grow up and military synagogue my dad was in the air force that there was never politics never came current events dead but not politics\nLet me ask you this was a thing like ... or in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe parents' opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but could could have said that they were I mean because one of them\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also\nTell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think as a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThird willing they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else\n[laughter] well one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it's it's a Jewish state and yet there is there's so much anti Israeli\nSentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti the religion and it's not anti Iran they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's in the religion is high but religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're\nJewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal\nYou're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out now with the disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel's doing that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics disassociated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside a religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an Orthodox Jew and other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used to I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheism I Need the the they're anti Christian too um I don't\nSee them as necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I got\nJust ... that's exactly right this is where this is all headed this is all headed toward atheism anti God that's exactly what is the unifying the people on the Web or whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is toward atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes Emmy judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else that there is no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of ones that's been one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say\nThat you are there's all the liberalism the decrease in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism your writers it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis has been in Pittsburgh that it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on is you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't I don't feel like\nThat there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews and the way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I think that that these are isolated incidents in this country that causes the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else um\nI I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I\nAnd I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nAm glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and they're predominant by thank you thank you so much a\nRe July preserves racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say\nA dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord do I say this\nSeems or psychopathic and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember\nAnd even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second half happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump\nI have I have an\nEntirely different fits why I did the show open today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people do abandon Trump and it hasn't happens to these two events come along and they provide this ... this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting they're asking the president\nWhat he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of no after going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes place a Web says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place the president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponents Congress writes the laws\nBut the idea\nThat Washington is should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants with the White House\nFor my forte from [noise]\nThe battle of who we can bring\n\nHere we go to somebody for eight eight eight and nine just illustrate what happened on ABC yesterday here is stepping up\nAcross social media hate speech and anti Semitism are rampant and on the rise all against the backdrop of the ugliest political climate in modern times at the center and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nTraditional norms of civility they do know the Trump is a reactionary he's reacting to the way they treat him\nYeah there may be\nBlame to go around on both sides here but for the media to totally claim they've got nothing to do with this is absurd now here's Matthew Dowd this guy formally and George W.\nBush Republican now he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to rid us of much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Methodist\nOh yes he says oh Trump's fault all of this is Trump's fault\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact you they they damn well one of the things they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but they don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what

I used to think of the guy that was a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance\nThinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nGone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of what what will people asking what what what happened to Max Boot\n[noise] and now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah come Portman just isn't\nPresent control and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment ... so he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media

tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour that Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected and\nPrecisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's kinda understand\nA little one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about him that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but Trump dead\nAnd so they all start laughing as they miss guys can't be serious he is not gonna last this

observations about the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yes now I\nI normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they sat this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the Farrah Khan turned my comments\nI'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue more than one person commented that if we started this went out with it and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense\nBecause of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive they never worried about where is this going to end\nBut if you if you do things you can give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to then all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where's it it's absurd where where's that hadn't\nYet my thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school since that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the ... the lapses you'll you we we have gun free zones schools now you can't put guns in their only people getting with guns or the bad guys you people up\n[noise] um the left thinks that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left as the problems all the presidents of guns mean [noise]\nThe people involved there'll be um\nA joined me Sean Hannity today is
