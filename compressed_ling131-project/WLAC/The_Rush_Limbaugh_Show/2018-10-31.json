isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what pulled you look at I don't care what professional here talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break eat our way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling data the polling data versus two thousand sixty not all that ... nobody knows\nBottom line\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a girl do you know why I think it was was it two thousand fourteen\nTwo thousand twelve was one of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that feet won the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he's in the tunnel\nSince that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were

eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against\nYou and what you believe in and what you want to happen\nListen today\nThat white men are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic economy\nUh to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now Rick haven't can they get unfair benefits and so forth and so on and so this this is the culture wars that we are in and this is the side\nThat's why this stuff is all crucial\nBacks weekday mornings at eight find talk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W well easy [noise]\nOkay listen to it again this is Monday Night on CNN taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon lending ... women says it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy bad and that that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's data on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary\nEvidence to the primary example are exhibit of their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the\nSteps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins\nNow it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize everybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at right medic continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching\nMedia responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that notice\nHow quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for it on their own ways\nThe result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is that that's an raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good news then decency of America it's quite the exact opposite incidents these people\nAre of a vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics you mean Don like the followers of black lives\nMatter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters\nAnd look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they missed reading their racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand six team\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or are they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrats voting bloc Muslim Americans in\nGreat longer hear it again someday if it's not just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down two days ago and I recall that last plane went down in Malaysia\nCNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went\nThat yeah where did it go down\nIn ... Taiwan there about a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe it's going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there is no way to link it to Trump that good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that\nCrash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking the hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't\nCare about it because it has no impact and has no usage they can see\nAffecting the outcome they wanting to mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when the other side of the time to attack a corporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just trying to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN they were there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there and this was that was pre Trump and the ... the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes\nAirliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where it is a damn thing where is it Don women\nEven asked a former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... percent we remember that Americans have programs like well okay ... ... but they they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nConsumers that any other business out there\nAny other retail business I think the news business has people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does don't know if one\nI don't know of a business who ... who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit now Davis is assuming\nAn operating on the assumption ... whenever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if that momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline than wire Trump's rallies still ... over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Ford miners\nYeah Ford myself thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies plan between now\nAnd election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh attitude or anything\nOf the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis was you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on election day and I don't believe everybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe what do you not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close I mean we don't know we never know until the aftermath here's Trump tweeting out at\nPaul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nIt's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth than there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweet\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea\nOf the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nIt's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says\nWhy let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why is it why isn't it why isn't it a problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great\nPiece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact of capital is spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any but\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that cabinet was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets ... got the confirmation vote and is in ...\nAnd then why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credit mentally and all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political none\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that\nThere is a big campaign going Kevin I was a big rally in point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house so why isn't the media asking\nEvery Democrat candidate running for office their opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made public\nThing I'd do it terrify here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kavanaugh are imposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election if this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back\nOn the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time we have to be network got all kinds of ways to remind people love what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who\nDid it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost in their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story wasn't really\nI mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women\nAnd A R D I hate

great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much closer to my call\nI was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class cause courses because I couldn't handle how they had Wi Fi is American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration is a general book probably gets about one paragraph\nBut most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way the Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship especially looking after I used to take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go\nThey made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that no one to ship Dr performed his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor\nReally did a thorough exam if you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that could not work\nWas not healthy and watch not strong\nYou realize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had\nStreets then I heard the streets were paper with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page in the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will hold a lot of everybody not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shut it to think about kind of history he's going to be learning it's um I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books\nOh wow you know very was\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history books all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nDid a survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in an American history the name that\nWant to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zinn as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nVast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again because images\n... has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one way thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice and Alice I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process now we were much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth\nAnd it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness we we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had\nTo demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America it wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nOh from us from Marsha Blackburn a John Rose no better Marsha Blackburn and John Rhodes will keep your tax dollars from paying

but I ... what do you think you'll never guess ... if I told you every new product that they announced you still would not guess what got\nThe loudest and most sustained applause of any announcement are you ready when apple announced that the new ... book is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one more than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled\nIt just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people have been brainwashed into propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer units made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes\nNow let's go to the audio soundbites vis vis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last

asking him not to come\nOh wait we're not through we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center and\nNow I'm a lot of the first lady and if Monica Trump gets to love to\nThank you very rainy

Ninety eight three ten Fifteen ten W well lazy [noise] wells\nCNN was the first to do it a month ago CNN declared the Democrats have won the house because one of the polls Nancy Pelosi\nIs declaring victory in the battle of the house she was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night and set up until today I wouldn't have said in the election were held today we were when but what I'm saying now as we were when we when we will win the house\nNancy Pelosi\nEverybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four a and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but\nIn mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because there's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen they ended up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most\nHeralded analysts and it's all\nPresenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the renowned poll analysts\nAnd data analyst there is Sean ...\n\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out the four pages bought the headline hear uncertainties in the womb as men terms and her final stretch\nAnd I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing on certain days alone is midterms that her final stretch the twenty eight\nTen men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close you can take weeks to finish counting ballots\nIn California the consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree\nOkay so here he says in the second paragraph it's over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten next paragraph at the same time\nThis isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't\nBother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are going up a two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know those are my where it's not just a trend days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other couldn't be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr\nTrend day here is we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... to ... you can think of where it might turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality penny as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president is job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race than there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't isn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here leads to reexamine things [noise]\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia seven and all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how 'bout viable aren't on the lake\nAnd then the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately\nThey can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over we're not counting votes yet so we now is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day\nLargely irrelevant which is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August them the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so we're going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate go competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh them\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of surprises regardless of whether that happens\n\nWe are well set up for such as the venture out on the bottom line I happen to us why this idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognizes one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up with as much intelligence analysis you can muster\nAs free as the apple store Google Play now you can use the up to upgrade to rush twenty four seven membership and get extras daily podcast it'll come videos and never miss another word from the mayor of real bill you are listening to the men were listen while you weren't\nHi I'm ...
