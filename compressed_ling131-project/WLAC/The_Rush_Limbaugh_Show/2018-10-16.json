Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga both deserve an Oscar and nobody deserves an Oscar 'cause you have to go [laughter] you know what I mean I don't wish that on anything\nYou're punishing both at least they should be punished or with an Oscar no they're they're just phenomenal he is is good at singing as she is acting it's incredible\nUh and uh\nJust a great sir I saw it with my wife on friday and we went in there was a whole row of forty something year old woman women\nAre all coming in with a glass of wine or and uh\nIt wasn't pretty it was in pretty uh you know they just wanted him with his shirt off and uh it just was it they would stop and they drink and they drank and they drink and they drank and uh when we walked out I'm not going to give away anything but it it happens in his home in the garage with the last couple of scenes\nAnd you know it's it's kind of the climax of the whole movie and a and you you know it it kind of is a threat that we was throughout the entire movie okay and they were standing in the lobby on the end the going\nOut on it that isn't what happened a garage\nAnd they and they are like and the other was like I don't\nUnderstand it [laughter] I'm like\nOh [laughter] how did you eat they were just so blasted ... says\nWhy you did see him with his shirt off so that was good for them to stay away from alcohol yeah I could do some really good you should see it um yeah uh and uh it did is doing very well\nOr at least as far as the reviews go people are talking about it as a big time Oscar movie have you seen what is it first in the first man first man have you seen that I haven't um do I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding the movie ... which I mean we talked about when the story came out\nThat they didn't put the scene of them planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of\nThe story I mean but the the argument was not is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches or the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rockets and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's an odd choice I thought\nYou know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you\nPut it in the movie I mean it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah um but ... now and I've not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and\nFirst of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they think insight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like the patch or yeah which would you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you I'm not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag\nPlanted in the mood in the background already been planted there and they show it if somebody to avoiding the flag they just don't have that moment\nNot good enough what if those forty year old women are they like sent her to\nAgain and [laughter] I was there already [laughter] it is some kind of ... and\nAre a couple of bottles of chard and hey you might not understand that but I mean\nAre we not just the victim here of of\nOf the ... the outrage like it did not seem to be a thing no it most of it's not most of it now is this okay today there's a tweet from Donald Trump oh did he say something crazy of course they did is a tweet from Donald Trump today we're also talking about a war in Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee heritage\nWhy why he does this matter I mean you know again we have the Saudi Arabia thing going on that as much more important I mean not to mention that we are going to hit a trillion dollars in debt again\nFor this year another trillion dollars in debt there's no sign of that letting off despite the fact that we're in a good economy were were were popping out a trillion plus on the books when unemployment rate is almost at full employment we're almost at the peak of our employment situation\nWe are at a point where we are the stock market despite a couple of bad days this week\nA has been raging for a very long time\nA housing prices are up everything you know everything is ... pointing in the right direction and we're still throwing a trillion dollars on the fire [noise]\nI'm just put this up for this new banner from CNN the disappearance of journalists puts spotlight on Trump's business ties in San ... that he is because candidate Trump talked about uh doing business with the\nSaudi Arabian yes he's talked about that for a very long my gosh are you kidding me now that the only reason why they care about the Saudi Arabians they forget about you forget about gas prices forget about the economy forget about the tech sector forget about all of that\nThis is just another way for them to talk about Donald Trump don't play that game just don't play that game\nI Wish I cared about anything in the world as much as CNN cares about what Donald Trump tweets\nI mean there are absolutely chemically obsessed with this man they are it's it's incredible\nChemically addicted\nBreak the shell\nAnd unfortunately the one who loses in that is them\nOf Native American DNA Carlos de boost among say use samples from Mexico called parole and Columbia you have to stand in for Native American\nThey didn't even task Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation that he simply is not used to hasn't I mean it nobody else liked the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and it got it precisely\nBy holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment a Kevin all the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and one in four of them\nSay they want to be

Glenn Beck weekday mornings today on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and a Fifteen van double the ... the [noise]\nI don't even think [noise]\nAnd I didn't hear about it I don't think any of the

Feinstein Hillary Clinton Stormy Daniels she's the one I couldn't think of their lives have been more and\nAll four of them\nAre just raided damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted when the different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people twenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown\nAnd again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her the Stanford\nUniversity researcher who studied focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA\nThe Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr Carlos ... use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true is she's an MD she got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\nI mean it's laughable it is the static and I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself ... they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no it was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer or self an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are soon to be barking on what a stadium chore\nOr yes bill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium tour where they are going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged\nThat like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly does never never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had and they believe the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\n\nThe lake a Donald Trump you know what this is why does it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in this part of Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it\nNever has happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up to get the kind of\nCrowds that they will not you may think rushed enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest\nFolks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you Hillary Clinton could withdraw flies do a book selling party she couldn't drop ... campaign appearance\nThat's why she didn't do very many of them\nIt would've been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons countries not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to

I. lazy\nYeah I just confirmed Jamal ... is a cousin of ... to show me and so they are unrelated\nHere is an example this is the Washington Post Trump joins Saudi Arabia's\n... cover up I'm telling you the the drive buys have been dying to tide Trump to this murder\nThink that they would love to undermine Trump's relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin ...\nAnd the and the Saudis in general and so with the Democrats it's it's just it's the latest in a never ending parade of events that the ... thinks they can use to destroy and get rid of Trump\nA shell game\nWas a friend of Osama bin Laden they went to high school together\nBut that's not that's not what you know about your show gave to show his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are or watch really relevant here\nAnd I think\nThey're trying to tell us that can show me was murdered by Mohammed bin Salman because ... was being critical of the regime and you just don't do that\nAnd well that's true I I think there's a lot more\nTo this then just he got killed because of the stuff he was writing in the Washington Post anyway\nUh it this is a Franken's whim Washington it's great to have you on the E R B networks are high\n... it's a very big requires you to do and I'm a general Native American and and I'm like this big or by the people I Hope that I'm strictly a third of white people tried to cash in on being native\nAmerica especially when they're living a big lie I can imagine that'd be frustrating\nUnder my drivers are joining the lowest standard of living in the western hemisphere rather than have you heard stopped Dakota so I Know what I'm Talking about it for a triple I Hope\nWell I'm a you know what I'm Wondering if this aspect of it I mean I'm here's Elizabeth Warren claiming that she is a member of this ah mistreated minority but what's she doing for all of this is trying to make her better as trying to make her look better trying to improve things for her she's not trying to parlay this into something\nFor her quote unquote Indian relatives and people that she hasn't mentioned a tribal connection at all\nWell because there isn't one and I mean that that she has mentioned the Cherokee because the high cheekbones which I think [noise] gee I mean millennia Trump has high cheekbones and nobody's going to say that she's Cherokee [noise]\nBut I think I think all of this is offending a lot of people she doesn't want to yourself to a tribe because that'd be the fastest way to have this blown out as non start\nWeekday afternoon to you on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W.

you know all aspects of guns and she has heard and her staff are all heard saying\nThings to the effect that she can't be honest about this and still get elected so she's\nNot telling her constituents in Missouri the truth on a number of issues including gun control she is much more anti\nSecond Amendment in truth than she admits to being now the fascinating thing about this is that\nThere aren't any news outlets in Missouri who are using this James O'Keefe project ferrets us video and so many Missouri citizens are not aware of it now I wouldn't go so far it's a media blackout but it's just it it's not going to approach being covered in the drive by media or mainstream press\nSo that's pretty much the sum total of it I think we've got some sound and the audio soundbite roster all of that coming up but back to the phones for now Suzanne Martin's ferry Ohio right to have you with us Hi\nThank you rash high up to catch me up this is not a moral question a political one [noise] and uh on

say try to report\nThey're trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the ... and the merger because Joe ... show he was wearing an apple bought\nHis fiance was outside in the family said Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan that she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom look it up she had instructions to call somebody didn't\nCome back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognized sort of get married her fiance that's waiting outside in the family sit down and she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and airy bought something could happen there reporting that here's ...\nWas recording everything that happened folks is not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does him that even if if we had a new watch the series for what she didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\nBut even if he did if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nLT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way he'll watch could have worked independently of his phone now there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch is just a giant red button you press it and it starts voice recording\nAnd it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concert was no way you know its its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches the phones twenty yards twenty five hours away from it I got a golf course when I lose\nThe range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards at most about what should be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like if there's no way his watch was recording at a thing and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be\nA recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under guilty they still need to be prepared to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording\nIt doesn't start at you can store I think up to a hundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch\nOr even on the phone it\nWell the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in the range and connected to the fun to watch what needs to be back into close proximity to the phone for his heart rate data\nJust show up on the phone it's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and and to remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than\nI Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the family said Dan\nWith the with the fiance now uh [noise]\nI've got the audio here of James okay if a secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign aide Rob Mills\nOut I this is this is important\nBecause this new is just not being reported in Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state of what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor news of the secret video from project maritime preserve Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nThere are times news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ medium Breitbart News in oak cure report but there's no way piece here\nWhy there is no New York times here there's no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat\nEven though they know publisher and fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here\nThere's no Saint Louis TV station matches I don't know about Kim Alexis St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now um there's nothing Yahoo News nothing\nNot one drive by Oregon mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google knows search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project verite sauce every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers at TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is his McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't openly said that says one of her age we got to\nSoundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project maritime us secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the in the project maritime ... secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nTightly here I mean I think we can actually win or getting in on our members are a young\n[laughter] Brian ...\nWere you able to hear that\nAre you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt okay All right let me let me read jury duty because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make\nSense of that or even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript\n\nShe said if we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son this guns stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he\nJust doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward because all those house members are total NRA folks the Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\n\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those they absolutely get rid of high capacity magazine or what what about for an outright ban oh well yeah and not right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way [noise] she'll say in fact\nThat she's very open to the idea of bump stocks yeah might have to get rid of everybody's on board with getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and\nBanning things more on on on the camps they\nMight lose votes in the Boot Hill but you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis if we can clean up the story I could I could lose some votes in the boot heel\nSo you people in the Boot Hill in Missouri and that's where my mom when my mom was born in Arkansas but she grew up in Kennett\nMissouri which is in the boot heel Missouri and\nI remember going there frequently as a kid there was one of those little towns down there I knew people in the booth we own the Boot Hill Missouri here on the e I'd be not every radio station worth its salt carries a perk and I'm telling you Claire McCaskill senator Missouri in St Louis ... votes if we can clean up in St Louis\nNow St Louis is majority Democrat a heavily minority populated and she basically saying if I can sweep up with the African American vote in St Louis I ever really clean up get big turnout there then I can stand to lose some of the votes of the Boot Hill\nSo you know in the Boot Hill a Missouri Claire McCaskill throwaways if she can just really clean up in St Louis here is a campaign ad for McCaskill or explaining\nThirty five thirty six degrees in Green Bay is not too early to be prepping for colder weather ahead [laughter] she wants to feel like temperature here right now is\nNinety five real temperature up there's eighty five but the humidity is Seventy percent all of this data by the way coming from I watch [noise] Ninety five degree field like temperature [noise]\nWe kinda get smog about that down there when you people are freezing up there we just smile [noise]\nBut then we have to put up with hurricanes now and then sometimes you know all evens out\n[noise] but I'll tell you some parts of the country Denver snow fall Sunday Morning rams playing the Broncos\nAnd it was snowing before the game that is in a flurry or two then a couple of inches of snow in Denver now Bolton branch flannel sheets may be just what those living in Colorado need this week or Green Bay\nWhen the temperature goes down demand for bowling branch flannel sheets goes up and quickly now these are the flannel edition of bowling branch luxury liners sheets everything Bowman branch makes is with luxury in mind and it all starts with pure organic cotton\nThat's unique to bowling branch it's why their products are so soft when they first arrive at your home and they get softer overtime now these flannel sheets\nThey're already in high demand they sold out in the weeks last year\nWhen we made mentioned so you you order them online at ... like everything offered by bowl and branch they're only available on line at our website that ensures that you'll get the thirty night guarantee with your purchase if you're not completely sold on the quality of luxury\nThat you're about to experience you can return them at the end of a

and you'll get fifty dollars off your first set of sheets\n[noise] and I think you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna be dazzled by the packaging and you're gonna considering giving these away as presents [noise] you don't want these\nSheets the flannel sheets and the standard sheets when cost you the same sheets\nAt a retail store would would be close to a thousand dollars he says the same sheets that four or five star hotel\nLuxury suite you use that you get these are two hundred and fifty and the reason is they sell directly to you and there's no middleman markup retail or an additional wholesale advertising promotion budgets and so they're able to sell the set of price points\nThat they consider to be much more reasonable that's why they'd be another reason for dealing on line as they want to have a personal relationship with every customers so it's bowling branch B O L L\nAnd branch dot coms we still have a a number of things that struck this caravan from Honduras and Trump's threat to withdraw all aid to Honduras doesn't grab that\nCaravan an order it or to return back home so you sit tight uh hanging there'll be a brief time outcome I look at this one of the thing I'm trying to remember what I've got here who probably two or three [laughter] I'll find it during the break here I Can't believe I covered just about everything\nHas to be some stuff\nAnd any today it's right after Russia it's all happening right here on TALK radio to Ninety eight point breathe in Fifteen ten W. L. A.\nAnd welcome back okay somebody asked me a good question about the watch the apple watch worn by ... [noise] Russia one about why fight a good question [noise] the way why fine on the apple watch works\nIs this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThe the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... connectivity is determined by your phone\nSo if your phone is using ... to connect or even the L. P. E. or sell get her to connect your watch is connected to it by Bluetooth\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on a wife I network the watch is capable of white five but only if the iPhone that it's paired June knows that wide network\nFor example when I'm at home uh\nI leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connects the wife ...\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe viable watch learns it but I still I have to manually enter\nThe wife fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the ah the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out there walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... got a wife ... what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I network on my watch\nWhat I doubt that\nYour mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate if it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife\nI network in there but if she doesn't know the password that phone is not going to connect to the Saudi wife I ended up the phone doesn't connect you with the watch will\nNot now if he had a history of going into that consulate with this phone and if one of the previous visit he had logged into their wife I network with a password\nThen his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered the wife I network password on his watch that's if the phone is not\nNearby I just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech ... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "16"}
