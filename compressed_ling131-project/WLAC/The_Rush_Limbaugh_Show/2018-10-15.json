I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important I'll watch it on our lives and that's why it's not this is not the most important election of our lives two thousand sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing if you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the elections um the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have an everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of the\nPolling data and says the media is so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trans is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't\nThem\nLike I say just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the\nBiggest landslide in a history of landslides and Democrat Party deserves to get by\n\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in in in a different world and in a sane society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean once ally and we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but I don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade tennis what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile found ... he always has some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in the only one and rather than just stupid country for so many years I Am willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like they don't then aside\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what\nOnce again we have here the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this is confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western socialists\nThey think still functioning at a\nDemocracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nThanks Michael this has been the ... stock market report with Michael O'Keefe truth and that's been officer for ...

[noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three ten Fifteen ten W LA's the\n\nGay minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort\nBy Lesley Stahl is ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair is six and one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is that just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis that TLC the reason for NATO and the reason for all these are lying to prevent more and more three no it's not true my frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with nano but\nThey have to pay their way I'm totally in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage\nWhat general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it\nFor doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less missiles trying to do here that's what they don't get they can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nThere isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every pot both parties politicians\nRunning around and we're going to middle class tax cut in the middle class pregnant burners through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore when it comes to income taxes\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThat top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone pain free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty little round that the fourteen hundred and fourteen hundred tax payers paid more\nThan the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent of the top\nOne thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the\nRich not decreasing it is not true to say they are not paying their fair share now this is\nAs it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce\nIncome tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people ended up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy at the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet\nWe never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change\nBecause if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they are getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to have so much more money than yours is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes that we're going to ... bottom somebody just go yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid that\nYou thought Donald Trump look like he was thinking racist thoughts listening to Kanye West last week\nThey repeat that Chris ... of CNN\nAfter playing video of Kanye West talking to Trump in the oval office said he didn't care what ... said he wanted to know what racist thoughts were going on in Trump's had\nMy curiosity wasn't about what came out of ... miles my wonder went to what's going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay other than a warm serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines and black clubs Trump these blacker than Obama ... sad\nWhat other kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the racist here\nThe son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not president even when he cannot pinpointed\nAnd my house in an educated guess Chris I'm uh I'm thinking that you're going to guess hearing it on ... west ... speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great this guy's blacker than Obama this guy's on my side this guy's going to do wonders for me\nHow does he know what's going on and\nTrump said they have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I\nThis is the kind of think it's I Know this is going to be widely known until I tell people about it\nBut I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him it befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie saw we were up here at number just as a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity\nOf consequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their parents\nHas the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painted and enforce hang on for launch that zero tolerance policy [noise]\nTear families with children and then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nThe parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into all kinds how are you gonna go back to\nIs less is Lesley from coming into our country illegally and part of\nMain part of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states my fault\nLeslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she says she misspoke there\nThis law on the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner\nThe reasons for it remember went down to two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWhat it was on the books but he didn't force what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books when Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforce it but Trump didn't make the law the Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just enacted one\nThat separate they don't run from their family to the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nYou asked me a question like about separation yeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about how I was making around your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you that you've seen in me much differently on the subject\nI agree but I don't want to have that\nFight with you know hey I'd like to highlight okay the nighttime I'm president and you're not in the mean\nTime I'm president and you're not reminding her and he is ... she is talking to you know\nA lot of really rude what do you say that he didn't have to say that she knows\nHis point was that he was not being given\nEven a modicum amount of respect similar to what other presidents have got yeah he's right about that these people despise him may still despise him and they're always going to simply because they can't get rid of him\nThey've thrown everything that they know\nThat Donald Trump they have tried every maneuver every strip the jury every tactic they have tried everything that has always work getting rid of Republicans\nThey have tried intimidation they've tried threats they've tried wise they've tried reporting a bunch of stuff that isn't true\nThey have tried intimidating voters they've done everything that has always made other Republicans back off or cave or sue for peace or what have you\nAnd Donald Trump does not respond to any of it\nAnd I love this challenging the way she asked him the questions in the way she is not following up on his answers the way she would with others\nWill take a break and your phone calls are coming up right after that smokes hang on [noise]\nBe and Fifteen ten W. I. lazy\nAs usual\nThank you for your patients we head back to the phones when we have to the phones and this is Scott\nIn Oklahoma City right to have you here Hi\nRushed good to talk to you know it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti bail them a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection holiday requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of press or you are versus oppressed this ... this this rule is is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany it against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is not only in about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nLet glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome to find a good host I remember that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out it comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a professor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or proliferated\nAt its later is now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how the press them how much of an approach where you are\nIt's called intersects finality because instead of just being one camp or the other gets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out all the foreign me\nGreat on washed you're you're talking or you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out on the action is basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist taboo this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation with that with militant Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those\nAnd they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify hurt cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore sees oppressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American his\n... just a matter of sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black uh well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks than okay All right\nI just want to mess up because that sub Saharan this is something what do you mean ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent than some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert\nOr which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I get your point a and\nHer reason for doing this all of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this\nBecause they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the\nIt was someone who it then you can consider cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical

Trump is working harder than any Republican at this moment to keep the Republicans in control of the house in the Senate\nIdea Trump doesn't get what's in the door if if if if this happens but specifically aside from all those things that they're going to aim at Trump the policy initiatives that have led to this great rebound and recovering economy is going to be brought to a screeching
