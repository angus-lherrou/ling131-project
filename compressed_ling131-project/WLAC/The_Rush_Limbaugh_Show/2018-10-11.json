I I I Do get concerned it there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed the futures of way too many women it has just distorted\nLife it's distorted gender differences and has distorted the concept of happiness\nVictim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world and it's and feminism is just one of many elements\nOf liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question where Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for ... same\nAll involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side ... so called conservative intelligentsia shock than Eric Holder was saying what he said you know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw in that\nWhen they go low meeting Republicans when they go low we kept them so people so my God he's out there inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally I was saying that we can't take it anymore we after

wouldn't get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them\nWe start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house it's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by\nUntil we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe responded to poll indicated the house races or over their poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they almost won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the Mueller report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it [laughter]\n'cause they can scratch their bags with it they just camp is eight and all that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's kind of tight Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at\nKanye West yeah Kanye West is what happens

narrative the top narratives hired a soap opera scripted the day seems today at one of the overriding concerns among the drive by is is the president's relationship with Rod Rosenstein\n\nThe debate today centers on whether or not Rosenstein was kidding or not in a meeting with other FBI officials when he suggested in wearing a wire the next time he wouldn't talk to the president\nWhat's compounding this or confusing people is that Trump has not fire Rosenstein in fact had Rosenstein up to the White House and then had him on air force one flew him around them got off the airplane with him\nSo they have a good working relationship the president still will not declassify documents that Devon known is in a number of other people want the classified which would answer a whole bunch of questions about the soft coup\nAnd who really started it and when and where and all of that and the president and I talked to Rosenstein and frankly told Fox News today in the morning on a phone I've I I don't understand\nWhy he won't tell people I had a great conversation when there are some things he told me that need to be under\nOath so the drivers are confused\nBecause Trump talked to Rosenstein Rosenstein told Trump everything you wanted to know Trump says I don't see anything wrong with it but then Rosenstein will go up and talk the congressman\nFrom making him do it so people can't figure out what's going on let me tell you how to\nObserve this or how to deal with trust the Trump knows what he's doing here that's all I can tell you don't fall for the fact that Rosenstein

up for it anyway you people are observing out there I\nGot another email rush could you explain to me this journalist named ... show gee it's ...\nAnd I'll be ... if if you [noise] I'll be glad if tell you what\nI Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name was ... that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he's related to add ... ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and they'll show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a\nA lifestyles of the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer adamant that the source of his wealth which is made to look like a jet setting party animal by Robin Leach\nSo whether whether ... related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... is a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince in Saudi Arabia his father is the kings king ...\nHe is the brother of the late deceased king king Abdullah their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many\nSons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying\nTheoretically to reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and ah oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know is winding dying the Google guys is winding dined Facebook guys spend a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax all kinds of\nCultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them open up being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past them last night I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite of Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton hotel\nIn Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding\nA certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do the corruption\nAnd connections in someone's he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your head\nYou don't get to run around a criticize the government and keep your knees for example ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the hearing supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nHudson Valley New York guy arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around election day because he's upset about the country's direction now who do you think this guy is going to vote for\nSkies obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find that this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring\nPeople to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise] right here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter\nWell I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters democratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... eight Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\n\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that they're ... but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay go the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week\nI saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so why was this is all they have the reason that they continue to read them online and saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan but it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is an old game we don't\nThe more and and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of a presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nHis administration who he does not like that going remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it [noise]\n[noise] during a live phone interview Thursday morning with facts and friends of president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington if he'd just trust the members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that to this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number Seventeen sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump\nCalling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some\nWe had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by it we had it on a great control\nDon't think really they go to very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people have lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it dead and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we check on him and the whole room Mr\nPresident started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics the better be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's going to discuss things safe for them to make a very dangerous stay put holder what is held in contempt by Congress\nOlder when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled\nThe IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to talk to like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge or or they would say\nWe strongest term oh we denounce rhetoric co authored by a attorney general holder written and it's about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemning\n[laughter] Trump's [laughter]\nHe'd better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I get you better be careful\nWhat he's wishing for now the stock market's been kind of the song it's been a roller coaster ring and Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just telling you something folks there are a number of wealthy Democrat\nWall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their businesses not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on nothing to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said and of course\nIt it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president is not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it double even look at our polling\nData people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's what I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or at four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter] I'm\nPaying interest at irate because of our head and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried\nWhen the economy's going great my whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so threatening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fender\nThey leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets if\nThese people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary Ford right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught\nIt's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed this limbo doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of\nTrump so Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react\nFive five one B.
