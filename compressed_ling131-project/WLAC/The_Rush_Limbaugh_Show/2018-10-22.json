Mm and this is why you say well that means it's doing the opposite no no global warming is at fault\nFor this population boom\nWhich which yeah is at fault for a chick boom because now they're saying there's tens of thousands of kicks and only on issues and the the global warming is at fault for that which which made it does it start killing most is in the future\nSo no way oh these extra ticket [laughter] are killing 'em [laughter] but we do it for fifty two eighty thousand yes but the ticks are going to kill them now what now and they said they found like Seventy\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds\nSo I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this and here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan were a Democrat idea designed to embarrass\nTrump that they would be covering it and building it up and\nWith people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet\nHappen down the road that CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known weather's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting there was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electorate hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump\nMaybe what they're hoping is the Trump actually won't do anything about it maybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're\nTalking about setting a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice the Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump doesn't like the narrative and didn't want it to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let the men\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got to show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what did you think that wouldn't\nDo the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters begin to\nI don't no doubt is the right word but they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get him if if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just\nSomebody has to be somebody has to be making this cap and hopes we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states since ... Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day justice\nCNN's outrage or what if something else ... by the way this is not a caravan folks this is this this is\nIt's an invasion ... is an invasion\nJust like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades I mean it's it's an invasion that has so foreign led to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the country and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them\nBut let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers\nOf this thing began to deny\nThe members food and water let's see if the people behind this creating a humanitarian crisis one week before they're ... rival [noise] oh my God\nLook what's happening it's in the middle of the Mexican desert and they've gotten out of water and there's no for my we've got to do something we need to do something\n\nThere is a hurricane coming that Mike oh well it's a perfect storm that could be\nComing to fruition here\nThis is the ultimate October surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this here's lonely Gohmert from Texas He was on today with Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the morning\nThe president made no bones about it and uh\nActually he can take his lead from the Democrats and Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents and Nineteen sixteen after bunch always gangs came across the border New Mexico and killed a bunch of people\nNot only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's aren't going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to be stopped\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the more you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to lower he'll talk about Jeff he's talking to Jeff and I won't even know who is who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions suggest such a big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points they already qualified for asylum in the first country\nFree country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country and if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this article left I think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprise as its eventual

Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill cameras says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent politic\nThe motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way they [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian state pumped pale raised the stakes last night has thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nDeployed out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nHow was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening especially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative\nAbout these invaders\nRight mind would want this who when their right\nMind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this un wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America what ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else\nSo Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals\nThemselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world it's so damn hard\nTo understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting\nAnd one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nAre being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense\nAnd because of some odd quirk that's happened in our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life\nAnd having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and say to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement\nTo the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do the Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an\nEntitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they tried to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't ... for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nRenting

was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer out\nWe're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say\nWhere you can use the military because a positive comments out is look that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border\nAnd make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you\nYou you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he\nCan't this isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks it's a joke you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in an invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio\nI was getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\n\nBe prepared for a major disappointment Washington Post with a similar story\nAnd there are similar stories on the on the midterms in the blue wave about how it's looking less and less likely and more and more toss up up for grabs as Republican strength is surging in places that it was not seen earlier\nAnd this is shocked and surprised that Dr ... and their polling catalysts that I'm here to tell you again the I don't believe this I don't believe this is the way\nThings have I mean it can you know for individual voter to individual voter but when you're talking about blocks of voters\nIt just doesn't make sense that the vast majority of people back in December we're we're all intending to get rid of every Republican they could cause they have a Trump made a mistake voted for Trump knew it and then nine months later changed their minds\nBut this is what they ask us to believe\nAnd that's why I Do this polling nine months out eight months out which doesn't mean anything\nOther than a you know interesting talking points at the time [noise]\nSo still lots to get to as the program an falls before you're very eyes and ears up back to the Caribbean story 'cause we're not quite through with this\n... the the the thing that that argues again for this being a Democrat Party operation or an operation intended to benefit the Democrat Party\nThe Associated Press has changed headlines about the caravan after a bunch of liberals complaining about an original headlined describing the illegal caravan as an army of migrants\nThat is the original a pie story on this that in range and a bunch of leftists so the a P yesterday changed the headline after a backlash\nFrom liberals furious at them for describing a caravan of illegal immigrants heading toward the U.S as an army of migrants a rat and getting\nGrowing army of migrants resumed march toward us read the original headline on a piece story a ragged growing army of migrants\n... changed the headline to replace the word army with caravan well that's not a caravan either it's a mob it is an invading army\nRight away not all of them are walking I mean you've seen the vehicles they're on a flatbed trucks there in pick up during the neighbor whoever is paid for this is paying a pretty penny\n\nI've seen estimates of seven thousand dollars a person for this but I was seven thousand dollars a person's eyes I say I've seen estimates I've seen estimates this this is costing upwards of twenty million dollars and I don't know about that\nBut I Know it's it's not cheap you have to feed\nSeven thousand people you have to provide fuel for those vehicles that are being used transport them now the cartels have that kind of money so the Democrat donors have that

do [noise]\nI've seen some stories they aren't going to do at the time because the pocketbook issues but making good money taxes are lower jobs so if you're part of a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start buying the storage\nEverybody this was going to be a blue wave landslide wipe out ever since last December you have made book on it you're running campaigns on it\nYear round the Kavanaugh operation based on it you're running this mob coming up here from central and South America on it\nAnd now all of a sudden two weeks out almost two weeks of the day\nWell well well we always know the election was going to be close so what happened with this blue wave what happened to it\nSeriously to Democrats have been out assuring everybody promising everybody everybody the Republican even scared to death how many Republicans you know how many Republicans have you seen on TV the past month acknowledge they're going to lose the house how many hits every one of them is it not with rare exceptions\nIt ticks me off I Can't hold back it ticks me off the number of Republicans I can give you a names if I wanted to oh yeah I got to lose the house the objective now is to make sure we hold the Senate\n\nHow long is it going to take how many how many cycles how many years is it going to take for our side to realize the media is jamming them every day the media is making it up the media and the pollsters and whoever else have an agenda and they're servicing it every day\nI Can't tell you the number of guys I've talked to [noise] [noise] oh yeah there's no way we hold\nThe house rush why why do you think well maybe the polling data why are you believing it\nI I've asked them point blank how many people want to run into who you know voted for Trump wish they had\nA nobody exactly my point how many people do you know\nWho voted for Trump claim that the Democrats need to win now because Trump has to be stopped and all this tweeting has to be stopped and all these bad manners have to be a nobody so why do you think the way I saw it on I mean I saw it on TV\nI see the polls why do you believe it\nWhere is the trend that Democrats are winning elections\nSeventy seven thousand people have signed up to get into the Trump rally in Texas for crews that whole Seventeen thousand people\nWhere do you get this idea Democrats\nAre probably go the ten is the salary for morning five ... on TALK radio da da ding than double the well a theme\n[noise]\nI'm Sorry it's not Seventy seven thousand is one hundred thousand people RSVP in for a chance to see the Trump cruise rally [noise]\nThe venue hold Seventeen or Eighteen thousand\nPeople are lining up twenty four hours in advance of folks a little common sense and this is Texas and remember to Dr ... told us that Beto O'Rourke\nWas the answer to me in spirited rock\nRib conservative Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke he's loving to by everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he raised in a court except there is a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in even the polling\nData and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real\nAnd yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke [noise] gonna be the guy and it can take God Ted Cruz has anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in that is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing\nLosing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies you know I don't oppose this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd that the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going into it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be\nThey sent me a video that they took their iPhone tennis max driving along the entire line in order to make the video fit to be in a size they could email to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note this is that this doesn't even show the people is exact getting through the parking lots to get in there was a\nMile long line of\nPeople to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies the media is not telling you how many people want to get in\nAre trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know\nNational media CNN MSNBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did\nIt would put the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these\nKinds of rallies these ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed the turtle and his wife are at a restaurant in Louisville\nKentucky and some mad cap asinine protesters shows up and just started shouting things will turn will just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything the other patrons in a restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today\nAnd they were talking about such A M the weight loss of loyalty and so forth\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave and I said\nDecent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side I Do whatever you want to call it lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture a seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can\nThat's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace for the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nYou think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have in March ... through Mexico mad walk out who they are those people were really and we're supposed to sympathize with if they don't show you the thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four\nHours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\nHow many of you by the

it comes to less lethal we just not something we do that well we're going to get your your sort of very good at it but\nThat wouldn't be enough okay what about this what about just the president here at the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're but you don't you and your ... your ears will let you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe'd have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down to squeal like a pig and then it's all ... we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\n[noise] but the president would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nBut I still got all these I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWild and what is it what's the proper ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound\nAnd since I don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross\nThere will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line and probably what Bush or talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got a hip than it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially storm the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they were met with the whole strike the more we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by half their story Trump Jerry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is still a lot of men nope\nNope half to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the ... the the legal lifestyle sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking this just\nYour own okay All right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it got to

you think Russia still get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe this folks these people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and they're irrational not only really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story ... all of the people showing up for Trump\nAnd that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out\nTo try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate and it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of samples last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the when an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love\nAnd compassion the guy is a full fledged leftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as the collective no that's communist wearing what she was talking about Florida as law or all collective\nHe hit\nIt would be a disaster for Florida right now is well liked anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do in racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters and ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be and the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants the government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness he doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism\nFor them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd\nYou didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson is running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott is one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful\nAnd as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a\nJust a static flat line just a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership and the Senate wants done\nWhether it's a benefit the Florida or not but the Santas would be great defense as as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump\nA but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing it and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have ah exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really was undeserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump\nTweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nAt transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states being caused there deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished\nWhatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed in any way I mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put\nBut one of these up on the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ...
