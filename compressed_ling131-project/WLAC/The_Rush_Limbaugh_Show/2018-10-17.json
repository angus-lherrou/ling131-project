... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about the show he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation in murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then one certainly said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I had to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that democracy show he's watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession of his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially tense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the consulate wife my network on his watch\nWhich I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know that watch will work on white five most\nPeople think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learned was a wife might not work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together\nBut only if you have answered that why fi networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I myself didn't learn you have to do this until a couple of years after I got my first walk I mean that's how obscure a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just\nBlew up you blow up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's most of the day they say to show he was recorded the events have have to record on watching baseball say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not\nPossible [noise] neither headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the\nDissipating blue wave including none other than the door yeah I'm\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and electric and bringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right\nSo see and I got rid of Fox willingly open an arm and a lady had done a Brazil won and hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to

until my chickens hatch\nShe said meaning there's\nSo much she left it couldn't happen we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact\nOf the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including Kevin ... although although\nIs even more survey data now that the Kavanaugh story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren folk honest thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunning shocked where is Bert rock\nGoing the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore if I Do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk of myself\nAnd what about the your tweets are so far these people say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that that's a way of getting the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nBut some of those but there are so much this information they put a [noise] that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour of [noise] I don't go to wait and collect social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest economy and the history of our country and it's not being reported\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not gonna stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated the CNN News media media whatever\nGuys they didn't do much talking residents there's just so much media there's too much gotta he's gotta stop promoting the country\nAnd so they're so frustrated they can't stop it [noise]\nBeck weekday morning today\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen than double the ... the [noise]\nMichael Jackson as a buffer rotation [noise]\nBlood on a dance floor [noise] what's the proper fall of obviously the league [noise]\nGreat to have you ever hear of telephone number eight hundred and ... to to have to look at this [noise]\nThis headline from Nuremberg knows Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro ... sources say\nDo they think that we are idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensify as the pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything if has got to be in tents everything has blown\nUp autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on I'm Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on 'em every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all along that mother is going to get the\nGoods on how Trump's Foley election by cheating including what the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver a key findings adult after the election you mentioned me anger and frustration [noise] not so much for the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but\nThey're there and look at a tick the rain psychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ball game for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump jaded with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nHalf driven the terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here include that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that week yet if it's got things in it that they like\nWhich the latter is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media rather than break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing\nThey're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped it up my mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment I got to be talking about before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this is what\nThey're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that is what they're hoping\nThey are hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here\nIs\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll referenced this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when\nMullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen\nTo one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end this\nBecause his report goes so Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude\nBeen the biggest Trump supporter out there for for when did your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven\nAnyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one reason is was because she's got to be so good for the country it is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for share and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically haven't overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why\n... is so high right now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because you said it before it was a record\n'em he said the Trump ... and he says the only reason she only way I can get my message out well his choice are good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not addressed the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the fresh prince ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm\nSixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well and that shocked you write\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of\nThem is very serious take them very seriously don't do the tabloid anything [laughter] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this\nDoes it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there\nObviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules that is the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something there miss treating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em\nOut and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism\nIs I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against\nThe little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs led if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about\nThat and it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy\nThe day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and the thing for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave really honest this is one\nOf the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most they pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just stuff there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor arranged\nThe cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word to file yet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in\nIn the editor says you don't run me you know control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you want to ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it live with it and the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures the editor says you did\nI mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor now\nI imagine real journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the ... story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not when recalls that got as peta I'll just get it up there and get it on the news ... whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and sell the paper didn't rotten I'm thinking\nSame level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there\nDuring all do a whole big voter registration drive out there the Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters is a DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it\nPossible that democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much excitement there are so much motivation there's so much as ... nothing can hold them back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried they're worried that something that's not a blue wave may be shaping up here that's what the headline\nIs that in certain they over a blue wave NBC News finds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen to current\nHelps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture of registration in front of those years whereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time well what\nThat's all you need to get them if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's\nThat seems like a little hope will we don't have a full database numbers for to do so they say well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration with Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration\n'cause there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake\nThen they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull trying to help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headline will the blue\nWave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat may give them a card all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats is saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man and now she's warning the Democrats\nTo stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masks back on your Democrats have got to read camouflage yourselves she's warning the Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda\nOf course we should fight massage witty and racism whether or not it's politically expedient these are important but the country faces lots of important moral questions Democrats can't answer them without first getting into\nPower she's saying nice to have a shot up stopped your your your everything's backfiring until you Democrats shut\nGolf Sean and we have to you on TALK radio not he ate point three and ...\nOh\n\nMy welcome back okay back to the phones we go I I'm I'm not making the point is blue ... there's a lot of\nLike here is that to see NBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories in a row here plus ... Brazil about\nThis now I don't want to make too much of it but that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing back for Strategic\nReasons and still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able\nTo discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades metal bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but\nWe'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first camped in Mississippi and a damning nice to have you welcome to the ... network\nThank you Mr lumbar I appreciate it this is definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhen I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nSo I had a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the midterms\nNot not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh I don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the fight the Democrats' chances and no boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise]\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worse\nThere is in in the\nIn the quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections mean call me even five at this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it out I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact opposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this\nIt may even be a written the regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman late procedure that the the O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales justice third wind the department of justice does nothing including indictments\nThat would impact and election now the Hillary\nCases that I had to exonerate heard their futures dependent on it\nTheir careers depended on it and she was the Democratic nominee they're not going to be in the business of charging and pursuing indicting the Democratic nominee again citing the unwritten regulations not impacting the elections so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in smaller report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know I ended up what could happen\nSince they've decided to leave that Mueller is about finished\nSince they've decided to delete that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to [noise] not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally ... ... ... ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or\nLittle Brian ... Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not\nAbout you play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to ...\nIt's not up the Mahler\nIt's gonna be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\nWell re work and so forth to make it look like\nWe're about to fall off a club or at least that this recovery is just hit a wall\n[noise] um [noise] I don't know how effective it would be um but I don't I wouldn't\nI wouldn't sit here and unilaterally suggest to you that it\nCouldn't it couldn't happen a\nAnd particularly the areas you mentioned they would love to be able to discredit Trump's tax cuts they would love to be able to uh to discredit a whole bunch of like the tariffs and what it's doing to trade the problem is\nReality the reality on the ground if the if if if the if the numbers are a ring\nTo that extent it just isn't\nGonna jibe with reality and it's it it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises\nThey've tried October surprise in October they've tried them in September\nThey've thrown everything they've got at Trump including during the campaign the Access Hollywood video and that didn't work now he's out they're calling the porn star who by the way\nIs a back stabbing black mailing\nDouble crossing porn star is that they're calling a horse race\nAnd there are shutters and the drive by maybe su Didi of\nOh my God [laughter] presidents doesn't next you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called paragon virtue on the left where wandering perversion has become normal in their world\nAnd they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like [noise] all women\nAustin but we're not talking to a woman we're talking about a dual at ... at what porn star double crossing\nBack stabbing\nWoman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call her name she is a woman who attempted to him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on people talk\nThis way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply looked at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they're they're comedy has become literally\nHate and then they act like one of the greatest social ... question your history of humanity has occurred what Donald Trump uses the term horse\nFace when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ...\nFeet in the truth about her allegations I just I just find it to just a little bit hollow as low take your pick take ... take your pick any left wing or on media griping about\nTrump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter never talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try\nAll day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters like she sent it back that there's so much good going on here and focus on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut you do there are also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder of the uh\nOf the journalists is in the Saudi constantly is some bull\nA dramatic a shaggy they're still working on that but I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works and now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to print it yep just cleared the transom here\nUh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better at much higher than anybody on the left and the media wants to at MIT\nAnd while you were W.

four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump did was remind everybody this or actually inform them because the drive buys had not\nAnd that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny that were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports\nOver and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply\nReminded everybody in real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford van is she has no evidence there was nothing to support\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well it just sort of that one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point and Kevin all came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again the\nStory was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum months the drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform when I'm appalled she was slithering around that Dr ... they're making a hero out of her\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did and then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles for rule out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again you're ... the prostitute porn star is paying Trump\nWho among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it\nIgnoring that the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse space in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump\nIs embarrassing I guess they were stopped talking about people that way it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original take or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says lounge in very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible very compelling shake Tony surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she does know wherever there's a lot about by the\nTrump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit ... throwing the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not reporting of being Trump win and remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin Trump campaign finance violations and all that [noise]\nSo you can say you may not like the methodology but it ends up working as an email\nFriend of mine said this is ingenious at work\n[noise] trust Trump\nYou mean so but he thinks it calling her horse race was genius somebody\n[noise] in an email that I have here let's see what the Democrats tried this headline this is\nFrom the hill dot com Democrats damp down hopes for climate change agenda what\nWhat does this say Democrats are on the likely to pursue major climate change legislation even if they win the house majority despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the issue\nIs represents a shift in strip the jury for when the house Democrats last controlled the chamber in two thousand nine maybe they're not going to pursue it even if they win the house majority they're not going to pursue it's\nA wonder\nWhy could it be that in the span of forty years we've now have the force ten year warning\nAt least the fourth warning we only have ten years and in the midst of these forty years we've also had reports that we're beyond the point of no return that there really is nothing we can if\nThey've tried everything now they're even saying that climate change is going to destroy beer and there's nothing we can do you know why\nIs climate change going to ruin barley it's gonna ruin the ability to harvest and grow barely barely won the primary ingredients and beer [noise]\nBad news for judge Kevin alright\nInvestors business daily Trump's approval rating is better than you think some pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader plus year Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more\n... low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you was it was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nCrumble a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive buys are fully aware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is\nA much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nHe's not out there that's going soft he's not it was you know don't got me on this during his presidency he did not like campaigning for house races it was so nice the office of the president's eating his mind\nMusic isn't about fashion fun so fresh and see how you can get started is I Want to play music dot com\nTime saver traffic just a few minutes away on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen vast W LA scene [noise]\nMeeting and surpassing I mean going way beyond audience expectations everyday [noise] your guiding lights on Rush Limbaugh a household name and all four corners of the world\nWhere people do indeed let's\nGo back to the phones to Long Island Michael great to have you sir Hi\nHi how are you sure sure\nAh growing up in New York City life long Democrat told Obama's first term between his corruption and just in that and I started to walk away and act actually helped me out a deli\nReading a transcript of your show coming home on the railroad everyday turned me into a conservative so thank you\nWow I [laughter] I'm flattered thank you\nUm basically just wanted to say to everybody out there that are very important unfortunately I never turned it it is just horrible and I compliment you for keeping up you know keeping people focused\nMake sure as we get through the next three weeks that they are focused in and voting Republican and voting conservative because\nThe alternative is just going to be totally ridiculous ... decade\nI Am I Am still in the in the process of preparing to alternative what would it be like today if Hillary had one and what will it be like after Democrats respect the house I think that's the best way to go about\nThis rather than just bugs and go to vote river to go out there and let me ask you a question about that I'm sure you're you're you're on this program this program is is a\nTailor and it it has the audience have has do you really think the people in this audience or so soon the Fox News' audience do you think they really need to be reminded to go out and vote\nUnfortunately I think some do because um October surprises maybe Trump will do some sort of treat as you mentioned earlier that might be\nLacking you know tone or judgment and some people the Kenyan that might change from last minute ah but you know the vast majority obviously are going to vote Republican\nBut you know just keep it out there just to keep reminding them of what the alternative is it somehow they decide they're on the fence all of a sudden\n[noise] well I you know I Try not to do much differently as when predators be consistent uh all the time of year round and so forth um\nI kind of ... when I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I I like to assume that's why I ask you I like to assume that the audience of this program\nIs fully aware and up just like you are I think your typical of people in this audience there you're here because you're concerned you here because you're educated informed and involved and investing in an outcome\nI most of the people in this in this audience are exceptions obviously so I I I worry that it's somehow talking down to people to\nNot remember you're talking about their vote you know you don't want the Democrats run into how people already know that otherwise I'm looking for\nDifferent ways to accomplish the same motivation\nHappening right here on TALK Radio's Ninety eight point three Fifteen and several you lazy [noise] places and I have a question I continue to get emails about the [noise]\nSo called Washington Post journalist or Jamal karaoke [noise] my\nQuestion is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas it been confirmed as something happen since this program but has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed not confirmed so they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music while they did all of this\nAnd of course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they were going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recordings ... knew what was in store for a method\nFor NATO's apple watching a recording of this stuff and the somehow his iPhone that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I Would have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do\n\nAll of this concern and remember Hillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about\nHow in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in bend gossipy\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see a a disparity here in proportion\nNow of course we all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for his CNN all afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable\nEthics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nBears subterfuge is the people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had to hold two doors did you know that\nDr balls the Ford had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nIt had to do a Google employees readings\n\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot place yet to front door is ... ... ...\n\nI've ever Google employees going back and they had her own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than needing at four claustrophobia and PATS knee like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years [noise] well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe in the side now how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was his name was fairly expensive\nAnd then simply have home security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make they use ... folks to\nConnect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I certainly wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nLast complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting why fi connections\nTakes a little bit more work\nThey use white flour and they use computer chips in their sensors in an detectors in the ... cameras that come with every system send signals doors and windows are open and if you are armed or simply say system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e\nSomebody tried to break in or are there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish your will have an intimate knowledge and awareness", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city":
