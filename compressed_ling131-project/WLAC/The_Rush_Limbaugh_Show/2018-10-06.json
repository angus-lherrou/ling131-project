{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Well when you quit working that's no longer the situation so now your daily uh I guess your daily activities your daily habits are now changing as well that's a little bit of a hurdle for some\nOf that is for sure I mean every everything is changing in I think you know we've we've kind of created a scene here the today show or talking a little bit about procrastination as well so\nYou know it's we procrastinate on some of these ideas of ah you know what are we going to retire we're never going to you know what's gonna happen emotionally him I said I'm not going to be going to the same place what am I going to do with my time I'm\nIn is the fear of the unknowns so I I just want to stress that procrastination again is going to be a killer so don't procrastinate it's never too young to start looking at\nAnd asking some of these questions and sitting down with someone and saying OK what am I going to do after I retire what's it going to look like or how am I going to spend my time or what or how much income do I need\nAll great questions but don't kick the can down the street and\nYou know you and you and I were talking just a second ago you know off the air but and then you had a great story share with all the odds are as a great outcome 'cause I did not know that you had\nStaged for melanoma on your on your back until we were talking about it and that's that is a great correlation to procrastination so I'm going to see you up for a few seconds and say hey tell tell everybody\nWhat had there might be some good inside for people and their ... of a malignant melanoma and I didn't I stood in the doorway it at my job talking with people in offices and I would scratch my back\nOn the doorway and this this thing was right in the middle of my back and it was you know melanoma typically are looked like a mold and they start changing shapes and so when you have something on your body that's changing shapes and then another aspect of that is they typically itch\nSo well that's why should the doorway and try back for two years while I finally I go in and the only thing missing is getting bigger and bigger I think I probably need to do something so I finally did but it's like two years later see it because you know are just you ... center in my back\nCould not see it because it was just a feeling we're back to them or right right just the feeling okay and so I go to the doctor and um I mean there was this a crazy story at the end of the day but basically I go in and the doctor that I sit down with is\nYou know you you can understand doctors that deal with cancer I mean I cannot I Can't imagine the emotional and the stress that they go through all the time because a lot of times it's not a great story\nAnd so the guy that I'm sitting down with us going okay well we can do chemo we can do radiation I go I thought a melanoma you just kind of cut it out and hope you got it\nYeah well we're certainly going to cut it out but we need to start thinking about some of the treatment process\nAnd I'm like OK let's guys really stressed and the next time I come back with a different doctor\nAnd he goes yeah he's on he's taking a leave of absence he just you know he's trying to do everything he could to make people live\nBasically and he just distressed we've got overwhelming\nAnd the guy that I sat down with it was like man I'm really excited to see you because you're really in good health and you know you sit in the waiting room of a cancer office and New York man people are really have a tough and I'm thinking man I got it made well then the positive was they did cut it out it was a stage for and I got lucky 'cause it grew out not n word\nIf it had grown in states for would not have been a very good situation because\nMelanoma those are really bad obviously and so the so I have a buddy of mine that came and he said he knew I'd had a malignant melanoma\nAnd he goes I got a thing on my ankle and when it's kind of changing it it's just a little bit I go just go to the doctor they'll cut it out no big deal don't wait don't across in a trailer that's forgot about the morals of the story and so he did he went in they cut it out and it turns out it was it was a malignant melanoma but they caught it so fast that they never gone anywhere\nThat's the challenge with melanoma is when you let 'em wait they start traveling other places and that's one ad scenarios happened\nAnd so you know the the moral of the story it would be if you have something that's a mole or something that starts changing shapes and it just go to the doctor it's no big deal\nFor them just to chop it out yeah and so I got really lucky I mean there's no question about it I mean this was twelve Thirteen fourteen years ago and I wouldn't have made it two years probably if it it actually grown in as opposed to out\nYeah well thank goodness you went and thanks good you know you took the step said\nNow I did to wait a while to take that\nWait a while and then and it worked out here I mean that the wedding\nAnd I've now been able to give people advice on hey don't\nNow and I'm going to correlate that because now it is a positive story but I wanted you to share that just because there\nAre other people that are going through the same thing I mean we all have different stuff and we got to take that step so whether we're talking about retirement are going to the doctor\nYou know they all kind of come into play as a ... when we talk about creating a great retirement we you know we always talk about your health and we talk about your money and we talk about what you're going to do with your time in your life and your love\nAnd so don't procrastinate at any of them you know take that step in and\nDo you get the cancer cut out or figure out the answer for retirement or let's look at what's your income number isn't all these things are a again things that we shouldn't kicked down the street for sure so\nI'm going to mention one thing to mark that uh you know we're looking to work with a hundred people and I've got fifty eight folks right now that I work at fifty eight families it I'm trying to get two hundred once they get to a hundred\nAnd not taking any more clients so I'd rather go deep with a hundred people than scratch the surface with thousands of people and that that's important to be so I Want to impact people's lives in a positive way [noise]\nSo if we decided to go to the next step again because it's it's something we're both gonna feel each other out and see if it makes sense the next step is for us to to really begin to\nLook at where are your assets how much are you paying fees what kind of risk are you taking out of these compare to what the goals you're trying to achieve then we also look at health care we look at income needs we look at the all of the investments\nAnd he's making sure that as many people as possible are made aware of this it had to kill the Washington Post to write about this headline Canada agrees to join trade accord with us in may call sending new NAFTA deal to Congress\n\nSo we're renegotiating NAFTA Canada Canada which said they want to know part of it they ask in the last moment hey don't forget that can we be finding this to prompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorists jumpstart hell no it doesn't mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap\nTariffs not remember\nHow to drive ... and the Democrats than the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods\nWasn't gonna provoke much icons it couldn't possibly being good at it might mean the end of whatever Rangel are making what the North Korea and it might destroy existing good relations with the child comes\nUp up breaking news China just cut import tariffs on wide range of products China\nBut ... will cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the ... finance ministry yesterday\nAttract I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with those some of its biggest trading partner such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one I thought it was necessary to do\nAnd it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our on our jobs even more than that throughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour\n... maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended the statement\nOnly recently started taking questions to tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are\nClueless a known to understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know we're the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take and in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies and Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy that doesn't mean that may cause we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important in how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about any kind of run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as a noun Singh\nIs fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with\nUs [noise] [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and\nBut both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nSteel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets disapproval\nIt's for them to do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody it's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come in now and I as I say it's folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize we really we\nReally haven't as you know you can see evidence scientists on our own culture of the achieved any accomplished somehow feel the need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it as some\nSort of new definition of humility a rather than having used as a teachable moment there's something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want every country putting our country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for\nEverybody to do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nA don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget it was ... Hussein oh who said none of this could be done\nThe remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially [noise] we're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore\nNow just the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of unfair trade issues so\nThere you have it it's um it's not a sexy subject NAFTA never was I mean it was in command that a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified in the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject of cable news announcer gonna do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people\nTune in it's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden of the day that people get it is important in terms of it's important that says that election issue it's crucial\nIt is um I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it can be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion ... in the subject of World Trade don't doubt me and in that sense it's a confidence inspiring\nFood complete organic Hi I'm natural passing Dr

[noise]\nThe drive buys wanted to talk to Trump about Kavanaugh and he he decided to go there and he just visceral rated Richard Blumenthal\nAnd Cory Booker and Dianne Feinstein and basically told the media that as far as he's concerned they are the Democrat Party to\nHe talked about Blumenthal lying for years about having served in Vietnam when he had never even been to that country served with valor as a marine said this guy a serial wire on his resume is questioning Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd he went on and talk about Cory Booker who was admitted to fondling women in an herb that by the way that was an attempt to cleanse\nHimself to show that he has reformed when he did it when I Need killers Feinstein ... accused her of leaking that Christine ... for the letter he did this Saturday Night at West Virginia and it was hilarious\nThe way he thinks he knows that Dianne Feinstein leaked I don't have time to explain it I might have to show for those you watching on the dental cam I'll do my best to show you what Trump did he imitating Feinstein when the whole question of leaking came up and he's now they're asking if it's\nProven that chemical was drunk and high school does that mean you're taught nomination and Trump was talking to them about that\nWe'll get going here hang on [noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review Hi welcome back Rush Limbaugh and the ... someone's in broadcasting network great to have you ever hear of a number of your calls in due course aim I've written to wait two to eight eight\nTo [noise] so the president continues to take questions and the rose garden from Dr by me I Would jump it but the things I Want to get to hear a and I can just as easily relate what the president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying trickster present skunks that they are\nHe is linking the media to the Democrat Party\nWhich uh we do with all the time here but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct and Bobby as\nHe has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and find that at one of them was Feinstein\nIf you'll recall toward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how the world did Christine ... letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it was we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington Post\nShe called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\n\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a visit you most a nose ring or\nIs it fair ... button light and\nIt became obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of the letter one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and said a German restaurant I ... I Need to react I Need to respond to this out ... re just allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just ask my staff I just asked my staff if any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't her what she said because it's off Mike\nBut she's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you look at the you'd look at ... she turns it back to the camera we need to make it\nThis is a German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say oh is this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and ask to undergo his seven FBI background check\nHis accuser has no collaboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein guess turn around and ask her staff hey did any of you leak this letter in a phone nor nor was it was the last she turns back around so we we didn't do it unless you're German\nAs though case closed it wasn't us they had to have done it\nIt was strategic just like what happened on friday was statistic strategic\nLadies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript of a conference\nCall that have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't\nReproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally habit but I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democrat front groups that organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it makes it\nCrystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake that he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator incident where it just happens that\nTo nearly in say an anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activists ended up there in flakes elevator with a CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting then they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to death\nIt was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was never ... there was a three point strategies a flight strategy was number three if the other two had bombed out\nAnd they made it they pulled it off they did it\nJohn Fund has a piece today at National Review who was behind the flakes set up\nAcorns tactics live on and the senators elevator confrontation with activists from a George Soros backed group on friday morning two women raced past reporters and security officers and block

happening\nI thank you for taking my call you bet um I I think about since the beginning of this year several times you mentioned that as an incident or an occurrence has yet to happen that will affect or seriously affect the term\nI was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is that incident\nWell could be I mean but but the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we get a poll in June or a polling mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the polling July it's with thousands sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything 'cause it's not when the election is and I said the the the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in July\nAugust September\nA and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this\nOh dear this is going to get resolved one way or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout it's going to affect votes\nIf the Democrats lose this ah if Kavanaugh gets confirmed\nA than\nWhat a democratic voters going to do they get us going to be really enraged didn't show up and vote are they going to be mad depressed and sit home who knows but this thing is going to get rid of if this if this is not resolved before the election and it's a defeat anyway because all the Democrats want to hear is delayed delayed delay\nMy only point was that those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to the election nobody can predict\nThat are going to have a great impact on it this is one of those

Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage of the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nLet me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know one time he gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have and will fund we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that\nNobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that said wages on who was going to win\n\nSo the players made their bets and that'll ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that check stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bets\nHalf the final turned ballot check stops the tape a horse race again asks the players if they want to make conditional bats or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you were doing you were making bets you've earned guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is\nFinish you never know before it's over\nWho's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it was a motivational\nAnd he designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time or third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here posing January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media\nWhich is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh news so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the cabinet of lay out\nNow all of a sudden house races are tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate but wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final inning take over\n[noise] well\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't want anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here one thing and did you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral production\nOf last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine went viral and Dr buys loved it\nThey love it when the leader of the G O P reminds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting an all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite he's just the exact\nOpposite why all this attention on Capitol on what the Republicans is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will fire buddy up no the way you can get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news at ... some of this from the hill dot com ran state Democrats face nightmare scenario on Kevin out\n\nThis article shows beyond a doubt the Democrats are brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations\nAnnounce camel you realize the latest defense in New York Times has run the story saying that Brett Kavanaugh through ice on a ... bar patron back in his days if you ate\nHe threw ice this\nGoes to show just how on fit for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is of course the New York times when learning that Bill Clinton's old Juanita Broderick put a little lights on your lips ... while walking out of the room after allegedly raping her hey thought that was not worthy of being published are\nPrinted that wasn't enough to that I mean put some ice on that live there nah that no news there but Kavanaugh throwing ice allegedly a buyer pays for stop the presses the guy is evil he is not qualified\nSo all these unfounded sexual allegations they hope\nUltimately what all this has been about hoping to force Kevin ought to drop out that's what they have\nJust like the mother investigation Mueller investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers on the Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support in Washington\nBy Republicans have they can get his approval numbers now that the twenties because they succeeded make everybody think of Trump cheat in with the Russians and Trump would lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there is no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the mother investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with it what they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign from\nThe nomination withdraw or to force Trump to withdraw that and the way they still hope that they can force Kevin ... out a second\nDemocrat is from the article here to heal dot com a second Democrat Senator said there's widespread disbelief in the caucus if Kavanaugh is holding on\nHold I just had a conversation with a colleague who said they couldn't believe he hasn't dropped out and yeah that's

but that vote is now here in confirmation is expected by a narrow margin it has been a day of high emotion here at the U.S Capitol protesters and those for and against Kavanaugh making their voices heard Senate leaders now making their closing arguments\nMoments before this vote let's listen to the closing argument now of democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nWhere he was nominated for the judge Kavanaugh was a very flawed choice [noise] but once President Trump's elected him Republicans decided they had to rushing through they became a steam roller\nOver truth fairness and our traditions of bipartisan cooperation any means necessary\nTo reach their desire to and they blame Dr Ford and Democrats\nFor judge Kavanaugh's flaws [noise] they were intent on shrouding the truth because they knew that if the truth came to light\nJudge Kavanaugh would be exposed as a truly flawed\nNominee [noise] so\nMy colleagues\nFellow Americans what is the appropriate response\nOur country needs to have a reckoning on these issues and there is only one remedy change must come\nFrom where change in America always begin\nBox so to Americans there's so many millions\nOr outraged by what happened here

rights native populations vote [noise] if you believe that the Supreme Court should be a check\nOn an overreaching president vote if you believe the process here in the Senate was a sham and you believe Americans\nIs there a better vote\nIf you believe that Supreme Court justices should conform to the highest standards of character impartiality temperament and above all honesty and credibility\nVote\nI understand I share the deep anguish and millions of Americans are experiencing today but I said to you\nMy fellow Americans there is one answer\nVote high yield before\nThe Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer the top Democrat in the U.S Senate making his closing argument before this vote\nConceding what we expect the outcome to be the judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to

voting will begin all one hundred senators or at least Ninety nine who are here are expected to be at their desk to vote when their name is ... that will happen alphabetically Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell now giving his full remarks\nThought for posterity [noise]\nThose are the words of Henry Clay\nFound your score that their decision United States senators will\nThe very survival of our constitutional form of government\nRequires an expert\nJudiciary [noise]\nAnd impartial court of justice\nIs Alexander Hamilton put it\nIn the federalist papers\nAll the reservations a particular rights or privileges\nThe courts guard our rights\nAnd the Senate guards\nThat Mr President is why today\nIs such an important day\nThat is why the vote we take this afternoon\nA vote to confirm a new associate justice of the Supreme Court\nOf the United states represents one of the most consequential\nDecisions senator ever makes\nThe members of this body\nOr duty bound to ensure we confirmed justices of the Supreme Court who are men and women\nOf the highest character\nAnd the most the pilot of\nThat is just a sort of nominate\nStands before us\nToday ... weeks ago\nThe president nominated the jurors\nThere's been described by legal pairs of all political stripes\nAs a superstar a serious scholar\nAnd who is legendary forest preparation\nAnd possesses the qualifications to

judge Kavanaugh\nTalk about his work ethic\nIs on lynching honest advice\nAt is fundamental humility\nFor twelve weeks the Senate has saying that this is not\nWe've seen the legendary preparation\nOf a ...\nWe've seen the patience of a committed mentor and teacher\nWere saying the humility of a true intellectual who led his record\nEach of us and saying this for ourselves\nEvery senator who came into this process with an open mind has saying that\nVery same Brett Kavanaugh\nWe've had his brilliance is paying checking thorough and it's all display and the three hundred plus opinions\nHe issued on the DC circuit\nFor twelve years yards Kevin all excelled on the bench that many experts say is the second most important in court\nWe're saying is genealogy and kindness first had and our private meetings with an nominate\nPrecisely the college all approach that are so necessary\nWe've spent his professional excellence says we reviewed more pages of documents pertaining to judge Kavanaugh's career\nFor any other Supreme Court nomination in our history\nPages that depicted meticulous\nWe have now started the results of seven\nFBI background investigations\nInquiries that are produced no evidence whatsoever to corroborate any prior misconduct\nBut rather are consistent with all we know about this nominees starling character physicist starkly tall mountain of evidence\nAdds up to one clear message\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh was among the very best our nation has to offer\nAnd the country proud\nHe will serve with distinction on our highest court he unquestionably deserves confirmation\nAnd the country deserves such a Supreme Court justice found after president as I'm explaining the stakes are always high\nWhereas Supreme Court confirmation is concerned\nThey are in session that is happening right now we expected a some protest obviously we've seen the scenes that laid out outside the capital all day long and there are police I'm a security personnel right outside the windows of the galleries\nUm in order to remove these these protesters are as a\nAs they make their voices heard ms Murkowski Lisa Murkowski voting will want to hear this\nMurphy and things you just voted present I gave a lot of the parliamentary um signal nation\nThat we expected but again the idea of Lisa Murkowski pairing her vote all was that she would um uh allow your deference to her colleague\nUm city mayor Republican from from a Montana who has been a strong supporter of of the confirmation of a ... [noise] Mr rash\nVote tally now stands at third round the thirty five it will take a simple majority for confirmation of bread around [noise] which are Rubio [noise]\nI'm not sure John decker if you've heard the interview with Mitch McConnell on a Fox News channel a little bit before the Senate but he suggested that he and the president had talked an awful lot after that second hearing and never wavered\nOn on their ... um supportive of Brett Kavanaugh I'm no talk between him and the president he set of of pulling the nomination I assume that's pretty consistent with your reporting with how the White House has handled this show very unique nomination nominee\nWell that's right the White House digging in its heals over Brett Kavanaugh over the course of the past if you got even\nA one at times over the course of the past few will his nomination was in doubt I was outside during a for the president's departure when that interview was played on Fox News channel but you may know\nThat Senator McConnell gave an interview as well to the Washington Post I read that interview and in that interview he again reiterated that at no time were you doubt that they would stick with Brett Kavanaugh as their nominee van\nHollen [noise] ah Chris Van Hollen of Maryland a casting his votes is Warren [noise] what's up as Warren of Massachusetts the White House arrest these are no votes um we're waiting for for the wicker\nNumber here to to reach a majority simple ... with Ninety nine senators voting as we expect with her youngest the Kavanaugh sitting at forty nine right now [noise]\nThe vice president presiding over the United States Senate\n[noise]\nAnd that should be my vote from Montana\nAnd your name again in ... it's more dire gambling al ... [noise]\nHe where president ... [noise] he would have voted I\nI had voted no hair will not change the outcome I developed I guess for withdrawn they thought\nThe senator has that right [noise]\n\nSenators voting in the affirmative\nAlexander ... so ... through the tally you had heard the explanation fire from Raleigh Murkowski or a Republican from Alaska explaining\nThat are ... Republican ... from Montana where president he would have voted yet\nAnd already granted opposed\nThey would vote no but you allow Hitler or his vote count is high without him being here because it does not count as he is voting present and made that announcement and you heard the virus in and say the Senate or has that right that is something that does not happen very often in the United States Senate marine used to be a traditional it's more frequently than it is\nA recently called carrying\nA ... vote I Believe the last time it happened was we were fourteen and it is a ... when you have it or sometimes at the same party some time to different parties that are on two different in the wake of the vote and\nFor one reason or another Senate or can't be there and and they find a partner to to pair with two are not change the outcome\nIn any meaningful way and that is what we just saw him as you made the earlier point John um it is a sense of of comedy a sense of unity that is the explanation that land Murkowski gave last night when explained that she was going to do this threat Ryan\nAt least bit by bit or store um some of the the the ... nature of the United states and hasn't really been tested over the last few weeks of his nomination\nGillibrand well keep in mind that leads you'll nature maybe back to where it needs to be on the Republican side I don't think it is certainly there between the parties are because of what has happened over the past few weeks it's going to take our time\nA Senator Flake is an open about that he wants to do something or\nTo move in that process board of every ringing I guess you could call it a more Schumer a camaraderie uh within the Senate certainly it's not at the place where senator has lake who spoke about this on the Senate floor and also during one of the Judiciary Committee hearing white how it has to be a that something it's going to take\nAs I said you're a quite some time especially when you consider the mid term elections upon us for weeks I Believe from today and so the partisanship it's only going to increase in the weeks to come\nAs it stands right now with no senators change their vote we believe that vote tally is fifty to forty eight fifty yes votes to forty eight no votes that would come from\nOnce this vote is official Brett Kavanaugh is an associate justice Sunday United States Supreme Court senator Danes Republican from Montana not voting is he attends his daughter's wedding Senator Murkowski explaining\nHer reason for voting present because of Danes apps and so they are still working through the vote tallies making everything official um before this vote is called but as we expected\nOr the votes appear to be there for Brett Kavanaugh that upcoming associate justice on the United States Supreme court but John there's a little bit of formality of a little bit of paperwork a few other things that have to be done before a Brett Kavanaugh will be addressed as Mr justice right\nWell that's right he of course still needs to take the oath he needs to get sworn in White House indicating that could happen as early as this Monday of that that is a federal holiday so perhaps wearing a Tuesday when he's sworn in and of course you know this already Jared the Supreme Court\nA session this term the Supreme Court has already begun began the first Monday in October this past Monday so a ... soon to be called justice Kevin all will have missed much when he finally takes his place as the ninth justice on the U.S Supreme Court\nProbably will be able to catch up and it's too old so I think that Supreme Court justices have to take not just one there you are\nCorrect that is correct and so uh we'll see a public oath that uh\nUh Brett Kavanaugh will take that will likely be here at the White House if they follow the same form and function that we saw with Neil Gorsuch last year when he took his place and of course it was a big ceremony and the rose garden here at the White House when that took place I Would imagine we'll see the same thing take place for Brett Kavanaugh\nIt looks like or many of the Republican senators have started to walk around shaking hands I see Bob Corker the retiring senator from Tennessee shaking hands with majority leader\nMitch McConnell who is um had a pretty broad smile for most of the day is you can imagine getting this confirmation through it has not been the easiest road we're waiting for that vote total to be announced by the vice president who's presiding over the Senate Mike Pence\nLooks like he's got the gamble in hand which usually is indicative of an announcement about to be made by the presiding officer [noise]\nUm other senators now now moving about as well as this vote is about to become official fifty yes votes forty eight votes confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court [noise]\nAnd we continue to wait sometimes there is a little bit of of um formality and procedure that takes place with the Senate votes particularly on these are very important ones you want to make sure every senator has just been counted\nThings been counted the correct way before you you drop that gamble but this was an outcome that was expected after those procedural votes yesterday in the announcement that came following from a senators are Collins and mansion and\nFlake um the loan or a Republican no votes are coming from Lisa Murkowski who is changing her vote to president Mr Khan difference do senator dance [noise]\nDistrict Carper no\nSounds like they are working their way through it was a senators are beginning to leave the floor so that would be an indication John that\nUh they believe their their work here is finished um regardless of of the outcome that they favor or oppose\nUm it has been interesting to watch Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Senator or the one Republican opposed to Kavanaugh are sitting at her desk watching all of this continuing to speak with colleagues are shaking hands with it looks like a West Virginia a Republican Shelley Moore capital or\nHow she got to her position of yes uh yesterday on the Senate floor\nDebate it's complicated furthered by the fact that the Senate confirmation ...\nBut they're finally getting nano legal print that you press\nThe print them send in and and they earn that guilt there on my thinking and I cannot stand in that [noise]\n\nThat was Maine Republican Susan Collins talking about the sexual misconduct allegations that have been leveled against Brett Kavanaugh he has a very defiantly a defended his name and said that those are unequivocally not true uh brought out a second hearing\nA in front of the Judiciary Committee with him and uh a woman who made that accusation Christine Blasey Ford 'em and ultimately you heard that a bad thing a big impact on on the ultimate decision of of\nOf ah the Susan Collins the a Republican from Maine now one of the other undecided up until yesterday was another a moderate Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski or the one Republican who ended up uh stating a negative position on confirmation and here's her explanation\nI Believe they have a nice man [noise]\nGood men [noise]\nClearly a learning channel [noise]\nMy conscience [noise]\n[laughter] well I have to sell the gay with my conscience [noise]\nI could not concluded that he is the same person for the course of time\n[noise]\nThat was the nation of Alaska's\nLisa Murkowski and again the one Republican who would have voted no she ended up changing that both the president to appear at which the Danes to Montana Republican\nWho wasn't here but the outcome remains the same Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the United States Supreme court by a vote of fifty to forty eight is one of the narrowest votes ever for a Supreme Court nominee though we expected that to be the case that vote interrupted at times from\nProtest a shouting from the gallery but\nAh at the end of the day that Brett Kavanaugh will join this United States Supreme Court or you want to talk about close divisions in the United States Senate we've seen in recent opinions John ... a pretty closely divided Supreme Court as well but a dead or soon to be justice Kevin ... will become a member of\nWell that's right over the course of the past few years we've seen quite a few five to four decisions by the U.S Supreme Court a largely breaking down along ideological lines of the swing vote over the course of the past\nI Would say almost two decades has been Justice Kennedy who's a place on the court of justice soon to be justice capital of will take the place of and uh it's bought that Kavanaugh will be a more solid conservative vote and so perhaps we will see\nThat swing vote emerge\nA said during his tenure on the Supreme Court which could be for the next few decades given how young he is\nAnd we talked about this during the confirmation process uh justices are difficult to predict sometimes you don't always know exactly how they will rule on on issues that we may not even be able to imagine a a pure before them\nWell that's right now just just a soon to be justice a cabin on now judge Kavanaugh he sits on the U.S circuit court of appeals for the DC circuit or he was asked quite a bit during his confirmation\nProcess how he would vote on numerous controversial items that may come up before the Supreme Court he refrain from answering those questions but he'll certainly be tested a and it will be interesting to watch his first year on the Supreme Court he will be confirmed is of course as early as this Monday\nBrett Kavanaugh confirmed that the United States Supreme court by a fifty to forty eight votes in the United States Senate a second nominee for President Trump on the highest court in Atlanta for John decker I'm Jared ... the U.S Capitol is Fox News radio [noise]\nWhat people how to beat them we have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use that he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about like ... before he pulled out of the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nA ... thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it and will do the right to own is on record as being open about that later on when he's learned what he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really

verbalize you've you've heard over the years liberalism mental diseases are all kinds of ... and I thought that that that's too simplistic and besides it's not effective I mean even if it's true it's not going to be effective say that\nBut that doesn't\nErase the fact that we're dealing with some genuine in comprehensible\nEmotional problems on the part of these people and I have to give credit where credit's due it was a little blurb by Jim guarantee at National Review that caused the explosion of brain some apps is in the frontal lobe beer he said\nI'm paraphrasing going to have a right in front of me but he said I don't even think this is what I I think psychological disorders people the psychological disorders have become\nLiberals and politics at the ... that that psychological disorders people who have them have brought their disorders into politics and rather than just a singular thing had happened to them they make it all about the country did it to them or an entire population did it to them\nThat's exactly what liberalism and has become and that's where we agree [noise]\nListening to Russia's week in review readings are welcome back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network books here is the is the James we've done the gym and guarantee quotes from a National Review\nUm the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them onto the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nAdmitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution\nOr The Revenge is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this um [noise] ... well the me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement to look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here\nAnd it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is\nSimply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black convict is in is in every instance here points\nTo the country at large as being responsible in on fairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise] the\nDemocrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage and the anger never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders the White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary",
