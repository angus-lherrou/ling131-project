guy with a van it\nDoes look like she is a a a disturbed individual a lot of ah Donald Trump stuff on his van but you know let's wait for information\nYou know we we there were people who said uh on the right false flags they were those on the left that said it was a conservative um we've said the whole time let's wake for information might be a crazy guy\nAnd might be at those amazing to just say I'm a lot of people will make a prediction with no evidence on something like this right they'll say oh it was a right wing or or it was a left where and then when it turns out to be one of those two\nThey claimed victory as if what they did was was a good idea you know it wasn't that bad a good idea you know the fact that you come out and you say are you blame the right with no evidence and then it turns out to be someone on the right that doesn't make you we're we're process good right let's see\nI'd sorry I should I I just [laughter]\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something sent to me here said that he was um I'm from ... and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party\nBirthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two ah income information pending what is this site can't tell what the site is it it's um [noise] anyway identifies\nIt as a member of the Green Party [noise] uh yes he's got pictures of Trump and he's a GOP stickers all over\nThe of the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if\nAny more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients today all saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico\nVirginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them of\nBlow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to them is still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this one everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they like trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber because it creates first impressions\nIt it's created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is this is this is the uh the narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions\nAre what are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we have the GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth\nIs it didn't come into the at the British and three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also do does alphabet and Amazon half reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the drive laws are reporting that day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on\nThe horizon and then there is this from the media light\nHeadlined Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I bought a left wing media narrative that had been created but apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today complained about\nWhich means the Russians would have been it's just\nThe way people think amazes me it always does\nPutting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall today and let's get started\nThey call me deal ended tendencies report back Monday morning at five on TALK radio and I made forty three Fifteen to an elderly lady an identifiable website that doesn't find this guy is the Green Party being ripped to shreds [laughter] [noise] um\nNow be because the stickers all over ... stylish white van the a drive by media are concluding that he has a right winger\nHe's a right winger and he is a Trump loving a deranged individual\nNow according to Florida voting records he has a registered Republican full names ...\nAnd his party affiliation as of march for two thousand sixteen was Republican Party\nAnd he's a been active as a registered Republican since March fourth of two thousand sixteen\nUm and as his voter status is um is also active now that information is from heavy dot condo claim they got it\nFrom the Florida voters search site which they might have done but they would have had to know his birthday to get it um we don't know his birthday is so we can't double check the claim here so this this stuff\nJust happened to happen right as the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things\nThey want me to repeat a now say Iraq is a Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American I and again I'm One of his own here with the with the information for you that as as I receive it [noise]\nUm [noise] and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that's what's making first impressions\nAgain I Can't emphasize that uh [noise] enough\nNow the drive by having the stop their coverage\nAnd have joined the President Trump areas\nIn fact I listen to it a little bit of ourselves he's got a big powwow headed up there ...\nFor the media thank you very much I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement who had the best in the world and they just showed and thank you very much\nLeaders of the White House [noise]\nNow to the subject at hand [laughter]\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are greedy and courageous married yet again proud of them are\nMuch about it is because he's not getting on to the ... the the real meaning the reason for the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way up state leadership committee\nOf hundreds of young black leaders are in America that her gathering at the White House and met a lot of ... about this\nI guess the president made and acknowledgement to law enforcement for their great work and tracking down the bomber and bringing that story to a to a conclusion\nAnd we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I'll say I want to grab the phones get started there it's open line friday and I know you want to weigh in on this\nAh so are we going to start a just as if we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them okay Jimmy and Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and Omaha great to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I was gonna say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical towards the media and the radical left in this country\nThat I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay\nBut this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about\nHow you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr flu wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there's no red but I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\nAnd I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up but if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think this package bombs are means of disrupt in these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state they are going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats in the middle of the state thing not\nGoing to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is of Democrats in the deep state loses they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation\nDesigned to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts hearing hates the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated you think that\nThe brake feeling president how your brain and actually improve memory is an ingredient originally in ... in clinical trials can sound can improve short term memory\nCriminal can help you brain better life

I'm OK I'm OK I did not fall you know these new watches have fall detectors not meaning if you fall if the watched detect that you have fallen it will offer to call emergency services for you\nIf you're incapacitated all you have to do is do nothing if you do nothing after a certain number of seconds passed it'll\nCall yeah that's the whole nine one one where you are it also gives you the opportunity to do not I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice the show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild Jess ... my expression field manner of speaking as drinking might watch triggering my watch into thinking that I Am fall and then I Can't get up\nGet starts vibrating no you know what this is a great health featured that a lot of people are buying this watch for grandma and grandpa because it does it work they've ... they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors\nAnd stunt men and women and it works but it's also it shows it nothing wrong with is comes back with false positives\nBut I'm my my hands on even hit the table at ... just wildly just sticky waiting around to her in my fall alert has been triggered him to watch that's what [noise] just interrupt me but my my point is it this guy\nHere has been screaming notice me and how here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this man [noise]\nCNN sucks [noise] here we go\nThat image than on top of course the president in Iraq that he's not technically of responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the chat than I'm south at his rallies [noise] but ...\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for ten years\nLooks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you can have political discourse\nBut when you've crossed the line it is extremely dangerous and that has what has been giant mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs\nAnd you know in a\nIn a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets and they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger\nThat at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except the theory is crackpot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempt in violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way CNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure the people's the inter find people that are that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless lay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our\nIssues they have lied about them is dated them is characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nAn actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing\nOf hands over what's happening to our politics because the\nShooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter subway chalk it up where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody comes down to Trump\nHow a lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make a ... I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply ... and I'm Talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people\nThat want to sit here in the high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves whereas they said Donald Trump is trip perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted\nTo decorate in dress up a van that says noticed may and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over the top [noise] this is what you would do\nSo\nMy two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference a young black leaders from all over the country this has not\nBeen done before in in this in this manner\n[noise] uh [noise] and he's talking about the rats in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[laughter]\nJob by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these\nTerrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country now I wanted one can remind\nYou of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not\nAs ... pointed ... baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... forge showed up\nAt the ... at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she continues to testify I think if what happened or happened in Kevin are maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it gets himself on record just being proper in the proper way to look at it\nMinutes [noise] making a wrong turn into gridlock shouldn't be one of them time saver traffic\nOn TALK radio Ninety eight point three on the ... the [noise]\nA couple of observations about those two audio somebody's replayed Donald Trump in the White House today was like three hundred and fifty four hundred\nYoung black leaders from various walks of life in the United states did you hear what happened when the president of the United states praise law enforcement\nSome during applause\nStanding ovation in some parts of the room with some during applause nobody's looking at me and there nobody started booming law enforcement's among this group of young conservative black leaders something else\nIn in the remarks made by President Trump he was very gracious tort law enforcement\nHe was very gracious turn the work done to bring this ... mile\nDistance gusting make America great again bomber\nTo justice\nAnd I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators and the drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing for two reasons one\nThey're going to consider him a total fraud that he's calling for unity\nYou might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there's going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox\nIn a call trumpet total front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos in division\nThey will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit\nThey'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it remember the old Limbaugh the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portraying himself as involved in any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um that's the ... the around the Obama effect not response that's we're going to get accused Trump\nBack in the second is important which so he's painless as you said you can't train so improved and I discovered salon pasta ... plus this topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing has worked better for salon ... plus cream or wrong [noise]\nEmail phishing attacks cost businesses billions winery and real cash beta law and brain damage fishing ... are hard to get popped because they're not going to appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees\nInto Glenn Beck weekday mornings today on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen than double the ... the [noise]\nI'm just to clarify the Limbaugh fear of them was how I explained that the media never held Obama accountable for anything that was going wrong including his own Hama an Obama would never even always position himself as an outsider\nAre up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I will I marveled at this and how how the relationship to the bottom of the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable I mean all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing\nNever called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's a ... law enforcement\nAnd they're going to call him a total fraud here by trying to say he's free unity when he's that guy and they're going to say is responsible for\nIt is not is man and they'll say than he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about this as if he's not complicit in it\nThat he's trying to stand above it they gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to it mark my words [noise] okay for those of you watching on the digital camera here is a shot that has three windows filled with stickers what in their ...\nAnd his band as is the case with all of these they will eventually be at Rush Limbaugh dot com so everybody can see them no I couldn't withhold um and have them only for digital camera usage but that that would be cheap ah and and I'm necessarily\n[noise] we're just taking advantage here of the tech\nOr being able to use the switch or to show you these things have you looking at big van window there on the left\nA you will see in the right moment in lower center you will see when you may not be able to tell I don't know what size screen you're looking but it's Hillary Clinton in the crosshairs of a rifle scope\nAnd just beneath her as you're looking at this to the left is Michael Moore also in the crosshairs of a shotgun\nAnd then to stickers over from Michael Moore is the CNN sucks\nSticker or whatever but the thing to notice they're three total windows in the van there's no way anybody could see in or out\nOf these windows these are in the rear by the way\nThey're on the side of the van\nA you've got parents or the upper left look how evenly proportion every sticker is look at nothing is off line there isn't any overlap\nNothing has been slapped up there in a passion or anger or any of that in either of the three windows that you'll see here\nNo no nothing is said that this is South Florida sun this guy's been driving around who knows how long nothing's faded this screams notice me this this would be the face you got a bunch of people down in South for\nI don't like Trump they see this man park somewhere and you know if there's somebody would be throwing things on it are scraping it with the kids or gay paintbrush and tomatoes rotten eggs who knows whatever this damaged pristine\nVan is a is almost like hey a work of art here is Chris in Las Vegas glad you wait until you're next year on open line friday high\nIt's there it's an honor and privilege\nAppreciate that serve thank you\nI just wanted to say about the only thing this guy's van was actually meant the worst spotlights in a giant neon sign that said I did it around [laughter]\nBut [laughter] [laughter] I mean I Can't speak out any more than it already has\nIt's ridiculous\nYeah what this guy's apparently by the law enforcement radar for a while\nUh they're claiming DNA got some DNA off I guess some of the packages here he's been arrested and and uh on law enforcement radar but you wonder how long this vans been decorated like this how long it's been driving around down there unnoticed are observed or or what have you\nIt does it just I don't know something about this that [noise] I don't know I'm not sure we're watching a hundred percent\nRight so you're a hundred percent right like it looks too good it's been out there in the sun for as long as it has been people matched it openly can despise the president and probably have a long time\nAnd nothing's happened to this guy then it's like somebody just toss this guy the keys and tell them hang out for twenty minutes the cops will be here you know and then you just take it from there it's like\nHow much more to set up in this book like this then even if this guy who was part of the Republican Party the guy needs help and he doesn't represent anything but a small fraction of some extreme it's not hold a candle to what this party actually is your\nTrue very true goes up saying but I mean you you got me imagining pictures now is van driving around and you see people would notice of and I noticed a bumper sticker on a car in front of me if I think it's loaded\nJones is is this man [noise] ah\nThere's no way that this man doesn't get noticed in doesn't have people reacting to it in in certain ways so you think what then you you you you think this guy is being used\nYou know I don't know like I mean like it's not there is going to a gym we lose ... and the guy is just off his rocker and he just needed medical help on on a hobby [laughter] Russia I mean\nWell you don't

says he\nThe sense was that the momentum was being lost\nBy Republicans Republican voters the story was that Republican voters were [noise]\n[noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what [noise] early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump is drawing that parade President Trump\nToday complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting in at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens\nAnd the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this was another example of Trump pacing just like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowered the boom on her at a rally pointing out\nThat she really had no evidence and no way to back up what she was alleging\nSo some people think that he's some during the same thing here uh basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we\nDid great anyway and there's some people think that this was very very artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this\n\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome looked at the obstacles that we that we came through\nAnd we try out\nSo we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked

free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes a big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but that hurts point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the ... a bit of an upset [noise]\nThere's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this\nIt is yes your ego barely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half so statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month\nTo put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum now there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ...

buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails and tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new wells advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power from developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll\nSee how that plays out there is a Politico story today I saw it last night that Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThat Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win everything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort\nIn Florida to try to save the day here it is a political star and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drugs has links to them that are the socialists of America\nAppear ready to win and dominate and convert America after long\nLast too committed socialist policies so you find these stories all over the place [noise] about the intention of voters this ah this cycle\nAnd how they're faring the Charlie Cook report the vaunted inside the beltway analysts who take a look at every election inside out\nWith the election just eleven days away now it seems that the overall Senate playing field won't change much although it appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even tighter that says it's getting more difficult to see a path\nTo the majority for Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp\nHeading for defeat in North Dakota Democrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority the one way would be the whole the five Democrats seats and toss up and pick up three of the four Republican seats and toss up\nIf you will read the book report I'm not going to bother telling you which ones those are but that's how they analyze the bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has been moved to toss up\nIn the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it\nNew Jersey being in in a toss up\nAnd Florida remains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he's the incumbent he would have in the path\nTo victory in Montana between Jon Tester\nThe incumbent state auditor Matt Rosendale that racist tightened tester maintains an advantage that's either just within or just outside the margin of error\nThere is an addition to the top

what is said at the upcoming press conference of the media are eagerly anticipating and its upcoming they're seated at the department of justice waiting for whoever's gonna conduct\nIs to\nExplain how they found a guy who the guy is if they've found anybody else working with the guy\nOr their co conspirators are there a conflict is is there somebody that has been working on this guy for some period of time inspiring motivating revenue him up I mean there's so much that we don't know yet\nAnd we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is\nDespite all of that there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what\nHas been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanning spies and the Trump campaign lying to the president about whether he's a target or not\nLiterally trying to set up Trump employees\nAnd so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia\nRussia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still ongoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with smaller just briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the\nTrump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was hounding proper or your advisors who is obviously goes out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea he George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador is stepping options you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation go get the ... orange what's all bogus\nThat was not when the investigation started it started way before that my point is how much the deep state wants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea\nThese people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in at the un I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole two years ... who they are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out\nAnd the fastest way to making sure that nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get the ... the the Senate and the White House back\nAnd then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened these people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared\nThat's another reason why Hillary had to win and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up for the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion with on well\nIf I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it\nI Will those people are capable of anything to get what they want I have no doubt about it and I'm Sorry it's not my fault for being
