this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president what would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd

would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\n[noise] now I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be in until somebody in the Democratic party cried this\nTrump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acting on concerned on interest in and would always say\nA variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just ... rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nNot doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't withdraw flies there her book signing ceremony\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums but\nSeriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly that would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanted to get in\nBut it sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in numbers we haven't seen and who knows how access Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd I've been wondering what if what if all of\nThis is just a bunch of ... media and and and pulling unit manufactured just like it was in two thousand sixteen\nThey were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen they got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump's forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here and a Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor of California is is closer than is running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't seen the meltdown\nThat is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach Kavanaugh and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nVery quickly on TALK radio and how do you have point

house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning and the Democrats column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to the polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you and me and for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority salt\nTo resign seats firmly or leaning Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is [noise] and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other\nThat to nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this gusts with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nHas a people in this country have been poised to send\nTrump packing ever since election night two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed there just got for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true\nWhat has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that it's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what\nWas I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're asking will be or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and\nThe FDU cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or an eye on them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watched and said well that's it\nFor the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informed is smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load
