before we go to the break we're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears her in just a bit to talk about the caravan\n'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to CNN and I caught the governor of Ohio there\nJohn Case it and he is being\nInterviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN not matter they interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would ... those who are legitimately in need of asylum can be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nYou know if you don't do what we want we will rape your dog will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go I Phil Donahue used to do this all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's what difference it made for me it if they started at stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on\nThere that was to watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of\nProsperity and defend the is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't they were the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others we don't have the right to impose our views on\nPeople but somehow we ought to stay on the

were talking last night and we came up with some really good common sense points you make that kind of illustrate why we think these packages weren't actually mail\nUm it hits their concept questions and the first one to me is how likely is it how could mail multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd haven't shown what miraculously at the same time and if I really yeah and if a if I leave the vaccine that that's not that's not common sense I mean I see how that\nCould work that way just sick of the De Niro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the day before truth CNN got there's Clinton so forth\nI there was a ... film Griffith and that they have like four or five of them shows up all of that same thought well how do you know it was a priority mail\nYeah it it could be banned I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller his you what I was going to one of the Congress else can they can factors there wasn't enough postage on if you post office he even accept it\nUm yeah the thing is these these were these were oversized packages so you're not taking and paying for this you know having them weight and paid in profits properly\nUm your you'd have to stick the post office box I don't even have enough wind whipping oversized package\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that but some of them actually show up at the residents so\nYou're going to think that\nSmoking what what are you suggesting that what are you suggesting hampered\n... I got pregnant I'm Sorry I just I mean you know workers are trained to look for the trees are you looking packages cheesy if you're a joke I mean it looks like a joke even if I could see that there's something in there\nAnd if you look at the very draft you don't you think that after going through it\nNow wait a minute see this I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought this up I I wouldn't know I haven't been\nTrained I don't work the post office so I haven't been trained but I I've looked at these things and knowing after the fact that they're that they're what they are yeah they look odd but if I worked in the postal distribution senator stuff was going through that or I might notice the postage incorrect\nAnd so forth but that one does strike me as a bomb in their [noise]\nDeliver on our agenda\nAs a state senator I wasn't afraid to reach across the aisle pass bills helping veterans teachers law enforcement farmers and taxpayers\nMy sponsored legislation eliminating the hauling tile led the fight for Tennessee teachers by passing the teacher's bill of rights\nWas cited as the most pro veteran legislator in Tennessee by keeping promises to our veterans sacrifice everything to protect our freedom\nIn Congress I'll continue those fights and I'll stand with President Trump to build\nOn Hannity weekday afternoon you on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten ...\nNo no I'm just saying folks that if I worked in a post office and how many how many packages and pieces of mail go through the region every day I don't know how long they look any baggage but there was nothing that would have told me that there's a bomb in there now maybe\nPostal workers are trained that if things are of the shape and size and so forth I'm sure there's some of that kind of training that there might be about something had to ... people in\nA so the fact that there was odd and US Airways some of these were delivered like today it got to the CNN mail room or even though John Brennan doesn't work at MSNBC and had his ... maybe I don't even think it had to write the and an address I don't think I don't\nWear the CNN ... device was sent was not where CNN actually is [noise]\nIt was quote was but it was it was not\nA dead center location near rose package was found at four o'clock this morning\nIn yesterday's mail a so De Niro package made it through the postal distribution center and ended up at his restaurant ... did open a George Soros thing some of these people claim that these are hand delivered or or not delivered but but\nLeft Under Cover of darkness that they didn't go through the mail all I'm saying is uh the previous caller these things are so obviously fake the postage does that work in the address is ... ... can all be true\nBut\nThere has to be all kinds of pieces of mail every day with misspellings incorrect ZIP codes odd ball postage odd ball I mean people write things on the outside of ... all the time you get your Santa Claus mail\n'em all I'm saying is that I wouldn't be able to spot that those packages contain bombs or explosive devices and every time the stuff happens I always wonder how those things are identified\nBefore they're open isn't that what we've been told here these things were spotted for what they are before they were open in some cases here is Steven\nKennedy ...

scientific mind when essentially all his project was was a timer\nA a clock sometime\nI have an email here I got the call her out of the blue and I don't have email I have to get it during the break\nUm the email asking me about clock boy he was fourteen years old and it it was it became a costs to let the kid was supposedly well beyond this year is brilliant brilliant brilliant engineering mind and when everybody finally got to look at what he had done it was just a timer\nAnd it like the kind of time or that would be attached to some kind of a ... my memory was explosive device not his project was not a bomb or an explosive device but it it turned out to be not nearly as technologically advanced as its height\nRight Obama I knew the Obama and Biden clock boy to the White House\nAnd made a big deal a out of his achievements and uh and so forth so the patient will will for the obvious question is if that guy could have perpetrated if a fourteen year old kid could have perpetrated a scam and his parents were in on it too\nHe got invitations to go to MIT and ah and other schools and really the the device he put together was was not my memory is it was not advanced of all it
