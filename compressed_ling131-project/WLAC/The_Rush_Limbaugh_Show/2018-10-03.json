investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously\nThat's how this happened what does it matter once in the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs they ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right\nThis is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the\nElection you want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there ... mocking balls the forty wasn't mocking or what\nI understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine Blasey Ford there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right even if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart [noise]\nSpecially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her whether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing\nHer allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did Trump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's only did\nRepublican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step and it\nIt might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big take away from me as this one year the New York times has been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax\nStory on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word\nWhat one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\n\nRussia a tendon forward that they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody and MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did was make up the line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else\nActually are what are some companies are seeing mostly allergy how\nA bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in the audience that don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all of John's\nHey you're not that I watch it I don't know when you got to be able to print it by like what you're going to come up I guess what you're not going to you're going to come up by women like New Hampshire aren't great but it's not a\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this so not only do they live in denial that it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up\nYou know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester with confronted a a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kavanaugh protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges Cassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody\nSo why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor do harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by on\n... would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protestors protestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCash that you know no would you like and uncorroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor oh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\nCassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and I would make sure women heard clearly euro care for rapist those on the Supreme Court Cathy and I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing to you protest no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this\nAnd help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media [noise] you know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went\nInto early interviews I found out that's not an all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them

doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country\nAnd accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nKristin ball the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that if if she's telling the truth my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's the vents play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them we have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than voting to the rights oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique if they trumped developed I don't even know if\nHe developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans have Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've grown out of the fact that he has ... continue to prosper and try and buy cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump has been attacked\nSo much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nIn Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\n\nHe just simply pushy she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any crop ration for what she said why you're not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine\nCan you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush or a million women or nor do their surge we'd be\nWell yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed a made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this\nEven the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nThe Trump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why she's needed\nIn Lebanon he sent a flower off road over into Lebanon area causing

your ear is the is the James is on the gym and guarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics and all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for bad description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that\nThat are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this ... ... well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you can even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated\nSomebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate [noise] I'd stick\nIt in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been\nConstructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incidents have happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in on fairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of\nThese complaints\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage and the anger never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nAnd here it is that there's this they've been even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was a flight out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the birds he shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski and it may in fact in the way they bowed means or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony [laughter] and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be followed five to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said has been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right you can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ...\nTo do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately somebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rush straight to speak to you again a right to have your back\nYeah it can be out again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nOr come an old guy raped me the guy did this did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you're like a couple of months ago saying that a guy he raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nGet away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies that Michigan\nIt taught women in her class at all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman\nAnd she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made literally believe\nThat men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um ah you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free when it's their idea then everything's\nFine hooked on it if not better I by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly includes women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK

J. people that were doing this\n\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I'd look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh\nTo withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it now that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his\nNominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego was such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's just many screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after\nThe Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened to ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators when women out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these free Heitkamp Donnelly my cat was actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would cave and that Murkowski when cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay\nIn their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven polling has been gun\nHeading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski but if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today power line Scott John sudden one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates the varying dates the different dates of the sword did invent Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression and the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden\nChange within a few weeks after July sixth of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists as they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh salt\nThe charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged\nIncidents in the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties the when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid\nEighties\nIn her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties in the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high schools summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she sent it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes are current as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes in her convenience first Ford's tests\nMolly the assaults occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that presidents should alert or your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people
