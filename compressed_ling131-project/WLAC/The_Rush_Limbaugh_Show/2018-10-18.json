L. A. the [noise]\nBack with that do Jaffe [laughter] you got some news about a an unfortunate\nIs a morning I mean we're we're to discuss a little bit about the mourning process yesterday on showing without legit Fisher my pockets are Dennis Hoff a passed away those ...\nWho's Dennis Hoffman the the ... of Nevada the positive out of\nAll a result loves there at one there was only ... the ... the love ranch I mean all of the most famous ... H. B. O. cat how series on all done is better for twelve seasons but am I right at how\nOn HBO what well yeah he was ... there was a [noise] there's a ... so there's a show on oil based on on the yes rich dealings when ...\nNobody is trying to stop and it's up to four thousand people now it's estimated that this is costing somebody Twenty one million dollars these people\nHave to be fed the they have to be transported me and they have to use the bathroom they have to be\nAble to drink water and whatever else they can get their hands somebody is making this happen somebody thinks that this is going to watch or girl well for Democrats\nWere told that George Soros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the camera pan is the children as it always is there are children in the caravan and that\nIt's kind of like the baby unborn science I always hated those I even had one major baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else's inside this guy actually had one of those made than those bother you baby ...\nRush maybe on ... we had a rush maybe on board little inside the needle a yellow sign we made it up and it was available at the Rush Limbaugh store\nBut this is the same thing children young children also we must do what we must\nOpen the gates we must stand beside we must allow them passage\nSo we've got this we have the\nMueller report as I say more on that in a moment the ... report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio sound but I have coming up uh uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd ... former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it helped Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating was Trump not letting them in either there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this\nKind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected Donald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion image of growing\nSo obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick I saw them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or to separate the children from the adults\nSo that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written ... that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in McCann where these people will say they're shocked that came to America to save their lives were their children and to improve their latest they won't let them is unlike anything they ever heard about the cuts of pictures of Trump\nSmiling as people are denied entry the Democrats\nThink this\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically this'll be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on either side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way\nOr am I missing something somehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt to making patently obvious what it is because you're not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be fleeing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated it's planned this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nA lot not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the mother report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations in this instance I'm we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of tropical to go to Russia so if Mars ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the statistically finely sounds I hear [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and when I look at this [noise] yeah well take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is number ... audio soundbite number tens and this is\nThis is deep state ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room he's a\nCounterterrorism center specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will\nFrom other going over Rosen high let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only this is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the ... I really want to see what's in that narrative report\nOkay so this\nIs where this is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff\nTrump is none none of which is probably going to be invaluable none of which is going to be impeachable although if the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt but it's not the indictments\nWhich\nThere's nothing for unless they make it up there never has\nBeen any Trump collusion and never has been the evidence or less they make it up\n[noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being so in over his head that it looked like the Russian\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration law\nConservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nFully funds President Trump's border\nCase a lot of people lives in Brooklyn\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nThe leadership of President Trump [noise]\nSo how President Trump\nFor the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy bill football and enforce the law\nFor by the Tea Party express [noise]\nFor not bound by law ... see what's going to need some cash\nFast no matter what your credit score is just go to Linda genius\nWith only a husky ... ... ... and ...\nBenjamin Franklin captured lightning in a bottle over two hundred and sixty years later with a little resource\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy\nEnsuring Americans have the energy they need whenever the\nDot com to get access to a quick cash alone in his little his one business state that's right Linda genius dot com is the new and smart way to get cash when you need cash fast Linda geniuses bill to help you find a loan regardless of your credit score just go to Linda genius dot com now she\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall today in orange\nMaking long lost one of the papers on TALK radio Ninety eight\nThen somebody while I see [noise]\n\nYeah yeah yeah I'm here I'm just looking on digesting the polio soundbite Russia [noise] our back Rush Limbaugh at eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to ...\nThere is a story here from CNBC it's it's another story about the economy here and I'm frankly done that anybody in the drive by just reporting this as accurately as they are us just seeing written went was rise in household well this is according to\nCredits we um [noise] you know we now have we have the news yesterday that we have\nSeven million job openings and six million unemployed and we're we have one million more jobs open than there are people to fill them which means it's\nA it's a workers market we've had a a boy's market assessed story yesterday that the economy is going so gang busters that it may blow to smithereens all the polling on the\nBlue wave household wealth than the u._s. just continuing to see an unbroken spell of wealth gains\nChina has replaced Japan in second place in the world wealth according to Credit Suisse says lead latest report\nOn a on global wealth [noise] now this is happening people are living it and I guarantee there's a party out there that is not happy about this the Democratic party all of this great economic news is threatening to them why would that be what about this could possibly\nMake any well question answers itself [noise]\nTalking about the Democrats [noise]\n... ... talk radio Ninety eight forty three and Fifteen path W.

Democrat voters who describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent\nThat here we go now this is a long piece but this next scrapped assist them money crafts\nReady well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party decisively leftward according to Gallup their share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine to sixty one percent of because of this gross white liberals are now roughly ... percent of all democratic voters while a substantial percentage or a Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute into those are the level of white working class was told I go to hell and all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high for Republican candidates while a substantial percentage Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing it anywhere near\nThe rage that they had been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats placing a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story about the Republican Party Owens white suburban women\nRight we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrat liberalism\nWho are back back at them and shrimp boat show you know I'd be met for hey Sean Hannity back today right after Russia [noise]\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned

[noise]\nNow look it's it takes a lot to get something passed me here we have McCaskill area filled rent a sit in Tennessee and we got to do over at work and we've got this guy tester\nIn Montana and they're all trying to tell us that they're not wild liberal left or is there a centrist and all this except we find out that's not really true or not but here comes Thomas Bee Saul saying don't believe them this move to the left or the Democratic\nParty is real and it's solid so Thomas Bee ends all is giving\nHis own Democrats have been a problem he's calling them out\nAnd\nSunny Arabia gets more time how many ... secretary of state my pound ham briefing President Trump on his meetings in Riyadh and in Turkey which accuses Saudi Arabia killing missing journalist ...\nThere are lots of stories out there about what has happened\nThere is no place for that kind of language you shouldn't have said that said Speaker Paul Ryan who is usually measured in his criticism of the president Republican a strategic Liz mayors have yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern when\nYou constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal today written Mr certainly there's a name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you [noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in ... he was the premier journalist you not was not an executive but he practically ran the place\n[noise]\nI met him at Mr Buckley home here in ... or good much land tomorrow was a a typical criminalist which means means weapons so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump the always concern is that Trump's outrageousness no longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\nAnd then if the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing the Democrats have to get their people to the polls\n\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican or maybe the headline is true the Republican fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a suburban woman [noise] thinking that\nI Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut\nThis election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past\nAnd have voted Republican know how important it I just don't I don't think the media's merges lesson yet ... this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to Louis maybe hold elections\nBut but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that and so they take these things that they think are just outrageous\nInsults just so totally\nPermissible in American politics and they assume this is it that Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video then it\nThis isn't going to do it [noise]\nFrom the ... dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the also this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador are saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democratic party land because they want to open borders an existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large law people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm election\n... as we discuss somebody's paying for this somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking thing that they've got to be using facilities somebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say of the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected this is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion\nAt the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\n\nSo what's the calculation here while we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on a track there's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incident of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe started by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if they if that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump the Trump work there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\n\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lennie head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waving so you're up next\nThe afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the
