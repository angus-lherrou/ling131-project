meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one true good four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate

a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life

Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are thanks to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI and it's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\n\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOkay thank you Mr solve it needs to go to waste they're going to go to waste so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up [noise]\nAnd Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC's white course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might

am I see what is the lead a headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your White House expands FBI profit so what the hell is that so I clicked on a lake here what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly Nick at the same fingers New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview anyone\nNecessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said at his press conference today where he's\nNow I don't want to limit anything I said guys don't do this that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations withdrawal I'm not\nThat's fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting invest which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells FBI interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four people\nThey want the FBI to talk to this\nAfter Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise]\nThis is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nHas somehow incomplete\nSomebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with the woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\n\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real the Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller they stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop is\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start vouch Jang for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\n\nBut that's not happening somehow or letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here into Kevin has been half baked lukewarm and incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible Kavanaugh is not\n\nSomebody look we've got a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it did no such thing\nBut he sure fell from the bait I Am not limiting and the thing I it's totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them properly Democrats well here's Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI you say there's there's some people in my town here really really screwing approach and I need to get something done about ... years in a while you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\n\nWhat rush rush this is the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that [laughter]\nAnd one
