L. A. C. [noise]\nThanks [noise]\n[noise] I'll talk to you later per se [noise] flown to the program\nGlad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating is really really really a fascinating is one of those guys to his you know really walk through the fire for his principal um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump sounds from South problem\nIs he's a reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a the ... will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats that the Democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times today isn't the headline in the New York times\nObama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure\nAnd it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder\nUm Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take 'em behind the gym and beat the hell out of him I\nMean this is as they sit there in the new democratic ... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that they did what they're saying\nThey are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who is the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said the holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized trained but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service to civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat justice hard nose they at least tried to hide it this switch\nIs now overt we are harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said there's now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the the that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X. things might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nBack very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nDon't want to think of themselves as you know as you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who\nWho go down these roads ... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people and the totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the All right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the ban and\nBut the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really outside of Steve Bannon you've\nSeen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like a host of I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal\nOkay so [noise] but the point is this guy doesn't even know what he's talking but he goes to the next day they basically figured oh Rush Limbaugh those are leaving climate change do people in the north but just rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy\nBecause while this guy is jumping all in my chili listened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this\nYou know they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking their lives\nDoes\nUniversity of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some obscure little\nRag or penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it this is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is doing range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\n\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michaels in tends to be on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claim that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction others op so this clown\nWho is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat literally this one is what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up\n\nAnd they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the ...\n\nI mean this [laughter] if it if it weren't so irresponsible that would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're an African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\nA professor of engineering\nLiterally tells people that if you want to stop\nHurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium who literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas where as\nDemocrats they would be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush actually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston there were\nSome even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\n\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking on a tax on the Internet who are claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was tearing that hurricane Bush himself the president was fearing the hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply\nWay people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out\nEvery particular issue that's why they recycle the ten year morning [noise]\nPutting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall a civilian will get started\nAnd Fifteen

screaming at my husband does if he represented every clueless guy\nOn the planet\nI announced that I hate all men and I wish all men were dead if one of my grandchildren yelled and something that ridiculous I'd have to stifle all laugh\nMy husband at fifty years did not have to stifle the laugh he took in dead serious like I don't have I doubt that he did [noise] I don't think this guy is probably ever laugh with his wife in fifty\nYears [noise] but that's just me speculating let me continue\nMy husband did not defend his remarks he did not defend the men he sat hunched and hurt and he listens to me\nFor a moment it occurred to me to be grateful that I married to a man who will listen to a woman\nThe wins calmed ever so slightly in that moment when I realized he was okay and then the storm surge winds up in me as I realized the pathetic impotence of nice men's plan to rebuild the wreckage by listening to women\n[noise] guys you really tell hopeless does this guy get everything right and he\nBlew it\nHe listened to everything and his wife still well up and exploded because what he was doing there wasn't enough\nAnd yet there's nothing else he could have done [noise]\nHas my range rushed through the streets of my mind and I'll guarantee you most of them are one way folks toppling every memory of every good thing my husband has ever done and there are scores of\nYou know this woman said she's gotten mad hear her husband is not responsible for it and she's getting madder and madder and madder and him\nIn the midst of him doing everything right the rages rushing through the streets of her mind toppling every good memory of her husband she's got this is in the Washington Post\nI said the meanest thing I've ever said to him don't you dare sit there and sympathetically promise to change that is what she said to end the meanest thing ever don't say\nThat you're going to stop yourself before your blood out some impatient annoyed controlling remark\nThis woman Seventy she still met their husband controls her I guarantee you what's the other way round [laughter] no I said to him you can't change you are able to change you don't have the skills and you won't do it\nYou are you said or one of the good man you respect women you believe in women you like women you don't hit women you know raped women or in any way abuse women you have applauded and funded feminism for fifty years you're one of the good guys and you cannot change you can listen all you want but that will not create one iota\nWhat Ben this poor guy ... [laughter]\nWhat this woman is saying the guy is perfect and yet he's guilty he's perfect because his perfection will not change anything his\nBeing right on the money everything she wants will not matter\n\nIn the ... century as a feminist movements that have washed up in a way good men have not once organized their own mass movement to change themselves\nAnd their sons or new attack the mean spirited teasing punching saying that passes\nFor male culture not once bastards don't listen to me listen to each other talk to each other or in your power for once the gender war that has broken out in this country is flooding all of our houses it's rising I'm tired of memories that every woman has [noise]\nI\nSaid do what I said about three weeks ago that these women having this irrational hatred that men they're angry so I don't know what's happened to him but something did and that quote as been brought up in the recycle all over the drive by media\nThey lead ching off ... from their boyfriends there just catching the checks\nAnd they're calling it feminism because they're choosing to live that life well that's not feminism her opponent again the highest ranking woman in the air force first female fighter pilot Martha ... Sally [noise]\nHave you seen the polling data on some of the Senate race hits looking bad it's for the Democrats are Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nIs is very real I mean it's\nLooking bad for

money at better or work in Texas and he is continuing to lose grounded Ted Cruz\nI mean there are some I've read speculation that Senate race is over I don't want any of you believing that\nBut it wasn't long ago that Beto was leading crows if you believe the poll it it looks like if the if the election where today and if the polls are right that there isn't anything approaching a blue wave and\nThe Senate and in fact it is a red wave and now there's more evidence for starting to see if I have details coming up\nThat this blue wave in the house may be a a myth so we'll just have to say details coming up let me get to the phones always try to do that in the first hour on open line friday Lake City Minnesota this is Phil I'm Glad you called or high\nHigh Iraq's August first aid that

it recently but might revive it from the archive today just since you brought it up\nThat still all areas beyond description of\nA I hold them back for science degree what NPR graffiti and we used to talk about what is the optimal kept when you hear these are people with the U.S wherever talking\nOf some kind of psychology at Paolo Alto university where I had never heard of Paolo Alto university so I\nBegan to dig deep what is Paolo Alto university\nWhat did I Do there and the short version of the story is it is a play is run by women they ... themselves as a school that prepares women\nTo become experts in psychology their website\n... saw the wonderful things they can do for women and Seventy three percent of the faculty the students whatever are women never on their website is there I mention of seeking men about psychology so I concluded that this is a haven for women\n\nNow this this this professor here from um [noise] Grinnell university Victoria missile\nYeah I I Know women my age who grew up with the Gloria Steinem ms magazine Betty for Dan version of militant feminism\n\nAnd back then it was basically about equal pay for equal work and not getting married and not letting demand defined your happiness a relationship a marriage or what have you\n[noise] but where do these women come up and then where do they get to have I have a theory that it has to be it has to derive from the fact that a lot of its media I\nThis particular woman published in the Washington Post\nProbably and listen to NPR religiously probably reads the New York times er religiously probably watches CNN religiously\nAnd as a professor at a university\nThey are surrounded she is surrounded by other like\nMinded women they\nFeed on each other's bad experiences with men they retail and retail story after story after story\nAnd it's kinda like oh Kanye West said yesterday Kanye West said that\nIn groups of people were there isn't any male energy people are going to go nuts\nAfter awhile Kanye West noted philosopher an Oval Office\nVisitor made that point yesterday\nAnd I think that's where this comes from I think hanging around with with the other angry politicized leftist\nWomen whatever anger there is gets\nRetold retold and it becomes more and more intense and that raises this woman does not hide the average actor range the almost on contained a bull anger even for her husband who she is perfection\n\nThis the reason why this is Rob this is the American left folks this is the Democrat Party this is the group of people that thinks Hillary Clinton is the Hillary is one of these women\nHillary Clinton is exactly one of these women\nRunning around filled with range uncontrollable rage\nHatred an anger that is compressed and intensifying each and every day\n\nAnd I'm telling you no matter what the drive by just think it's not infectious it does not make you want to join the team\nIt makes you think that these people are nuts\nIt's that far out of the mainstream yet to them it is the main stream\nAnd this is not going to say well this is not a good day for me to move but actually it happened yesterday New York judge drops sexual assault charge against Harvey Weinstein\nNow we're not hearing much about this shockingly because Kanye West is eating up all the oxygen in the news bubble\n\nDisgraced movie mogul Harvey Wang's team has won last

Fifteen than when you went lazy [noise]\nMan on the books the insanity is all over the place here is a case at Politico today and this by John Harris and ... John Harris is one of the founders of political used to be the Washington Post me and so these are you know these are not chump change him skewer wacko ... well they may be that\nBut I mean they're not they're widely no they're they're highly respected right in the mainstream of left wing activist journalists\nAnd the headline of this story Trump may not be crazy but the rest of us are getting their fast\n\nI I I don't know where to start with this I mean even the first the first line here CNN before lovemaking is not his idea of a turn on\nBut she can hardly turn it off in gross that she is in the latest unnerving gyrations of Washington so obviously these are psychologist stories psychologist couches are filling up as American seek relief from Trump anxiety disorder that's the ...\nI I don't believe this for a minute I think this may be the case in Washington it certainly will be the case the Upper West side and probably in a lot of Hollywood but nationwide people are not seeing shrinks to deal with Trump anxiety disorder\nBut yet this guy these two people think well all of America is if it's happening in Washington or New York and it's happening everywhere\nSo a psychologist tail here CNN before lovemaking not his idea of a turn on but his wife she can't turn CNN off\nSo engrossed in the latest unnerving gyrations of Washington who else to blame for this but Donald Trump a president who excites hot feelings in many quarters\nHas cooled them considerably in the bed rule ... above Philadelphia ... so you got people who are going to psychiatry now blaming Trump for the

they're travails according to national surveys in interviews with mental health professionals are not as anomalous as one might suppose though no even when symptoms are not sexual in nature and there

of Americans the the nation's future\nAs a very or somewhat significant source\nOf stress\nOr more plausible interpretation for all of this in the view of some psychological experts is that Trump has

[noise] but she put it out and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it it's fairly common that these people on the left\n[noise] engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ... the Democrats blue wave is drying up oh that's how it would be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly government twenty Eighteen ... terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely till Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave what if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district\nYou don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must be in the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could a generic ballot the lemon name on it by this time when you start pulling people among three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the authority and the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other state that they have\nThey held by incumbents at at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats so [noise] it's [noise]\nLet me go state by state to show where this is all happening but the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional gear party out of power winds ... that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls which say that's exactly what's going to happen and you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see won a close race to some of the could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need\nTo tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities or reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wants to the murder of\nThousands nobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know what\nThe worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and\nNor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who did covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the end Marcy an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo the trick is how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars ending and people start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits of thing how do you do all and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore\nAnd violence in the movie it's it's ... in uh in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten may be informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this can avoid the politics\nBut it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause you're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals\nWho happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer he was a mass murderer of people in the room\nThat nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie of target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so when I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there sort of set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left\nAbortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain has won\nThe ah the actor who plays a gazelle himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings and for somebody\nThat's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people who put their careers on the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy or directing\nYou're recall the story yesterday I told you about Jamal ... the Saudi journalist\nWho is reportedly\nBeen dismembered murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nBecause of his criticism of the crown prince and Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin solemn up\nI went through every nook and cram any of the story ...\nSaudi journalist very critical of the so called reform movement in Saudi Arabia being led by the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman on popularly my friend is NBS he's thirty\nTwo millennials got all these reform plans that ... show he didn't think he really means and think they were true been very very critical juncture show me want to get married\nYou had to get a legal marriage license or document chose to go to the Soviet sorry Saudi consulate in Istanbul and nobody has seen him since he went in and now the Turks say they have audio recordings\nThat prove he was murdered in the side\nThat the president of the United states has talked about this is a very serious thing but says look we have an outstanding deals with the Saudis that we cannot derailed just because of this this is outraged the media\nEven though Trump\nWas initially very hard on Saudi Arabia claiming if this happened and if it was proven this is very very bad we're not going to look the other way\nWhile here is it about Lebanon and this was this [noise] this is one of the things I shoot myself I should figure to wait for not having predicted this yesterday when I told you the story [noise]\nWe have a tweet here from a guy named Daniel Klaidman now he's the editor in chief in Yahoo\nYahoo News here's his tweets\nA close friend of Washington Post columnist Jamal ... tells Michael is a cough and me that the Saudi\nCrown prince Mohammed bin ... may have felt emboldened in parentheses to murder the journalist\n\nBy Trump's anti media rhetoric Trump hates journalists and he would not react if we kill one journalist says colleague indeed so fury [noise] and so now with ... have\nFought to have been murdered and dismembered and by the way they think now that he's been buried in a plot of grass\nAnd the console the back yard and the console is not leaving when the consulate there Turkish officials cannot get in and search or dig up\nYou know the old diplomatic immunity thing so now Yahoo News the American media\nIs attempting here to blame Donald Trump ... Donald Trump and his open disdain and criticism of the media is sent to have made Mohammed bin ... comfortable with the fact that he can get away with murder and journalist because Donald Trump made him think it'd be okay\nThis is what the American media is now [noise]\nBeginning districts that this was just a tweet from a Yahoo guy holding cough but this don't be surprised if\nThis starts blowing up [noise]\nFrom this point forward right now [noise] save\nRight here on radio voice free\n[noise] [noise] [noise] can't get no satisfaction stone Nineteen sixty five boroughs before we got back to the phones one quick\nThing there's a and M. B. C. opinion piece that uh has appeared in opposition to the guys know movie\nAnd here's the headline with his face legal abortion is vilified by the pro life cause no movie which inadvertently shows the dystopia of a post row America so whereas we have a bunch of journalists trying to blame Donald Trump\n\nFor inspiring Mohammed bin ... to murder a Saudi journalist\nNow we have this enemy see peace which is basically saying\nThat what this movie is inadvertently showing is what will happen if abortion ever becomes illegal guys like God's noble spring up everywhere that God's now could not have become the mass murderer he became\n\nIf abortion would have been legal which is a crock he did his monitoring\nAfter abortion to become legal [noise] but they're trying to say everybody you know you better you better not get what you wish for here because if you ever if you ever get abortion we have a real versus Wade overturned you're going to have people like guys know popping up left and right which misses the entire point of this movie\nBut that's not a surprise at opponents would try to miss Kass what's going on with this tweet saying that the\nCrown prince may have felt in Bolden by Trump's anti media rhetoric to murder a journalist [noise] yeah that happens in this country right we have a history of murdering journalist Donald Trump got\nThat it was the first was the first hurdle is the Trump per quarter to be killed the company told me [noise] he's irresponsible jackass is okay\nHead back to the phones to Jim in Jupiter, Florida right up the road great to have you with us or Hi\nHey thanks rush rush I'd that down in Miami last week driving up work I pass by what is to be the ground breaking up the largest mall in the United states\nAnd it got me to thinking I said to myself this is off plus ski underwater two years ago it was all supposed to the underwear all of Miami and it was based on a few thousand at seven Nobel Prize winning award winner Albert Gore predicted it full of Miami manmade global warming\nYou know the rising sea level twenty feet\nWhich would be underwater and I just got to think well you know he's not good at predicting the future maybe you can explain the past or someone please explain how about twenty thousand you're white you know\nThis is really a great point and you're you're you're making a really great point here and and because it you're right on the money Al Gore had said\nJust in general that current shorelines and he has he has mentioned Miami in South Florida in Manhattan he has predicted when they are going to succumb to rising sea levels will be underwater and he did say\nAbout Miami\nIt was only a few short years at Miami certain parts of it would be inundated by rising sea levels and one of the places where he said so they are breaking ground or one of the biggest malls\nUnder the you have to ask yourself\nWho in their right mind would go out and get the financing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Nashville", "day": "12"}
