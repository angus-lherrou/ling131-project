we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on you you watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports than at\nRestaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working\nWhat could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass am threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do not words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just spreading hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired and ball leave me and has\nEspecially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of the worst that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do\nYou might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it [noise]\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are\nThirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics that was among many other things\nIs average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on a C Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of here\nAnd Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\n\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that evidence says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pick up according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project I pick up a twenty five safe twenty two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is the great unknown as these rallies continue now another retired historian and political analyst sent an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to have it it was just this morning and I'm going to identify who

missing a Republican syringe\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all\nThis down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by\nTrump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys a showing everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to beat curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late syringe\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton a lead Trump\nBut fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the post pick that up\nOr at least some of it\nIt's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg says but it could it could go either direction Democrats just don't win big or they could lose ... what what is this decision all\nOf a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nPolls couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when\nThe polls have

afternoon to you on TALK radio not he ate point three Fifteen ten W well ac [noise]\nGuy answering that question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaign named [noise] two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nSo no I mean how how many ... or ... or the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterm the Clinton now is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet the Clintons announced this nationwide Katie I'm your third team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people to come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about\nPolitics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in the Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the chef Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger their wife or their mirror here's not say that just it's just too packed it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let\nTime on the phone here

dangerous\nDreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail [noise]\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information it's just not out there for the masses to obtain now being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended targets whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered the Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that\nCame out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do this is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for\nA Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWould you make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way they thought\nDo not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this\nThis is not going the way they have assured us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believed their pollsters if the polls\nTell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it then they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nSkeptical no it's not ... as a journalist your
