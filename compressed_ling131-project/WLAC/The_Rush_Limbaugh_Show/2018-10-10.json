Patel and I just want to say thank you um and that's I think you know you always say that if if we're to save the nation that it'll be your audience that plays a huge role in it and I think that's true because\nI think when history looks back if we do save ourselves from this that you are going to be a huge part of that and uh I really appreciate your approach in what you're doing\nWell and I just wanted to thank for that that is um the amazing thank you so much how old are you Isaac twenty six twenty six and what are you doing with your life\nI I own a tree service and wake up\nFor a few bad an entrepreneur twenty six good for you how how's business give yourself a plug\nIt yeah it's it's good uh I can ... trees there is a business has been great um I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for I haven't read it yet but\nI Am an outrage I've already I just made it out to you so it's going to be on the way so I'm going to put you on hold we'll get your address and where to send it and we will send it out to you do you ever do tree service up in the Dallas area\nInvading Iraq [noise]\nUh yeah occasionally I go that far north\nOkay well I I may reach out to you 'cause I've got a lot of trees that needs to be a town and we all over the years yeah we don't like them all down during their health either beautiful I just caught 'em all down\nA thanks Isaac\nTake my home I'm gonna hang in here with my home Stan I'm going to stay here with my pets I Am not leaving you can't kick\nMe out so there will be some people who\nWill hang on and state now this area is popularly known even among the locals as the redneck\nRiviera in modern political parlance it means a bunch of poor white privilege people lived there and\nThe drive buys are are surprisingly interested in this\nI say surprisingly because there's not a syndrome major population center\nThat can be totally wiped out that they could equate which she she how dangerous global warming is\nBut there is a midterm election coming up and there is going to be a federal response to this and as far as the media is concerned as an opportunity to federal response won't be any good and so they can call this Trump's Katrina don't get mad at me for talking about this because I'm telling you\nRight now is exactly how assignment editors and producers throughout the drive by media are looking at this\nThey're looking at this as a potential political event\nThat they're hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the mid term elections that are only three weeks away there is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum running against Ron this and this\nAnd then Rick Scott the current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill Nelson so there's a lot politically at stake here you can't deny it folks\nAnd you can't you cannot ignore\nThe way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this um it's it's got the global warming component that's number one\nAs a category four hundred and fifty miles an hour lots of destruction a human a destruction as well\nIt's it's got all the ingredients there it is the Republican voting stronghold of the state in in the er an abuse of mending\n[noise] no no\nIf you look you can get mad at me or you I'm just telling you I Know the media you may think insensitive me\nTo be speaking this way I'm not I'm telling you how they drive by maybe our planet and they'll react at some point little ranks failed or go out there\nI Can't vote meaning the these kinds of things were being showed about ocean imminent danger of ... I'm just telling it it won't be long to find out\nIt's a hurricane kind of came out of nowhere it was a little tropical storm down off the primary tobacco growing area of western Cuban known as the ...\nThat it sprang life as a category one and the national Hurricane Center you know this thing is it's looking very bad nobody was paying much attention to it and then all of a sudden it's a cat free and it's making a ...\nFor Panama City in Panama City beach\nAnd here we are um the media is\nNow focused on this do you think Mr certainly do you think there is I Know it's going to sound crazy\nBut do you think that Dr biased might be looking for a bit of a respite\nFrom all this ... stuff you don't think so and you don't think the hurricane\nIs providing just dumb and Terry opportunity for\nAll I Know they hope it turns into Trina for Trump I've just I've ... capital all day hoping turns ... and Rick Scott of course you know they want it to her turn that Katrina for every Republican involved here\nUm you know what Hillary Clinton went out the other day in an interview with Christian among poor and pretty much admitted\nEverything I had been trying to warn people love about the American left and the Democratic party she went out there and get her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be an civil\nAnd she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return to civility\n\nI mean they're making that case they're proving the point\nAnd there isn't I don't see you know all of this in all of this\nCrazy deranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist I haven't heard one elected Democrat did announce it\nI haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it I haven't heard one\nBe elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back I haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they\nAll are and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility what did I tell you yesterday\nWere not in a battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas\nThey don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas they see\nAmerica today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify\nThe people who want to be part of America not anything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window because all that's tainted all of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves\nAnd their families and their descendants and they didn't care about minorities and they didn't care about transgender where did I see some state I've got it in a stack I'll have to find some stayed on birth certificates is now going to offer a third option third gender option\nOn the birth certificate\nThey're ... they're crazy they're deliberately not they are at war with science there at war with biology they're at war with physics\nAnd they are at war with common sense\n\nHillary Clinton is not helping them with any of this it's okay to be an civil it's okay to claw F the doors of the Supreme Court and try to get in to stop the swearing in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh we've got that we've got some reaction to it coming up as well\nAnd all eyes remain fixated once you get on hurricane Michael this next forty five minutes to an hour will tell the tale in terms of the actual\nLandfall it's going to be anywhere from ah Mexico beach up to Panama City moving North West along the coastline Mexico's Mexico beach I think as well as all the way up to Panama City in Panama City beach but this I wall\nAccording to all of that and I've got some fascinating satellite photography here from the guards sixty and satellites it's interesting the way they do this you know how they take the um the radar and they attach different\nColors to it now what I'm looking at is sheer solid\nBlack surrounding me I ... and most of the black is on the south and the west side and then it gets\nA little lighter there's some great then ... then then bright red and yellow and then can and then or in general and green and blue on the edges\nOut these colors do not represent rain and intensity they represent cloud tops they represent the temperatures at the cloud tops which determines condensation and can determine the intensity of rainfall but\nPeople watching this had no idea they think oh my God look at that may look it must be raining a hundred\nI mean a hundred and twenty five is no slouch if you think that you've experienced Seventy five mile an hour winds well maybe it's not bad I couldn't either it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus ought to Seventy five months just not twice\nWhen you're in it if there is a multiplier effect\nOf massive wind speed so that if if the fastest in the highest when you've been in is Seventy five miles an hour and you'd think OK a cat for is going to double this it won't ... on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of\nA hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five the just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr so hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it the further you get from the high end depending on the structure be the more the wind speed\nDecreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst when the storm\n\nAre only in the eye wall area and people can look at these storms and the graphics while hundred and fifty miles an hour winds all that's all I met a whole building it now it isn't not trying to downplay the or the damage I've just I've learned all this uh we live in hurricane alley here\nAnd every time one of these things I moved here from Nineteen Ninety seven and I quickly became a consumer hurricane expert I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that they use\nAnd I became an expert in where the actual worst damage of a hurricane is you do not want to get a direct hit\nEverybody well yeah of course Russia everybody knows that yeah but but outside the direct hit the damage or the strength of the of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit\nIt's always the direct hit that that\nIs the most destructive and then it it starts to decline as you get away from me I depending upon the\nStrength of the storm is going to have a wide destructive swat as a as a category for a ears Governor Scott of Florida this was this morning a press conference audio soundbite number one just to give you a taste of how local\nOfficials in the governor's office are dealing with\nI just spoke with a president who again offered all available federal resources we continue being passed in contact with FEMA\nAnd their team in the state of emergency operations center that includes experts from homeland security the EPA the department of defense health and Human Services and the Army Corps of engineers along our coast communities are going to see a Nashville devastation\nOn imaginable devastation there was a little hype always in this to get people to listen\nTo get their attention\nBut there's always a lot of hype and these things and as an expert a local resident expert I can tell you that people who live in these areas for a long time I've heard this over and over again and very rarely are these storms as bad as they predict and so people over the course of time\nAdopt an attitude yeah they're making it worse than that it's going to be for whatever reason I started to scare everybody get 'em to evacuate or what have you\nUm\nPeople deal with these in different ways who live in areas and have experience dealing with um now\nI'm\nThere have been four major hurricanes in the two years of the Trump presidency\nAnd\nNot a one of them outside of this mess in Puerto Rico not one of them have the media been able\nTo label Trump's Katrina they've tried in advance they have not been able to see the\nYou're good to Glenn Beck weekday morning today on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen than double the ...\nHelp me out here what Taylor Swift come out and say the other day about an anti Trump or did you come up\nPro pro democratic did what oh yeah it was Tennessee she came out against black burn right uh what in the media say the media said record turnout record voter registration after Taylor Swift\nHow many people bought that that is such Koch guy there is no way to measure that that's wishful thinking but the reason I bring this up and I don't know Taylor Swift from a pilot call\nI don't know that you can put a bag of manure in a bag out there and I wouldn't know the difference in Taylor Swift now\nThe story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time low in ratings while how the hell can that be if she is generating massive record voter registration\nAnd then the host the television show an all time low record ratings don't I don't have one thing or another but Taylor Swift I don't I'm not comparing hurt your bag of a newer I'm saying\nThat's how it significant\nBut I'm the drive by trying to take these thinks they're so desperate for good news they're desperate\nFor you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world in three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord ... a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the held uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats\nWhat are the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill that kind of had a story\nYesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama warmly most popular respected public figures in America shouldn't spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates\nFor the house and Senate this\nColumn is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\n\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nAre the most popular in respect to Democrats with America's such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance of Democrats and the mid term as well the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done for both\nOf these already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and then Trump or first myself\nNow there is a twenty five percent chance\nThat Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not\nQuite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for balding maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats\nHow ever it is also possible of Democrats gain only twenty seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing a Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\nBooed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try\n'em ... Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see if you don't understand love when you see it you do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love\nYou see hatred use the excitement you think you see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies use some house the division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand alongside Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert right says Butowsky warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president\nWho tried to criminalize his opponent [noise] whacked\nWho did what who tried to criminalize who\n\nMy point is again do not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats\nIn their private selves when they talk to each other in private not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... Ning up turnout ... up interest\nAnd they're really flux and ticked off at a bunch of polling\nData there is an NPR poll up there was a Fox News for a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have a renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed to happen\nThat's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white\nConservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand sixteens you remember any pieces before the presidential race anywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey\nYou know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were ...\nThey were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\n\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent but\nNobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised\nGuy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all the press the Trump headquarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nBeen put through what do you make about Hillary\nAnd what message including the president's mocking of Christie ... Ford for her I'm like ... what message does that send to\nWomen and remember women went for President Trump in two thousand six name Hillary said white women did I'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women win for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against\nDemocratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for the very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential elections has Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why this kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n\nThe ... the left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way\nAnd there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the lightest and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here it's a Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly crusty on I'm for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps\nThat judicial system has been viewed by you as the election and joined the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to\nMake sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the\nCourts if you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people\nBut stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak\nEvery liberal idea and belief that\nNow is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws in reality today is because Democrats activism judges have been essentially writing law\nWhen they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most certainly example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning legislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main\nPillars of our constitutional ... the ass not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well\nIt's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other\nWe're not going to destroy each other Hillary Clinton well\nCertainly I Would love to see a return disability Christianity for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the rights of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nAnd Mrs Jay Z Beyonce come out and denounce cognac end and Kim ... to ... they denounce ... and his wife came ... meanwhile Taylor Swift\nHosts some music award show last night nobody watched it the ratings plummeted doing all time low\nSo how can it be the Taylor Swift sponsored inspired massive\nVoter registration drive after criticizing and Democrat or Republican Senate candidate in\nTennessee now where is this massive belief and support if he's got this popularity and people can't wait to do what she says and express\nTheir support in why didn't the same people turn around and watch her show that we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia camp extrapolate to voter registration drives an audience was for award show I can you people can make it up left and right I can draw on my own analogies I can ask these questions\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but that this stuff doesn't um intimidate you I think I think it has an intimidated\nAverage of Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have you is or how you doing\nWell thank you longtime listener measures her first time caller thank you so it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing whereas I listen to do it last night and I can't quote it exactly but\nShe said if you disagree or if if the party is destroying the things you believe in a low that you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic courteous well Republicans\nConservatives I'm being uncivil to the likes of her\nShort would sure what I mean that's the standard if the party that you\nOppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\n[noise] but [noise] [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is justice\nThat is what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nAnd we have no business [noise]\nFighting back are resisting it we deserve\nWhat we've done one eight hundred to seven fifty one thirty seven that's one eight hundred to seven fifty one thirty seven\nI guarantee your friends and co workers will be wowed by your new white smile praying risk free and get free shipping and handling today dar one eight hundred to seven fifty one thirty seven that's one eight hundred to seven fifty one thirty seven\nTrust least company serving Nashville the company dot com [noise]\nWeekday afternoon to you on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen than any one lady\n\nI welcome back yeah we got some juicy audio soundbites coming up there was a there was a new\nRefrain while an old refrain aimed at a new target last night that the Trump rally\nLock her up ah was now\nIt now includes Dianne Feinstein at Trump rallies all that's coming up in the meantime Susan in Cary North Carolina great to have you here Hi\nHi thanks rash thanks for taking my call\nYou bet anytime [laughter]\nHey I Want her in for a while

you you you basically check the website twenty four seven the apple and the podcast every day\nWell I mean like I say I've been working I'm a fan of yours for thirty\nYears I understand that sure yeah I I'm so you think you'll go you listen to this program the podcasts and check the website and then you watch a Trump rally and you hear Trump said things that you\nHeard or read a ... my website is that right\nOh yeah I mean I hear him say specific things that I Know he you know he's smart that he doesn't come up with in South but so I mean I can see him listening to your podcast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know if the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance and he is is that but\nYou know who knows but he's told me he does I I I've I'm very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how do you\nGet the podcast everyday how have your range to receive it\nWell I have your app and I download your podcast\nRight there right there on the app

advantage of the of the of the opportunity we were among the first to make to make content available in this program available via podcast\nAll these people out there with their podcast these days cereal this and breakfast look that and all that we were at the front of the gang of people do it and podcasts\nYeah and I'm Glad I'm Glad I I get in some other cats but I don't know a lot about them and um so I just listened to yours right\nI was up on a pod cast is is the is a transmission of ah of audio on what was an iPod pod cast is how it got to the original name now the eye pot has been incorporated into the iPhone and the eye pad\nClose to the I I'm Glad this guy says close to the ... that that's where would you read about the high wins in the race that's where the brunt of it is now this storm is so strong that it's bad as you get away from me I but the real bad stuff fuzzy I decide\nWell I think I saw thirty miles or maybe not no it's not that big now looking at not that the smaller it is the more intense usually\n[noise] um [noise] and\nAs usual lets the northwestern quadrant here with the wind speeds beating up and heading in that\nDirection I'm hearing one more bite with the president and the let's say you're still with the FEMA director and homeland secure\nWe don't know I Know I was going to Pennsylvania looks like there are thousands of people who are alive and probably will do that tonight and we're going to go down here as soon as we can we don't want to interfere with anybody we want to go as soon as possible you have you know right nearby we have\nThousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails on this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to disabuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump ... seem to have any real interest in seeing doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not\nConvey\nProper information about him is is only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media you should have the best that and podcast or should have\nThe ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments at a ... liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote it came across years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism I just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety harbor is civility were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle ear barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what was your question more Trump isn't it well\nIt seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one morning then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh issue was a labor laws and um when what purpose\n... my ... the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in honor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my boys they're not that different there just mass getting less today\nHere is no read about it in the paper tomorrow rush on the ... being that we're not we're not going\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a data of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ... year\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B. I. B. L. E.\nTime favorite traffic follows Fox News on TALK radio and I said boy three hundred and fifty then W well I think [noise]\nI just watch it a little bit of Fox News I got a reporter out they're standing in the middle of all this hurricane his name is Jeff flock [noise] and he was telling him he was telling us up to the chefs humid out here like I've been out here we are all of this ship I'll tell you we much\nRather cover man versus nature than men versus man and a day and shipped all oh yeah\nYeah I'm so my heart melted [noise]\nFox News alerts hurricane Michael makes landfall on the ... the strongest storm ever to hit the Florida Panhandle just shy of a category five Fox is Evan brown tracking it live from Miami\n[noise] since ... the campaign see so I think I think Fox is dialing back on the potential you will time claims even though there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that they're not as many people are seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just\nIf you have any observation will power is at all you can't miss that these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time\nThese are people that are a beep and happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally in your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa\nYou contrast that with with that unforgettable picture to me of these kids are slowing at the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon\nRight I didn't get banging on the door and blowing up the door trying to get in\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies\nOr the exact opposite and I don't mean the\nPeople at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event\nAnd even if you do have some happy people in the Democrats sponsored the audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off and I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's\nAbout a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way but found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current\nAbout Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nUsually the documents well\n[noise]\nI don't want to have you ever see no [noise] no no we [noise]\n[laughter]\nAnd I think that don't get about five and can you blame\nWorst body language on another words did she get a hundred percent and match join our citizens and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\n\nYou don't hand matches do an arsonist you don't give power do an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in a wicked PBS\nAnd trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up spending that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so used to having it throw in the right back at him with the same force they dish it out they are so on you use to having their ideas and behavior being criticized\nAnd they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [noise]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand sixty to two

lost civil war in the Republican Party of flooding GOP lawmakers abandoning their nominee\nThe worst maybe yet to come with Trump they may be staring at a total collapse of the party by election day the cumulative effect has finally caught up to us Hillary when when they\nDo you want to hear the names of their that did it and the names are Matthew Dowd he used to be a Bush adviser who is not just

Access Hollywood video was released by the way it's very close\n\nJohn Heilemann here's all losing and probably has lost the election or rummy sexual harasser Charlie Rose this isn't on when the ...

NBC the worst maybe up to come with Trump\nThey may be staring at a total collapse of the party do we just saw that headline yesterday at the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you wouldn't think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\n\nThey do not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable and predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\n'cause they know when they return those old media forums along with the shiny brand new DVD's or thumb drives it's able to achieve their goal and when you think about it nearly every picture taking family has a challenge to how do you digitizing share pictures and videos of important people and events\nFrom years

amazed how many women were actually and I tend to\nFly by wire you amazed well\nI just keep hearing that the suburban women have completely left the Republican Party and that was the exact opposite of what I witnessed last side of the political\nMind can imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage innocent all that then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nWas I I don't know is is that any feedback from any other ... you get feedback from\nOr what about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there could you detect that men were husbands or are they a fight\nThe guy that I was sitting next to brought his daughter he took a lot of small night's sleep springs thought I was just amazed that the ... I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the Republican face I think that\nOf course there isn't this idea that this Republican war on women is a completely manufactured ally\n\nYou know Mitt Romney being asked in a debate by Stephanopoulos states ought to have the right to ban contraception wide who's talking about doing that George I don't care do you think so and Romney stumbled around in the summer and finally made the mistake of answering the question\nRomney's says Exxon contraception Republican war on women was really boring and ... it's\nAbsurd it's amazing the things they get away with the idea that the Republican Party he eats half the population\nI have never understood how that worked\nHow they pull that off in non synthetic [noise]\nGlad you saw that last night\nOn Hannity today it too late after rush it's all happening right here on TALK radio Ninety eight twenty three and Fifteen cents W.

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh out of eagerness to show a pattern obstruction\nYou have your mayor told\nElle magazine in her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew the key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors and that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere was a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I I'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story that was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just do a ... a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false stories first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern obese you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation\nBe it from Boise Ford or be from Ramirez or from Avon ladies client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well then use those words but we wanted to show a pattern so essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts invention that fun of it yesterday but with his mom rule as it is and that Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the mom and they left and the accident\nAnd then fattening or if things again to talk people um it just hadn't have worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything on fire but Trump stickers and our yard on our cars", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "10"}
