mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nCall today and get started\nDa da da and Fifteen ten W well a queen of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm\nAway from its intentions and it's designed this town to and in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration will look to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out to\nBeyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant a there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America meant so why did he claimed it\nAnd was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique sounding\nConverted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack look and there's a poll out here today this was the Daily Caller de Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study\nThat has been taking a [noise]\nYou know you'd like to not believe this by the facts on the grounds as to what you see [noise]\nEven though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify of some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man\nJust does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people do not need do not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress on how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjured up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are doing their best to erase male natural mailed characteristics for as many young guys as they can\nAnd since guys want to power around with women\nWhatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course he got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell\nWhen they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women they get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become\nConversant and it just the nature of things and so they're being\nHighly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not\nJust targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence base here\n\nNot just flapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael ...\nA guy published yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title\n[noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I have been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men oppose that\nReminds me hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of it but I Do but it would be the end but it would have six and seven [noise]\n\nPoke quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal though except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\n[noise] another poll quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic American ideal\nOf white male privilege because Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long ... he blah burned like a newborn he has plot to end his career you see\nHe hasn't had a series of goals and achieve them all all that guy is a dangerous\nSchemer he has plotted to get on the Supreme Court where he can a rule against minorities and women and Latino sent this band aches and gays lesbians transgendered don't you know this has been a lifelong plotting strategy\nA I realize a lot of people think that that's what so that's that's what's in store here\nAnd of course I'm hearing is going to happen I'm hearing from drones of you who say the proof is the timing that she's going to do this after this program and I mean it means Russia can't being thing you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly is absolutely thinks that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I'm going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone to many first hours this week without getting to the phones that changes today especially being open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nNow however that rush a good to talk with you I'm this Monica McClain who you were\nJust speaking of the person that contacted Amish Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony ... uh she\nShe used the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how are those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in mainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been\nReported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example or Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean in her and the testimony she goes she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this moniker McLean\nCorrect yes ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when ... Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that has come out yet [noise] uh I'm Wondering if not is it is the Democrat oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nA\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it was certainly the goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nNo it's not about to come out that's the whole point you know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead Lynn Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen\nExcelling anyone can do at\nAny case they're wondering if you're a match donating a lot easier than you think [noise] so wherever you are go ahead and fly about ... not a gift of life dot\nOrg and get a free cat ... to your home or find a donor drive in your area for the you can fly the cheek and ... it's only a minute of the time but it can get some went off the rest of their life\nYou can listen to the coast to coast any time with our heart radio it's just a great way for you to stay connected with this program for ever you might be the ... heart radio lap downloaded enjoy it it have some\nProblem around ... pretty common activity and a half [noise]\n... von ...\n... at home I'm not\nGoing to mean middle around for ... which could refer to her for\nUm for millions of learn more about the ... ...

it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations that like the way you have claimed\nTo reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details ... therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in my October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried W Ramirez Julie sweating that kinda represented what what what graphene is getting at here how much confirmation if you had with his with\n\nSenator Feinstein senator horizon ... how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching whatever I mean he's loaded for bear this was the kind of college out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken\nSenators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules and and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept a running back to the microphone do run into these ... are they the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact rebel neo soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a Grassley with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule\nWhen you hear things about get in their face by other people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they you're coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to\nConfirm judge Kevin ... before\nThat was during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth heat up I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nFit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it\nI got an email last night from Salinas veto who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously she went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh jihadists sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump ...\nThere's are they're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nEr into as a heat wave in Kaiser is one of the ... the ex wife bought back all in the letter to Feinstein Leyland Kaiser is referred to as a heated this has led the analysts to believe that Ford didn't write\nThe letter Ford would know that we ... would presumably no that Leland Kaiser is not a man\nIf we can\nKaiser is one of the Boise for its best buttons and she would know she's a woman but she's refer to as a heat so now we're back to Monica McLean balls Xi's buddy who helped her ride the letter from her home in robot Delaware\n\nGuess what McLean is a former FBI agent\nSaid to have worked as a spokesperson for for Preet Bharara Preet Bharara former staffer for Senator Schumer he went on to become U.S attorneys southern district for New York so Trump fired him and uh and now he is one of the biggest never Trump or is out there\n... claims lawyer is\nDavid Law firm in front of the archives the Washington Post February ... this guy was instrumental in the process the way it was the prosecutor in in charge\nOf a well there's plenty to hang on let me complete\nThe opposite of Glenn Beck weekday mornings at eight on TALK radio not eat point three and the beans and really well with other countries [noise]\nOkay to review and heard a letter to Feinstein balls the Ford refers to her best friend Leyland Kaiser is a he falls the Fords best friend is a woman mostly porn will notice\nSo if we win Kaiser's referred to as a he and the letter it's logical to conclude in Boise for getting write the letter\nOkay well then who might have helped her well that would be Monica McLean at who's home ... was\nIn ... Delaware at the time the letter was written McLean former FBI spokesperson also worked for ...\nThe reason I'm going through all this is the ball the Ford is is using people that are tired and lame at the hip and the heart and brain the Democrat Party activism\nFrom the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\nNow Monica McLean lawyer happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David aloft men helped oversee\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server\nProblem which she was exonerated ... also helped oversee the Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in two thousand six name\nSo how is it the balls the Ford ends up in the home of a woman who is tied to the D. R. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who weren't involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation\nHow does that happen if you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz er Palo Alto and you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court and you don't think he should be because you think one time he attacked you\nYou send a letter to Dianne Feinstein the next thing you know\nWell no no no that you sent find signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain who probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he is not a woman which she is\nSo you're just you're a beach pay him a psychology professor whatever from California\nAnd you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying and their lawyers don't tells you that the committee's willing to fly out to California to interview you\nI I I Want I didn't know I I Know you would ... I I Will you I Would have welcomed view is my home if you\nHad ... I don't even think I buy this\nThey she didn't want them to come out there because she was going to go to Delaware to meet with McLean\nShe didn't want the committee seeing who she was meeting with\n\nThis whole thing required her to come to Washington for this to pull off she had to come to Washington\nSo we look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia collusion or why\nDon't we find a woman who happens to be helping balls the foreign defeat Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd his nomination to the Supreme Court with\nEvery Democrats saying within minutes of Kevin all being nominated they're going to oppose them\nWith every Democrats that they believe her even though she doesn't have any evidence in time magazine just\nPut her on the cover new covered time magazine was a ... gift occasion above board\nA lassie she's she's she's seen taking meals a it's pathetic\nThis whole thing is going to set up is my point and the people that set it up are the same people that have been running the sign was coups against Donald Trump\n\nAnd every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee knows everything I just told you but rather than it'd be a problem they're telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pulled this off\nIn their world they've made the American people really believe that this woman was minding your own business one day when she was Fifteen and this nominee to the court came and brutalized her\nAnd she's just a woman that teacher\nLikes children terrify me here [laughter]\n\nThat's what a master plan we pulled off we got everybody in this country thinking\nAdded summing it didn't happen did that we\nHave nothing to do with it when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why ... won't turn over any of the cycle or the therapy and the a polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at\nAnd the Republicans notice too but the power of the Democrats look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh\n\nThis democratic machine is a scary scary bunch Democrat machine includes the media and all of these psychological deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committed violence\nWe got one of them who has just been arrested for doc thing a bunch of Republican senators\nThese are this world now how do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive beaver network on line at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right on the money\nLegitimizing and signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dastardly and add a number of other things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he has not confirmed accord stays up for for a deadlock what the what the reason that matters is that in a way if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of left us in charge of those issues in her state there's this shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly\nBe in unison with me too movement\n[noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos\nWere taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have ... wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental ... there is a picture on standby 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally when Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nAre chatting with each other and Murkowski\nAs a pain to look on her face Feinstein looks like she is\nA picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand that she got a cornered she's got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the dental camp do you\nSee the pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the next question of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of die for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on his that'll came to be able to see these that's that close up as the same shot\nJust to close up of the previously televised photo is that right\nWell John here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully in Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\n\nI mean it's it's been a really pained look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what\nFor [noise] [noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here\nOther than the hearings and the way this has been going well I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back or one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so you could be right\nAh it it could be a romantic under load\nI certainly what's the old saw it's not for us to criticize who loves who and why\n[noise] so uh yeah it can be a ... bat lovers quarrel we don't know\nBut I've got to get these photos up the cocoa unless cocoa confined to Chicago couldn't find them and self or it may beat me the punch now the other [noise] breaking story [noise] that's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this is\n... it's actually Dianne Feinstein and Lisa Murkowski this picture was taking the day before balls the forward testified\nIt was taking a day before so that we can go Wednesday his picture was taken a day before ... and the cabin all testified so that kinda helps put the picture in a more contacts does it\nNot [noise] and now back to the phones to Houston this is Scott great to have you on the E R B network hello\nWe lost\nHim so Scott in Houston is gone and he was just one of my favorite towns a mark in Knoxville, Tennessee your next readings are Hi\nGood afternoon rush thank you so much for taking my call anytime\nOlder anytime\nLongtime listener and first time caller it's an honor to speak with you that um would like to discuss this Murkowski briefly with you um\nI Believe it was during the bill Gorsuch earrings batch Murkowski went to the administration I eat Trump\nAnd bargain her votes for exploration writes in Anwar\nAnd I worked up and Trudeau I Know what that's like the revenue that that feel brings to the state\nIs correct that's correct you're right I remember that you're exactly right and well I I think I Know where you're going this is a hell of a pay back\n[laughter] yeah well yeah that was certainly resistance is ... is is there a way to get the gotcha back on trial or why hasn't that card than play back to her to say what the stroke of the St panic at all go away\nUm you know just something that makes you go home the other\nQuite went went wait wait wait a minute the stroke of a saint pick what could go away\nWell if the stroke to the pen can but and are in place for the state\nOh oh you mean Trump couldn't cancel and war as pay back the Murkowski for going against capital\nYes sir it wouldn't do it\nOh okay I'm\nToo many people be hurt too many people be hurt by\nYour right but that that means a lot for her and her stay\nSo I don't know um\nThe other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately impeachment hearings which started against Trump\nBut it would most likely include Kavanaugh what does that did it for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nThat can play you mean to be impeached is well\nAbsolutely sir\nNo no no ... they wouldn't buy that much off um get rid of capital I'm getting back off the bench or install Trump's next nominees when the White House and twenty twenty\nNow I I in fact I think my guess is that they would go after capital first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings\nRefreshing everybody's minds go after ... heard juror rainy and sexual harassment not I mean serious serious things for which\nA conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capital then they add all the other things on Trump this is my guest that they would go after Kavanaugh first but the ... that Gorsuch they would leave alone that Gorsuch\nShift the balance of the court cabin on does\nRight after the rash it's all happening right here on TALK radio Ninety eight point free in Fifteen ten W.
