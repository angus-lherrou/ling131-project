{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "All right that's a that's a great question I'm In it and I'd love to talk about the the process and how it goes through and and I love the idea of people retiring early so if you can retire early and get out in and do what you love to do and not be trapped in the job that you don't like\nYou can do it and it just takes a little bit of planning it takes a lot of planning it takes finding the right people and takes looking at your numbers and you know we before the show started mark and I had sat down and talk to them we talked about nine different things you wanted to cover I think we've covered three so he's still [laughter]\nOther stuff that Governor but you know when it comes to our process and how it works yes you cannot call and just say some of your lifestyle maximize er which\nIf you're talking to your be your friends and neighbors and they say hey I'm going to get this lifestyle maximize or it may not make sense to them 'cause that's something we created it's customized and it's cost them to the person that comes in so when somebody calls and they set up an appointment and and and what happens is\nCaramel send out just a little bit of a homework sheet that it's two pages for us to help gather some information about you so you you feel that information out and you come in you sit down\nIn the first meeting in our our meeting process is typically three or four meetings so some people want to race through it and get it done I've discovered over the years that if you rushed the process typically a lot of questions come back later and then it creates uneasiness and security and I don't want to do that so I Want to make sure that\nWe set the expectation correctly everything is step by step and it's a process and what that means as you come in for the first meeting we sit down we talk about what some of your goals are what some of your aspirations are I'm going to ask you what you're trying to achieve and when you want to achieve it\nAnd so I often say there is an emotional side of that meeting and then there's a financial or if you know a a a number side of this so we're going to talk about some of the stuff you'd like to do what's important to you when you're trying to achieve but then we're also going to talk about where do you have some air assets I'm not going to look at your statements I'm going to ask you to bring them in just in case we go to the next step\nSo the next step is you know so let's say we get done with this hour meeting and we both mutually agreed that it makes sense to go to the next step\nAnd that is the only question you'll ever ask me or hear me ask you the question is going to be what would you like me to do next and that's it so this is not a sales job this is not very upset and you're going to get trapped in my office you never going to leave no\nIt's an interview I'm interviewing you and you're interviewing me and if it makes sense to after that first hour to go to the next step then we'd go on if it doesn't we part ways knowing that we had a nice cup of coffee we enjoyed our camaraderie we enjoyed helping in talking to each other but that's all that it was and that is a ... okay\nBut if you say I want to go to the next step\nYou still do write us a check you still don't spend any money and what we do is we start to lay out our lifestyle maximize and this is where I Will take a look and I'll say okay\nLet's look at five key areas so let's make sure we talk about again goals and dreams but we also want to do this is me now taking all of your ah information to some of your statements\nAnd we do a thorough look at where everything is so without getting too deep into thick into the weeds basically what we're going to do is we're going to evaluate\nWhere everything is what are some of the pitfalls what are some of the things you're doing well\nAnd it it becomes a blueprint for the lifestyle maximize or this this next meeting is like the foundation\nOf what are the things that we want to achieve what's working and what's not working you come back in for another meeting this one is busy again no charge doesn't cost you a thing as long as we're both feel uncomfortable moving down the road we're on our way\nSo in the second leading takes about an hour I'm just going to lay out what I discovered very very educational\nKnow John I go back to my buddy that I was talking about that had unexpectedly\nHad six bypass surgery and then two days later he's got a nine hour spinal cord surgery and it's a long road there's no question but I can guarantee you that my buddy did not care how the heart surgeon was doing the surgery he\nWanted to know did he do the surgery and well and then when he went to the spinal cord surgeon obviously hey I Want to be able to walk again what in the world happened\nIt's crazy it I'm going through this but I'm trusting that you're going to do what is in my best interest that is what how you operate in the financial world Europe do share which means morally legally ethically obligated to do what is your client's best interest and\nI think that's really important as well because it's a two way street you know if I'm Talking to you about my retirement I'm the c._e._o. because it's my money is my retirement you're the CFO the chief financial officer you do this every day you understand\nWhat decisions are good and water ... maybe might be a little riskier and so it's about using your experience to help me come up with a plan\nFor me and my retirement\nYeah and then make sure 'cause people really what they want to know mark as they want to know okay\nCan I really trust John can I really have you know they can these goals really come true in we lay out in ... everything so it will lay it out and show everybody how it's going to happen with the probability is you know your success rate some of the things we have to be aware of\nAnd what happens after these meetings you know and and then after we implement everything I Want to stress also it doesn't and\nSo this is not like we're doing this once and then I'll send you on your way and I'll see you later now we're starting to begin a beautiful relationship\nAnd it won't happen just like any other relationship that you've been involved in it doesn't happen overnight it takes time\nYou know small steps over the course of a long period of time and then pretty soon you've got a great relationship and you know we put together a lot a lot of different things that we do throughout the year to help foster that relationship because\nMy goal is to a first of all make sure that you could live below if you want to live\nSecondly I Want to create a community of hundreds successful people a hundred people who have you know a figure it out or started to look at what's important to them\nAnd then I Want to bring those people together throughout the year at different events in different dinners and we do fun functions and we'll do a\nYou know sometimes we'll do charity events together sometimes we'll do a you know small trip together sometimes ... will have dinner together will do educational presentations to make sure you always know what's happening but I Want you to come together and meet my other people I'm very very protective of my people\nAnd the culture and when I talk about my culture I'm Talking about creating a great environment of great people and helping them discover what they wanted to do introduce you to each other and you guys were created a great community and and have\nNetwork of folks that used to be your work environment but it is now your retirement environment and instead of going to work and punching the clock you're going to do and great stuff whether you're camp and you're traveling you're going to grandkids ball games you're seeing the kids of the grandkids [laughter] you're doing the stuff that you love to do and that's what creates a great life\nIt's not going to happen by accident it happens on purpose\nIt happens but you take him to step in saying I'm going to call six one five six five six zero zero nine nine I'm going to take the first step I don't know if I'm going to take the second step\nBut I'm going to take the first step and make that phone call [laughter] so when you call will set up a time it'll be as market mentioned when we started the show in case you're just joining us he\nCalled it a fireside chat [laughter] but\nI Will be dressed I won't have a tie on but I Will be dressed so [laughter] I don't work [laughter] 'cause I ... I don't think you'd have to\nBut that's a different story [laughter] anyhow\nIt's going to be a very comfortable easy conversation we're going to figure out what's important to you I'll share with you our process\nIf it makes sense we go to the second step if it doesn't [noise]\nThat's all we invested so again the phone number six one five six five six zero zero nine nine\nOur goal for you to help you create the life you want to live [noise] single copy of your world\nGo half golden we don't have to be trapped in this box or and what America thinks that we should do we can go do what you want to do we just have to have a plan to get to have the right tools we've got to have\nExpert coach and we've got a crew and make a great [noise]\nSix one five six five six zero zero nine nine no ... no pressure might be the most important phone call you make six one five six five six zero zero nine nine we appreciate you spending time with us today on retire sit and we hope you'll tune in next week for more\nRetirement inside with Jon Benet Jon Davis\nAnd associate [noise]\nInvestment advisory services offered only by duly registered individuals through a wealth management El Al see a

insurance and investment products investing involves risque including the potential loss of principle\nAny references to safety security or guaranteed lifetime income generally referred to fix the insurance products never\n\nProminently the wanting an electrical broadcast better he's talk radio not only three I'll tell you I have to be do ten Fifteen to end up\nWith Joe ... a deadly mass shooting at Pittsburgh's tree of life synagogue hissing is very bad inside there are ... there are multiple fatalities\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road that CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let and it's the wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories on how the blue wave may not happen hip hid it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure [noise]\nThat was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it maybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff\nTalk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the border and how Trump didn't all white the narrative and didn't want to laugh so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared that when\nEver the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to I don't doubt\nIs the right where would they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance to Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in\nTransportation but there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people\nWho all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decide to start walking to a thousand miles we don't\nSee pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it I mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly thing but I mean we don't see how this is being handled\nWe don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams that what the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with ...\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border may cause they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those of you in a real Lyndon that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten\nThousand [noise] and then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan that we are just hearing about\nFox News ... ... S P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThey're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled the ranks with several people who've already been to Fort into caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the move again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of ...

is the Fox news alert on Debbie handling police say there are multiple fatalities in a shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for police officers were injured\nWhile we have is one subject in custody from the scene whether or not there's all these investigations yeah we have to look into every imaginable fact to find out if there is any one else has been involved\nWent to his

being mailed a process of the country\nEisenberg spoke to Katie Katie Pittsburgh Israel expressing shocking concerned this is Fox News [noise]\nRaasch Hannity on Fox News talk radio tidy eight point three and dean can\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review and we're back great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new week a broadcast excellence here and eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to [noise] one more with Louis ... he is from\nTexas He's on with the bill hammer and ... this morning bill ... says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply conservative violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the Caribbean by the\nWay the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh oh here's one\nFrom NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes\nLast night at thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pump pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the state\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything\nNegative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who won that right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake watch cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never did push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president\nWent on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're criminals one of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\nI think it's uh\nClassic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest for being driven solely by emotion\nGovern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a masked a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever we\nMay as well not have a border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing may as well just a race to the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement\nTo the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\n\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost\nAs an entitlement we had a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this and frankly\nI don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't been here for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nParticle brother thing the thing and say well standing up to nine percent off and more the is now\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN playing an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get\nKilled because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution and governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and it may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and left to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communist thank God is trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all of it on good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just the border if they\nBomb rushed to the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own he needs to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on\nOh I'm a whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a whole big dangerous situation but it isn't a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get away with it comes

morning I was listening to NPR and Steve hey a reference\nTo the mob but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a\nPersonality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order John's into ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to see mark they use what whatever it is to them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people but it's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nBut there's you know thousands of people on the line would only couldn't even see the end of it people waiting goes back\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this news\nThat NPR is a great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\n[noise] that you got for we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad connection here uh\nAbout the only time I registered NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've set\nUp for the audience and and then happened\nIs why I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three wait\nA minute but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people we're\nBeing led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn\nPoverty and or ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings they just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now when we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an S. obese grew Trump Trump simpler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody's thing or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways discussed\nBe helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of\nWhat's this guy's Jorge ... Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it Univision right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it\nI don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking\nPast him he's not looking at them behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then they're decent people and all they want\nLife and we as Americans we owe it to these people are what's up man that's all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how to work and this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching\nHim that these are\n... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch\nIn these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain

vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled\nDown on by the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in groups to her five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense of ... because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta\nPut yourselves in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times how Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their wits

Evans that in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics\nAnd analyzing if not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half said what you give them a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look saddens anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five states plenty of of that so it's two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races the G O P can hold the house [noise] so all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that

political opponents right now and Obama certainly isn't\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger their wife or their mirror here's not say that just it's just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is [noise] uh we'll see we'll let time\nOn the phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia I've been listening there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very\nMuch Russia you know it's a you talked about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh\nWe have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information out there for the masses of pain you know quite being there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that\nCame out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\n\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do this is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in

nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them is
