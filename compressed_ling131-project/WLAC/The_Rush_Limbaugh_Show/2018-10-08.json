Democratic party got that has become the Democratic party I firmly believe and I said this Friday\nAnd even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\nThere is\nNot a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp of approval\nOf winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained bases district and states their enclaves which is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal democratic presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America they have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it\nBut particularly its in its relevance its power and it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains\nIn one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion\nThe American people haven't decided that that was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey\nCannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intend to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these\nYears if Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they routinely\nSoft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as as a case of a Alexandria or gift you could pass who want to see on display in a left his district in New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust\nUnfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and besides you they're sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey tried to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats\nFirmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant gap in blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge

show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\n\nQuestion if the devastating to me than if white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products more power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate means do ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be

Kennedy any number of of ah Democrats\nThat you can point out yeah they've they've had their sacrificial lambs like Harvey Weinstein but they don't get rid of too many actual elected political people unless they are\nConvinced that getting rid of them and going to hurt them but they stand by the ones that they think they need But Kevin I was not even about sexual assault folks that was just the uh the hook that was just the train they decided to ride\nTo the railing the nomination anyway Derek and hazel in Pennsylvania you are up right to habeas are high\nA rush to begin to your show you are you're out of rhetorical question about a dozen Democrats really believe in this this new tactics with mom\nAnd I mean the Democrats learning surgeons they become a political insurgency and says you know when they started to feed it they just change tactics\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate argued that someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot\nWho has put ... on the final Republican\nUh ... true true but\nMaybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get an halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that is going to be turned off by it\nAnd want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nBlue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get a get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my saying and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but\nThat's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this it ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone\nThe Republicans aren't not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case for\nDemocrats think they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think\nThat they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout\nThere is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied no I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event hadn't happened and what twenty nine days left it it happened\nA true yeah when I'm when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this is going to be so old by the end I actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle\nUm\nNow I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot main theme this river passion\nFor long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's

crazy story but\nAnyway with a with a capital hearing what so sinister and ironic and all this is if\nYou remember back to Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against him in the early days\nOf not not out early but we are\nFor the accusations with him on the media Saturday Night live or every talk show on the news outlets they totally destroy these when they found the books that made fun of white\nTheir ... their stories a fake discredit them they questioned the motives on what Dr Ford where are you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have victims remember in
