things for a while trying to figure out what happened and then you'll get into the oh well this is an important thing about forty minutes and be able to refocus on what what I mean really I mean I'm going to Tampa\nNot for the show go for ... oh really [laughter]\nAnd yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by media says is just being done ... upset Trump's base that the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you're go vote it's again\nA classic expression\nOr illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains supportive of\nDonald Trump but that will get to more details that I ... back to my little test so I ran out of these people at the event last night it's going to be\nA red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of\nThem are committee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power reelection\nPower certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways loses seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the ... are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now\nI mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign resigning and members of Congress retiring maybe they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake\nThey're not going to stay at home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um to what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that\nNight interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty Eighteen congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to\nOffice and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Lynn Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great\nBook grading the presidential election in two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era\nThat I called the conservative here a long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn uh in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained opt in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading pill movements\nAnd the great awakening movement and he goes on\nTo describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nFill a movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case\nOr in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive\nBuys with like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations uh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats in the media think it is a problem\n[noise]\nThere's talk all over ... that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow\nStomach Trump chunks of phone I don't I don't want to be part of the products they split the scene and they're\nReplaced by a ... and Trump supporters so that could end up being a net positive okay when we

I I have at times I've marveled that this country is held together the way it has for many years as it has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept election results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen Russia's this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising am haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things\nThat have nothing in common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm\nIn junior high intramural football in softball that nobody won\nThat there were no outs in baseball you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play\nThere were no losers there were no winners outcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down\nWe're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case was losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child like snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump presidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one is not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good and when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

bother me upset about the local news or a local leaders were blaming us that people have Pittsburgh for the shooting that happened at ten o'clock\n[noise] they they were on\nThe local leaders are saying that we must come together and stuck to hey we must stop the violence we stopped\nAnd isn't that enter this is a great observation you are making this is classic you have one guy who's responsible for this he's mentally not write clearly off balance it does what he does\nAnd now all of you in Pittsburgh everybody we must come together we as do everybody living their lives cause this

better\nGlenn Beck weekday morning today on TALK radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen than doubled he went back to the phones we go this\nIs Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get rash I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... it it it ... your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they team sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few few years later and you can find that\nIn a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made this why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did\nBut the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent\nThe fourteenth amendment was never intended to confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten looking first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been a people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nThey use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all sneak to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this will be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that\nSo two calls to great points the the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed for the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe're talking about we were talking about the same thing that we have in this country for a uh companies that would like to locate in inner cities are poor areas they get a tax break for doing that\nWas part of the Trump tax cut pretty smart idea I thought why not do that in Central America they wouldn't be maybe the United nations could finally do something useful and subsidized companies who want to locate there and hire people to do that kind of work\nWhat you're talking about the caravan you'd think that what you're going to stop illegal

capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt

Bengali and I am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own\nI'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in the presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that\nAnd the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his motors is what's largely doing them in they never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but you know we're not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh dad or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never given any respect\nWhatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto it\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been ... can tell you how to think or tell you when did it go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives are out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that ...\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\nYours the reason that this is all going 'cause you have the stupidity of

with us about\nThank you so much for taking my call today rash and thank you for all you do you ...\nI just wanted to make a quick point that's a hard left and the media and the specially Hollywood and I think things have been engaging in gas lighting\nA the right would you ... would you define that I hear so many people to use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting and the nice combination sample is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this trial in the family to take care of all of that they can ... and what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about and they snare at then on especially when people aren't looking\nAnd then if that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make up its entire narrative and what they believe are ... that that person is an idiot they're not even now\nI'm not saying it all that every I'm liberal person is like this I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both sides but I think that a left elevate people like this and I think the right type it shut them up\nUm and that's really all you can do I mean you can't always control he's on your side but you can control the you elevate\nAnd I'm lying is perfectly fine if your gas lighting and especially the a dog whistle because you just imagine what the person says oh what was clearly that with race well they use the word the oh well don't you don't want to be at the dog with someone on the right uses that\nThey use the word the that's the kind of logic what\nWhat what what word B.

I'm suffering [noise]\nA joined the Sean Hannity days right after Russia saw happening right here on TALK radio and the boys three W A L lazy [noise]\n\nI'll let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller i._d. I lost her when she was how families will gas light\nA the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition of gas light\nA I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything they get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that\nThen of course as abnormal or what have you and that that that has been my point that's just a different way of saying that it\nIrritates the hell out of me too I watch the media but my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated\nIt was in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you\nI saw when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence is the governor the media\nWas out ranged and they began to report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude know thing that they do ... what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big gets are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you make a pizza when you when you make a pizza for why they were and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo me that typical Indiana make it\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive really an innocently she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting of that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump\nPeople rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred\nElectoral seats at federal state local level and\nThere's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana\nIs gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd uh and accepted and it's this arrogance and this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nA the synagogue shooting wallet he obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody\nThinks this is crucial for the media the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal\nWent increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition [noise]\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to 'em or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the electoral\nResults just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
