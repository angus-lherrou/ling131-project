{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Thanks for having me Robert\nYou've got to be pretty busy this time of year I Would think oh it's\nAlways a very busy time of year for anyone that works and government relations and politics yeah sad\nYeah no question about that and especially with what's going on with the midterms\nAs ... as we were in them is I just mentioned with the state of Tennessee there have been a whole lot of I guess in some senses I backing up it's not it's more what you said we're it's not a just twenty Eighteen where this is a busy\nYear and this is actually as the cycle goes of elections you're going to be busy regardless of what is your and you know who's in the White House who is being elected to Senate positions good gubernatorial positions whatever that may be a but this year seems a little different right you\nKnow I think that there's a lot at stake in this in this election yes and\nYou know one of the things that we are trying to do at the American Cancer Society cancer Action Network is to try to focus a lot on issues that are important to to Tennessee and in particular\nAnd I think that sometimes people can get distracted with the partisanship of races and said this is another way I think to engage voters I'm In the election process um by focusing on issues that are important to them\nYou know when you were on the show with us earlier this year we talked a I think it was specifically about the report that came out with with some new uh get the the new findings and\nUh and stats with regard to to cancer and and as it relates to Tennessee and say I mentioned this with literally every kind of a ... every type of gifts that we have we're the subject to some kind of a disease or an epidemic\nWhere it is something that sounds so broad as cancer there's like this natural aversion from the sense that you know of that other people or that you know you hear about these national statistics these huge numbers of people in other places\nAnd that's not the case and I you have numbers that really a lot of people that are listening to the show need to know about\nYes and yet he has one of those things that I think has touched probably everybody's lives in Tennessee and elsewhere and this here in Tennessee thirty six thousand seven hundred and sixty estimated new cancer diagnosis le Carr and fourteen thousand nine hundred estimated deaths will occur from cancer here in Tennessee\nNew cases where the number again\nNew cases thirty six thousand seven hundred and sixty estimated new cancer diagnoses and Tennessee\nAnd uh the month of October breast cancer awareness month than we had a guest on earlier this month and earlier in October mentioning the fact that you know she was you know I kind of tried to put myself in her position when she found out about\nA year she had breast cancer and I was thinking to myself and she was I think she was thirty six or seven when she got diagnosed fast and I was thinking to myself\nIt's you can ... there's always that version you think that it's something that happens to other people\nWould even take not another level if you're thinking somebody who's thirty six you don't want Sean anybody but you're typically thinking oh I Hope my mom doesn't get home my grandmother's ... she got that when she was thirty six and so there are so many ah folks that are listening to show that will\nBe able to relate to the fact that she probably hit someone\nIn their family in their lives at a time we made it wouldn't have expected right\nCorrect and that's the thing with cancer I can\nYou know your eye anybody can be diagnosed with it today I mean one of us might actually have cancer day we don't know and I think that that's why one of the issues that we work so closely with as an access to care and making sure that people have access to early screenings early detection and then if they do happen to have a cancer diagnosis\nThat they have insurance and that they're able to get the treatment that they need to be able to get\nThem without it and that's the I mean that's just part of the effort to you guys are are constantly working on a daily basis with regard to to you know not just the resources for people the access to those resources for people\nI mean there is another layer there are just making sure people realize that those things are available I got to think that that's the difficult as those other two elements I talked about\nYes I think you know if you get a cancer diagnosis and your family or for yourself\nYou know it is overwhelming the number of things that you have to do and trying to figure out what resources are available on the American Cancer Society has a great resource if you go to their cancer dot org they've got people that you can talk to you on the phone that will have to help walk you through what resources are available\nUm and they can try to help you navigate insurance and those kinds of things but the American Cancer Society cancer Action Network\nUm is are nonpartisan political arm of the American Cancer Society and so we really are advocating for policies that will move the needle on and make lives better for people that are affected by cancer\nSpeaking generally about that before we came on the air you were mentioning to me that uh as far as some of the funding that goes into the research and development for treatments for for for for for cancer a lot of it is just just publicly funded\nCorrect on the American Cancer Society does a great job of raising millions to their walks in ... but the number one ... of cancer research in America is the federal government they I'm literally spend billions of dollars every year\nOn funding cancer research through that NHRA the national Institute of health and the MCI Center at the national Cancer Institute and here in Tennessee we actually have two and NCI designated cancer centers and not to Vanderbilt and St gee it's\nThat's that's unique and as far as that kind of access and until I mean we're talking about some world renowned uh interests\nToday there as far as as far as this topic goes\nAbsolutely I'm In two thousand Seventeen funding research in Tennessee and and I H national entity that help state funding pretend to see with five hundred and eleven million dollars and and the title of National Cancer Institute state funding for Tennessee with over Ninety million dollars\nAnd that's money that's coming I mean in some ways directly into our economy which is wonderful and the economic impact in our state from that is a thousand and twenty seven jobs in Tennessee are supported by and I ate funding and it generated a hundred and thirty two billion new dollars on an economic activity from that\nI don't know if it's you know they're sort of a home field advantage but I Can't imagine that it hurts any one of the two senators in Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander happens to chair the Senate committee on health and that can be a bad thing right\nThat the help committee yes and he's you know always very open to our constituents anti hearing from us they recently and the budget that they passed several weeks ago it did include an increase in cancer research funding that we were thrilled with 'em\nAnd so he's always a tune to that and I think it it as you said it doesn't hurt that we have two of those um cancer instead he's right here in our state\nNo question about that if you're just joining us we're visiting with Emily Ogden she is the American Cancer Society cancer action networks Tennessee government relations director and she's been busy with a lot of\nProjects as we get closer to election day when we continue our conversation we're going to visit with family and talk to her about uh some of the specific information that she and her team have been working on to get\nTo the hands and in front of the eyes of of you know people who are going to be voting for some of our next leaders after this election cycle which means of course people that will have significant influence in what kind\nOf role in it or what kind of a priority\nCancer research is going to have as far as uh in the coming years so we'll talk to her about that when our conversation continues\nThat we probably need to put up a bb out on his ... he's on his way back from South Carolina Thursday so we we better be careful so well uh several years ago um you know I I was partner in the marketing company and\nI got to drive this big Yukon and hall am fairly decent sized trailer behind that probably an eight ten foot trailer and it was enjoyable time we spend a lot of time going back to back and forth of different colleges in the southeast\nAnd the hardest part of that whole tour that I did was driving the Yukon because of the blind spots there to be cars hiding that blondes by and I would even have nightmares night after I got done driving that thing in part to\nThinking oh my gosh I'm so happy I didn't run over somebody because you you would just there's just no way to really know what was there and so this morning I thought that'd be a good story kind of intro our topic this morning which is blind spots in retirement and so those are the things that\nBasically they robbed us of a good retirement that keep us from retiring well we've got a nice list we pulled together and want to start walking through those so probably ... ... ... paper you want to take some notes this morning and throughout the show if you have any questions or you want to schedule some time to come in and sit down with beaten John or the ...\n... to give us a call anytime six one five three nine five three thousand so John let's start out with our list and at the top is hidden fees are one of those major blind spots that people can have when they're looking at a retirement plan\nSo when we talk hidden fees how often do people come in that you meet with how often do they just simply not know the fees that they're paying\nWell it is is the large majority of the time I mean once in a while they'll come in and they'll have a fairly good idea of what their fees are but a lot of times they don't [noise] almost everyone understands their their management fees in terms of what they're paying their broker and that's something that definitely runs about one percent\nBut when we talk about fees were were not just talking about what you're paying your financial advisor or your broker we're talking about all of their internal cost inside of the funds which is which is an add on to whatever you're paying your advisor [noise] so I Would say it's very very seldom\nAnd then what I mean is there an average fee that people listening and go okay I can I Know if I'm above or below that phase or a magic number there\nWell I mean it really depends on your investment structures what you have but I I Would say that that the most people\nAre paying two to three times more than what they think are that's not always the case but in most cases they they are and you know when you when you think about ways that people can find out what their fees are that's a question I get asked a lot\nYou know how do they know what they are well if you have mutual funds for example and and they're certainly opportunity for that at certain points\nThere are expense ratio and there will be one fees and transaction cost and where you find those are in the perspective is now I think people should read the prospect of says there's good information in there but most people when you surveyed empty if you ask them what they do with her perspective as a they may glance at them but most of them ... or they'll throw them away\nAnd what I tell them is that if they just look at the feet area or section there's going to be a list of fees that they're paying and you've got to add\nThose up and so if they don't know uh what those are are they don't want to read the perspective says that's part of the analysis that we do for people\nIs we can take someone's portfolio what they currently have and we can tell them it's not sort of pie and this guy stuff for opinion It's MORNING Star Wars and things that are very credible we can actually take their portfolio we can loaded into morning star and it's going to tell us what they're paying an internal cost\nSo if for example just this last week I did one of these for a couple who thought they were paying one percent that was actually there their managers fee which is the average um so I don't think that's overstated or anything like that up but their internal costs of their phones were one point nine sex so they're actually paying close to three percent\nUm versus the one percent that they thought they were paying and so there are ways for you to find out how much you're paying and you need to because the thing about paying too much cheese is like a double edged sword if your return is eight percent and your feet structures three you're netting five\nWell if the market's down ten percent and not saying the market's going to go down ten per se\nAnd that feeds don't get wave and in the bad years so they add to the last so fees and taxes and now we're going to talk about taxes later in the show today those are I Believe fundamentally to the biggest the use of your portfolio performance having too much and fees not understanding it's a double edged sword and paying too much in taxes but\nYou can in fact know what your fee structure is and you should know what your body structure is very very important\nSo if you do find that out and so you read read through your your documentation that you get on a monthly basis and you read through that you find out what could someone do is there a way to negotiate or to alter those fees that they're they're being charged pain into well\nYeah you can look at even if the sectors that they're in for example are sectors you feel like are are are good places for them to be you can look for other similar performing funds that are at a lower cost or you can look at certain investments that have a better\nTax efficiency or structure for a couple so for example one of the other things again and not to get in his taxes what if you have a mutual fund was to turn over how many times is their internal trading going on in in in the fund\nThat you don't know about and so if you can have similar a return with a lower cost\nLower turnover fun if in fact mutual funds were you want to be in there are certainly many other options then you're probably going to keep more money in your pocket\nSo if if two sons were equal in terms of performance and one was one percent last year going to have a better return because you're paying less than ... and so it all connects it's all very very important to understand those\nThings and I I'd say an additional one percent back in your pocket is a is a big deal well you can go far with\nThat yeah so let's just calculate that for just a minute so one percent is not insignificant\nSo for example if if you have a half a million dollars that's five thousand dollars a year\nIf you have a million dollars that's ten thousand dollars a year that would be fifty thousand dollars over you know the next five years it'd be a hundred thousand dollars over a ten year time period and so\nThe numbers really start to add up so if you have a million dollars that you could say one percent on and keep a hundred thousand dollars more in your pocket over the next ten years well could you do with that what would you do with that\nAnd so the numbers do they are not insignificant and so one understand with the percentages and then I Want to understand how that applies to my family in my situation\nYou know that's good because a hundred thousand dollars could buy a lot of moustache shampoo favorites and get along a lot of shampoo for a stash All right well that's hidden fees let's move on into our second when John you've already looted to it but the or the second time blind spot in retirement we've got down as not having that forward looking tax point\nAnd a boy I'll tell you will get on this and start on this and we'll we'll wrap up a little bit more on the other side of the break because I'll tell you that this is a big topic and let me just intro this before we go to the break with this I I really believe that that there was a massive\nDifference between a tax preparer and attacks planner and attacks planners someone that has a forward looking tax plan that ... people a lot of times they what's what's the difference\nThe differences simple this uh you know someone that does your taxes is well intentioned doing a job for you to their job is to look at taxes you over the previous year and to see if there are things they can do\nTo save you some of those taxes so for example maybe make a contribution to an IRA or something like that [noise]\nA forward looking tax plan or a CPA if someone who says hey here's the environment today here's the opportunity not just for today but for the next five years in ten years and here's how we wanna we want to implement efficiencies tax efficiencies into your retirement and here's what I fundamentally believe I Believe in retirement that\nThis was a period of time people have more control their taxes but they literally do less planning that in any other point in their life but let me go back to what we started with when it comes to overcoming hidden fees you want to you want to holistic approach or a full service wealth planning from\nAnd that includes the whole picture it's it's well planning its tax planning it's a state planning this should involve the coordinate efforts of qualified financial advisors CPAs an estate planning

non five three thousand but they're going to do review your retirement plan with a financial advisor a CPA in in the state attorney all the same table\nAnd it's not only the most convenient way to set up your retirement planning but we believe is the most effective it's why Nashville finest retirees and pre retirees had been relying on beacon for their full service approach for over Eighteen years to call today six one five three non five three thousand when we return and\nWe're going to talk about more retirement blind spots and how to avoid them overcome them we'll be right back\nLet's see if

that you've got the right number or whatever that is you're never going to know everything else is just opinion it's just an advisor telling you well you can retire because I said you can retire\nI don't want to retire that way I Want to make sure that I Know the number that I have is a number that I Need to retire and be able to support\nMy lifestyle so if you ready for that change in plan are

their ah John as a an avid athlete or John max and is here with me this afternoon\nNow if you're just tuning in we're glad to have you joined us today show is brought to you by the folks making Capital Management\nWith offices in cool springs Brentwood mount Juliet and again drum roll what John is very excited about a new office coming soon to Murfreesboro now right there all the medical drive and the avenues just so they can now we can be more conveniently located far I'm struck friends up there\nSo today we're talking about retirement blind spots and we'd gone through several different things you talked about hidden fees not having affordable can tax plan not knowing your retirement number\nNot optimizing your Social Security income and we're ready for our fifth on the list and that is not factoring in longer life expectancy or simply outliving your retirement plan\nSo John I guess some people find themselves kind of may be living in the past where they they can remember their grandparents or their their parents that they put together maybe a five ten maybe a stretch Fifteen year retirement plan and that's simply won't do any more because we've got people on retirement there\nNeed to put together a plan of twenty thirty forty plus years mhm so when someone comes in how do you help them determine\nBasically how did they keep from outliving their retirement plan\nWell that's the number one concern of people in America today it's been a couple of years ago now but Wall Street journal had a poll\nWhere they they pulled the boomer generation and they said how many of you are highly confident that the plane you have today is going to get you know like to retirement but through retirement supporting your lifestyle that survey said was\nThat eighty three percent of the boomer generation that's a generational Seventy million strong retiring at about ten thousand a day in America they were not highly confident and the truth is that there's no reason for that because you can be highly confident\nThat you're going to be able to sustain your lifestyle and you know it's interesting part of it just begins with with education and preparing people for the fact that that they could be retired longer than they're working we have clients now that have been retired longer\nThan they were working and people are just living large you know Nashville's an amazing community the healthcare that we have here is phenomenal or the advancements and healthcare across the board people are healthy they're active here\nAnd you know none of us are promised tomorrow anything can happen\nBut we want to plan for a very long a retirement and we want to have a good retirement you know Social Security for example when it first started life expectancy is we're we're handful years seven or eight years and now people start Social Security is sixty two and they're still taking Social Security and their nineties which is one of the things if\nThis was some stress on the Social Security trust and and that's a whole other topic\nBut you you really need to plan for a very long retirement in particular\nIf you're a healthy couple and let's say you're in your mid sixties or some longevity studies that suggest that women in particular\nAre are going to live well into their nineties if they're relatively healthy and their their mid sixties\nAnd so but even for men you know I have a lot of men that will come in and see me they'll say well you know my father died at Seventy and I don't plan to live much longer than that you know and then they wake up one day and they're eighty or eighty four and they're still living independently and they're still\nYou know talking about working out I I have a client who works out every day and he's eighty three years old and and you know he would turn circles around me so people are just living longer\nAnd so this plays into how you want to make choices on everything that you may you know we talked already about Social Security but you know if the husband is the higher income earner\nYou a lot of times they'll look at Social Security choices for example or pension choices through their life expectancy but I encourage them if their wife is is healthy to look at things to their wife's life expectancy because statistically\nUs man you know I'm forty seven my wife has four days should kill me if she knew I was saying that on on the radio she's older she's rocking the cradle yeah but the reality is my wife is more than likely gonna far outlive me you know ... and your wife is going to far outlive you and so\nWhen I make choices on asked as I Want to make those based on life expectancy is I have a grandmother who died six years ago she was Ninety seven I have one remaining who lives independently\nWho is almost Ninety five years old so you've got a plan for a long life extract\nSudden as you know inflation you know and two dozen may change at one point nine percent and\nIt's been a tube one percent and two dozen sixteen into them Seventeen and\nThe forecast is around that two percent mark again for two dozen Nineteen and twenty twenty so I I can only assume that inflation certainly plays a major factor weren't looking at making sure we don't outlive are expecting say so how do you guys factored that in someone's\nRetirement plan I mean it's huge I mean is absolutely huge and the question I Would ask is do you have a written inflation plant because that's something we do for every one of our clients because you know if your standard of living and I'll just throw a number out there's five thousand dollars today I said that's not going to stay at five thousand dollars I mean just think about\nHow things have gone up just in the last ten years I mean ten years ago it was a gallon gas not what it is today how much how much was Milt ten years ago five years ago two years ago you know things go up over time\nAnd you know when you talk about roughly two percent\nInflation been one of the things I'd add to that is that's what the the fed tells us or the federal government tells us is inflation is around two percent and what they're talking about there and that is true\nIs core inflation but core inflation does does not include food and energy and so if you think about\nSomeone who is retired what're to the biggest line items to your budget while their food and energy you don't retire and stopped going to the grocery store fill in your car with gas when you travel or picked a grand kids up you know you don't stop heating your house in the winter ... and the summers of food and energy our", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beacon Retirement Strategies", "city": "Nashville", "day": "28"}
