{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Out of finding out what's causing these discrepancies in the therapies and trying to make a change\nAs we wrap up church Shawna I'll I meant when I started poking around on city health dashboard dot com and looking in Nashville\nThe site once again it's city health dashboard\nDot com you can find out all about as a part of Tennessee here and and the neighborhoods that are that you reside in and ... and ... ... votes for joining us this morning thanks so much for your time today\nSome Robert ... Tennessee radio network [noise]\n[noise] she will listen a little thing and then dropped by listening to him on a random thing we viability on TALK radio Ninety eight point three and Fifteen ten W. L. A. C.\nWeekend tuned into Tennessee matters\nI'm Robert want were often encouraged not to sweat the small stuff well easier said than done for some folks literally and figuratively and that's part of what we're talking about today with a guest\nWho is joining us on the phone from like near a dermatology in New York it's Dr Josh who was like how you doing this morning\nGood thanks so much for having me excited to be here\nThank you for making time for us to talk about primary actor Larry hyper hydro cyst what his ...\nYeah so it's a mouthful but that the primary actual Larry hyper hydro so it's a technical term for accepted under on sweating\nAnd this is a huge issue for millions of Americans estimated that up to ten million Americans are suffering from excessive under I'm sweating it's an equal opportunity we know that both men and women for equally and it even can affect children I'm starting as early as adolescence [noise]\nUm we know that sweating as an important part of a body functioning and and we swipe top maintain our core body temperature but in these patients they're making up to five times more ... than the average individual and that's much more than you need to keep her body temperature and check\nThis has got to be something that well I mean obviously it's listen a specialty for you but just as a general topic I got her imagine that there is a whole lot of just general I don't know if it's a shame is the right word that would be associated with the topic in general how much of that just I mean on the surface it doesn't sound like it's something that\nYou don't really bring it up a cocktail parties that kind of thing\nYeah so I think that there are some medical conditions that people are talking about this is one where people are really hiding there not discussing it with friends or family members [noise]\nEighty five percent of patients are embarrassed by um except the sweating as you can imagine and up to Seventy five percent of patients have a difficult time going out in public I have patients who were only wear black because they won't where light colored fabrics because you can feet wet and it's ...\nI'm not really so much of an issue for radio right but if you work in front of other people and your job involves public speaking for meetings\nYou can imagine that that except for sweating can be an issue there and even in your interpersonal relationships whether you're dating or you're out with friends if you're constantly checking your under arms or your clothing is is French with sweat\nUm it can be quite embarrassing\nCan you give us a sense of what if any trends there are that exists with regard to this this uh you said this problem I I don't know if there are\nRisk factors that are involved I don't know if there are certain elements to our everyday lives that may be contributing to an increase for a decrease of of this particular\nA syndrome but what what exactly do we know as far as the numbers and then what effects from\nIt so we know that that sweating as a part of everyday life to keep our core body temperature and check\n'em in response to the temperature you know the environment and in response to emotional syrup for these patients are excessively sweating totally independent of not related to any other medical conditions for any medications that they're on this is the primary issue and we don't understand why some people are suffering more than others\nUm but I think that the more we talk about it the more people will come forward and actually seek care rather than suffering alone\nAnd that's where I didn't know if there weren't any in the numbers that through the Pentagon how far studies go back whether it's something that has increased over years or whatever the case may be ... well we know anything like that is more\nSo I really don't have data there when I can tell you is that we know that up to fourteen million Americans\nSuffer from excessive sweating in general that may include the under arms but also the palms of hand the souls of the the the faith that ... throughout the body but about ten million Americans suffer specifically from except for sweating and the underarm area\nWhat have people been doing in the past\nTo to to treat the situation and and I understand there are some things that that may be a if people have tried to do some things in the past that I haven't worked maybe there are some more recent developments that could possibly be more effective\nYet so we traditionally treat 'em except for sweating with over the counter anti prospering than they were five locking wetness from reaching the surface of the skin and there are some devices and procedures in the office that can be used but now for the very first time we have a topical wife\nA topical um how will that hope to breakfast I'm an FDA approved to treat under I'm sweating\nUm as I mentioned before the ... it should be use 'em under the armed one daily one swipe her farm\nUm if you want them into scarred and you need to make sure that you wash your hands really well after applying it um and it in the grief is actually the amount of sweat\nUm that you produce so it's a really exciting time for people who are suffering make sure to visit the website for this drug you breakfast dot com that's so cute B. R. E. X. I. V. A. dot com and they have information on the drug itself\nAnd there is a resource for you to be able to locate a German soldier gets in your area to get a prescription for it\nCan you give us a sense of what the what the differences between that and what in anti per sprint might do uh I mean what would the effectiveness obviously it's one of those your mileage may very kind of things but just as application goes in and maybe just as the the actual product what he does differently\nSure so in some ways and not the products are used ones daily they're similar but anti perfect for instance I mentioned earlier to lock sweat\nFrom reaching the surface of the skin so they they blocked the wet and if it's like a road blocks the way that prescription drug works and again the only topical FDA approved prescription medication right now for this condition [noise] the way that it worked that it actually increases the amount of sweat that being produced in the area that it's applied\nSo I'm sort of like turning off the offer\nAs we wrap up here just in there and there again as I was kind of talking about at the top and it's got to be something that people he got to be difficult for them to\nTalk about let alone to seek you maybe you just this kind of a kind of treatment or consultation for something like that\nAs we can get a final ... from you what would you tell some of those folks if they're listening to us right now about how you doing courage them to to maybe do something about a situation that can be treated\n[noise] yeah if you're sweating more than you feel that you should be affecting your quality of life please know that this is a medical condition and it's not just a cosmetic issue there are things that we can do\nFor you and visited a board certified dermatologist for evaluation and you can ask about this brand new FDA approved once daily I'm topical costs calls cue breakfast um to help treat excessive underarm\nSweater Dr Joshua joining us this morning thanks so much for your time\nGreat thanks so much for having me I'm Robert one and this is the tendency radio network [noise]\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W. I. lazy and that's\nAbout all the time we happen to this week's edition of Tennessee\nThoughts are questions about in this week's show follow me on Twitter Roberts\nThat Robin you have this week yeah Michael ... from owning bipolar job seekers Lee we Univision Tommy ... from city health dashboard and Dr Joshua was mythology in operations on the tendency radio network\nChris Romer in Amy men and thank you for joining us this week you'll do it again next weekend we talk more\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the claim well Christie lousy Ford testified in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's ... incredible credible witness credible which is actually untrue she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple due to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was at the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has everybody\nCorroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she itself you need some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point of delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then to report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was a quarter as they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk or you've got to remember anything and then she's told\nBrett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it to which Kavanaugh said no never done anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said what spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quite loads\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them and I say in eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties where there's not a full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times in history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter too lazy that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to ... didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because in the clubs all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he grow up to a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold\nThan it is then he's innocent nothing any of these women has said\nOr the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nutty from outer space story she's giving and of course the Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else's named and the FBI spent five days six days\nInterviewing many more people in Canada who didn't come to ... offer of evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter\nRead your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls their dock sing people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses it say a violent crew of idiots\nThat are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us Melissa mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapist serial rapist you're in a better rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way\nThey are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China come on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen between now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska\nWho is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today and she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now what what\nOr somewhat safe way way way and\nOthers have said flake flakes wake and\nI'm On now reveal your dance on a Saturday let's go\nYou're welcome ... Amy than\nFarming than before we says for I agree\nDo your duty mom regular job they may\nMay they may harmony for you don't need to\nDo your duty\nTrying\nIs actually right stuck in the elevator with girls\nDemanded it happened to be there to\nAh they make\nHe\nWas a ...\nYou are saying here's a snake\nStill like the guy we both um\nThat bag\nAh they ...\nRight it's hot today is my wife no looting\nAh thing back back\nDo your duty\nHot today a little uh ...\nFor your flake flakes lake I go to just go at play play but I'm going to call it 'cause my ...

I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of the committee I Will clear there's room and be given interrupting than it would ... with proper protocol is but there were breaking it on purpose because they really thought\nThey're putting on the show which somehow waiting for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nIn your bag by bag I'm like oh really you're at it uh\nI think the Democrats are definitely oh now they're [laughter] they're getting worse every month I guess getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down it's just it's very frustrating\nOn the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that pointing fingers at a man like feeling guilty\nAnd you got to live for the shot if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously had a lot of class he's a very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice he he he gets to a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty of due process in this country now and understand that that's what makes this country great everybody gets a fair trial", "show_name": "Beacon Retirement Strategies", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "07"}
