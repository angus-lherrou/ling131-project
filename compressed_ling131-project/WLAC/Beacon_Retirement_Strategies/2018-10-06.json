{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "Whole life companies don't sell cheap term insurance\nRight guy I contacted Vander ... last week\nWhen you get your term insurance in place you can just cancel with the company directly if you want to call the agent you can call them I don't care but you know their job is to save the say you'll\nLose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself and so there is no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve any ...\nI wasn't going to have it I was just going to be under grant can't no matter what you know but I didn't know there are certain steps now that if I did take I Would lose out on getting them the most out of the cash value whatever's there\nNo there's no difference at all all you do is you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't good customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know asked them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value what's the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow Walker ignore your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancer on the credit card you got to argue with him to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to sign a piece of paper forget them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've\nBeen on I wake up and down probably seven months ago on ... on a really challenging time because we have a childhood in college that can you hear that we need to pay for and that's how I have here in case there's where I can do to extend that they can hide it and not far\nFrom ... to try to figure out in the\nHat and before they can stay tribute full fare chain pounce on or taking out a scandal while you're on the fact that I get something to make sure that we're doing the right thing since I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to work and it was nearly every state in and give them a lot of it just fine\nI'm Sorry you did the ... the ... century you lost your job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\n\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got to do so what a masters as you're in the middle of the storm we got a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] I'm not going to total when I have to pay twenty scary by coming out here and I have to pay about eight thousand\nOkay and do you have eight thousand persuade them okay\nWell I mean even if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\nThan you have\nThe money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout five and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband and I kept falling day okay and what did you use to do 'em in software support and how long have you been laid off on down Saturday Night while\nNot but in Berlin somewhat worth yeah definitely at that ... thing and I'm\nI'm generally on something in that period of time in that field\nThat may still that's working on it working on it\nOkay 'cause I I Know in other words the good news is you're in a an active technology type position that ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely\nYou're not you're in an active market metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester or two and get a job pays eight thousand\nOn that too but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life\nOut of your husband's income and that's what you push through\nBut I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money I don't teach people to borrow money at them borrow money some urgency don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid\nAnd greed and fear are a good way to lose your butt with money for sure\nSo don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force have for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind of game I think I might call sure my hand and and I are brand new ... in August ... can kind of northern California and in our new we I had a guy on an coming here as a para educator\nAnd kind of a school district has been good not and so our goal like cash and we had to\nHave that and and ... and that got into anyway anyway ... along with ... eternity we now have to pay well we can align against it about four years ago and\nHad eight thousand dollars you're meaning like retiring\nAnd giving him the kind of make campaigning I think the dollar and then I hear a finished paying off a ... dollar he retired from there well he lack a company now all day long hearing uh twenty eight year if if the wine\nAnd cocaine we cannot drink higher\nNow that doesn't matter on this you're you're a four O. one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do\nUnfold sorrows regulations\nI think is very sad because they're not going to say that the remainder that he can continue to make payments\nAre just I don't want to do and I ... I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're ... in front of regulation little ones with the with what the companies are saying that's fine but I don't think that's so\nModel I don't have anybody that help and that's what the what is called we called the four one K. people\nI Know you need to call it ... professional the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and your text and Pena launched\nSo that's my understanding of the real okay so\nWhat I was under the impression was originally when we left that we weren't going to be able to pay it back that's what we thought drawn based on what they told us that we were going to take that penalty and the taxes on it while I'm back when we ain't got\nSettled in ... he's a letter saying that they all say categorized and I are retired I don't care because they don't get to decide what Irish tax regulations are and they don't get to make them off and\nSo what their litter so it doesn't matter you need to get some professional ... go to Dave Ramsey dot com click on it you'll be for taxes\nAnd sit down with somebody to help you talked to several of those are the rams are showing the books will be with you before you know it in the meantime remember all the financial peace in that store won't directly with the principal came [noise]\nThe good news is is the instant before they go in his shoe or you could file and they'd never get it done\nSo we're still nothing on fire were ways away from having to worry about their so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at that job and find out you had that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in my ear might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you've been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through is you feel the tyranny\nThe tyrant in your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly\nAnd out of ... out of almost a desperation an emotional desperation I my wrong or am I reading your mail\nHere correct\nOkay and so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate because you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing and flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff naturally now how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and ...\nGood and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't like that yeah\nThat's probably about ... three thousand kinds\nThat is not bankrupt up All right okay and do you have any IRS that\nNo just um foreclosure on the house\nOkay and what type of a home loan did you have F ha VA or conventional\nUm I ... well it started off fresh Fannie Mae but then it got [noise] um so then when he finance and I'm at this point I don't even remember what kind of why\nIt's possible that they're not going to trace you at all\n\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar for a thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nI'm arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars\nAnd the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to you and your wages and you just begin to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy\nTo see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again\nRight starts at all new\nBut if you can just clear these things up they drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by garnishment but to day I Would not file based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet\nHappened the man is not real you got away from him right you're going to be okay\nIf I Am able to start paying off but that we will be back he go from a smaller step largest where\nI Would catch them smallest the largest and I would call the smallest one in subtle with them\nFor ten to twenty cents on the dollar and then I Would set of what the next one for ten to twenty cents on the dollar ... meanwhile I'd get my student loans going on a basic payment plan that's all after you're back to work and feeding your kids and have lights and water and my life to live and all that which is infinitely more important than anything we're talking about\nRight\nNow have you been through financial ... virtually learning how to handle money you\nKnow I read said cut all money make over to the library but I Want to go through the glass is my guest
