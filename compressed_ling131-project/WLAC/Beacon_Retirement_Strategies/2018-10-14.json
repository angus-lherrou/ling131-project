story memory on radio not going\nTo be deemed ten double ...\nOn the\nWitness you tuned into Tennessee matters I'm Robert blonde today we're talking about women living with medicine static breast cancer and this was the topic ... it's not one that's a very comfortable topic it's not one that\nPeople like to be talking about and you're usually addressing it when it's something that's directly affecting you\nTo talk about that in more detail a couple of guests who are joining us on the phone this morning one is in the ... in on college eating in Texas and That's Dr Joyce oh Shauna the doctor who shot and see good\nMorning to you than wine Robert ...\nAs I mentioned this is not a comfortable topic for a lot of people but certainly we're talking about it because we want to make people aware of what they should know about it\nYes absolutely it is at issue when black Catherine God unfortunately on Connelly but it happened and spread to other vital organs like them long brain liver et cetera and that's it asked if I met a static\nBreast cancer and younger women had a more aggressive form of it unfortunately as how it is here to attest to unfortunately yeah\nShe's our second guest joining us on the phone here and how good tourists who is joining us good morning to you ... how are you I'm good morning this is something\nI was just reading a little bit about your ah your story and how you found out about this at a relatively\nA early age and we're talking about you you were thirty five years old when you found out about this I mean I don't want to like a you know did speak more you are trying to read your mind I'm just thinking about when I was thirty five years old and thinking about what breast cancer meant\nIt's something that I didn't like when I was hoping it was something that my mom didn't get more something that older women didn't lose your mind said before this had happened to you\nIt's tacky I knew nothing about breast cancer pretty much can like on I have no carrying my family so it's a like that pain like my world was turned upside down that I had to learn what cancer widespread cancer [noise]\nUm yes that feeling that I feel for these that I'm thirty five ... yes exactly what you said I've not fair that would be my radar idol\nHe's not make sense to me and that's where I mean obviously you had to learn about this\nUh I mean you you took the crash course on he had to find out everything you needed to know about ... ... ... what were your initial diagnoses who did you talk to first ones who just your your your general practitioner can you just kind of walk us through to where you are right now\nYes I um I mean we're just ... and they say more aggressive so I'm just getting into you know breast cancer it's hot here um\nI never felt that long for anything in my ... uh it was home till my arm pitfall got like the cancer had already spread ... founder my arms that I I I thought it was there was something we're here there's something wrong so I went to my general practitioner\nOn a on from there you know by the end of the test and on and that new breast cancer was called for but um yeah say\nFor younger woman it's a very aggressive they say is I Believe that yes if I'm not sure what else to tell\nYou know I'm sure it's very confusing just even like walking through it and you've already been through it all so that totally makes sense Doctorow shown to see what she's describing and the way that you've already told us about what this particular type of breast cancer is like\nWhat I'm hearing is that you you you mentioned it's it's a very aggressive type it happens to to younger women how a ... a key piece is this particular type\nSo there are several different types of cancer that's metastasized\nYoung women get the most common is fed like estrogen female hormone and that's one of the reasons it's more aggressive and young women because they had very strong reason they're mainstream cetera\nThat we need to turn off the afternoon and common variety thankfully there are new treatments that really are improving the outcome of women that are responses and most importantly much longer control and disease on\nOne new approval for young women with metastasized breast cancer is a pill called ...\nWhich is ... ... a ally and it\nStopped selling division of the breast cancer at the full pay for six and haven't turned those are the protein and the drive to campus how\nCan we divide and the violence because Kelly ... stopping the African production by the ovaries really break through therapy for young women with breast cancer\nCan you give us a sense I my understanding this is something that was just to prove this year obviously in the case of ... we're talking about four years ago when she was diagnosed when she part of this study to get this approved ... she ... somebody who would qualify for this now where she on the timeline of the development of this particular product\nWell this particular product is Kelly I'm unfortunately it's not an option for I have this kind of breast cancer thankfully for hours and there was a great ... I'm new drug development going on with her kind of breast cancer so it's a tremendous amount of work going on right across\nThe board but this is Kelly from breast cancer that are fed by the afternoon on it for both older one in ... and ... would come with another held together on this thing so that\nWould that's convenient for patients on hold a from Mara let's get in with some are in the case Kelly and turning off the race\nAs well tolerated in therapy you know some decrease in the white fun cell count a little bit of an increase in their means a little bit of Fifteen but honestly quite quite well tolerated which I Know it's so important for for went in with how the or living with the static breast cancer\nAnd that's obviously something that ... you had to factor in as soon as you were diagnosed going through your treatments\nAnd figuring out what's next not just as far as the treatment goes with just your life in general I mean there's there's so many things that you had now we're just interrupted and trying to figure out where to go from there is a that's a whole Jones onto itself let alone the treatment I Would think\nYes yes and and that's one where they could put it in a new treatment and with our doctors are that the first thing we ask what are the side effects of this option and sometimes we base our fish and don't want to on drugs to go next base on this side effects on what to expect so when you have ... states that are\nThat harsh that led to continue living your life that's norm off off the wall that that's if they feel\nThat's an important message I think from El good talking to our audiences in and folks that might be\nGoing through their own battles with in this particular challenge and talking about breast cancer before we wrap up our final word doctor who shone a C. too to some of the folks in our audience about that particular message in where they might be able to go online to find out more for themselves\nBecause it is a new opportunity for the for the pre menopausal women to kiss Sally it hadn't been at over ... percent\nOf all it all went in for about a year and a half but there's a website just Kelly dot com KF to a L. I. dot com for more information [noise]\nThey'll get tourism Dr Joyce ... joining us this morning thank you\nThank you very much Robert\nI'm Robert won the Tennessee radio network\nTalk radio Ninety eight point three Fifteen ten W. I. lazy and that's about all the time\nShe's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and it's like now giving her greens if he hears the odd\nThing and the whole thing is a bit more on those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or where you see me during the week on Newsmax\nWhen you turn it on and somebody has presented as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist honor all have a an actor honor and I'll say this is an activity you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son ...\nYou'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person on some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the first is getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking you represent getting paid too\nBut they keep on presenting it wasn't a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her\n\nAnd address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today\nI'm I'm confused why are we doing a story and listen to the lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is for some\nReason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy for and what have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care white illicit model thinks why she's not an expert\n\nI talked about this by talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes and people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see on the tube or or on the big screen\nFor a long time and we stayed ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence\nOn them Alyssa Milano is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYet the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out of your like a like me to buy into this far left wing garbage\nListen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't up their side they think she does but she doesn't\nWhen was the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb this the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing or look at her blindly\nSaying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually at this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\n\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or your your read it on some of these current events websites there's Alyssa Milano\nAnd they never ever ever never say why we should believe or you should believe a list of all I'll be cause fill in the black\nJust doesn't happen oh another trending thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ...\nRobbery ... of course the Confederate general who lost and had to surrender to the U.S rent\n\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ... period and their story and of course\nThat's the only period and the story of your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert ... on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\n\nThe media knows that but they also know you don't know that you\nDon't know that the president said it that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Roberts Lee are they telling the truth yes\n\nBut it's also a sin of omission or lie of omission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd than they are fantastic it's worth is the best thing ever going to go to my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar [noise]\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good then he kicked vis guys asking this guy was really good\nThat was the context\nBut white tell the truth when you can lie and incorrect later and by the way on social media when you lie in a year your legacy media tens of thousands of a retreats likes what you're correct it\nA few hundred that's the way it goes to this day and age\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero bottom of this hour is going to be former Governor Sarah Palin\nThe great state of Alaska what a great conversation I had with her and how we ended up\nConnecting on my show the Joe ... show Monday through friday but it's kind of mind boggling if you want to see the live video feed just shot by Joe ...

your own for the ride or there's a lot going on this past week\nI was able to connect with us or a payload yes that Sarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee for vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened\nAnd in our show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and are you hoping you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream we watch it because the scenery behind or is beautiful in Alaska but do lose Jones boys and girls who served village there how are ya\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday and the people know I was actually and this was unfolding on me or love you are listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening just want to see a good point they should ... you've got a\nFamous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said he's really me I promise [laughter]\n\nHad gone back and forth and I needed it oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and we get along so thank you for doing that and know it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening [laughter] I don't have that much I Know what I'm trying to verify it me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from sure appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone ... face time you must you settle this once and fro ing and very good as we gotta thank you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone work by that time out of the vehicle and we're all press a button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the button you took my time and very ... her let's say that's her that's [laughter] I Know you've got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDid the people of Alaska except that excuse\n[noise] no and go back even further\nWriting campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank workout after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on ... and I ran against him in defeated him for it that's how we got and that's how he said they didn't necessarily 'cause man once you're in and you have these special interest from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough\nTime to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good matter\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested as an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska you for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its grass having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate but you know you are you like wasn't up and I circuit court of appeals that I'll I'll repeat that in the second it's us or opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska\nAnd just a great all run person so you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going right at my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you so and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every really would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nExactly right and Joe I'm breath because nobody else was talking about that but share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out\nRight now about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskan because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why\nWe don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous another thing is that the\nTrump President Trump saw the light and is
