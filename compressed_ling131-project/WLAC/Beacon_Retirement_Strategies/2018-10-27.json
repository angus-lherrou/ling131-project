{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "You can do it and it just takes a little bit of planning it takes a lot of planning it takes finding the right people and takes looking at your numbers and you know we before the show started Americanized sat down and talk to them we talked about nine different things you wanted to cover I think we've covered three so we still have\nOther stuff that Governor but you know when it comes to our process and how it works yes you cannot call and just say some of your lifestyle maximize er which\nIf you're talking to your be your friends and neighbors and they say hey I'm going to get this lifestyle maximize or it may not make sense to them 'cause that's something we created it's customized and it's cost them to the person that comes in so when somebody calls and they set up an appointment and and and what happens is\nCaramel send out just a little bit of a homework sheep that it's two pages for us to help gather some information about you so you you feel that information out and you come in you sit down\nIn the first meeting in our our meeting process is typically three or four meetings so some people want to race through it and get it done I've discovered over the years that if you rushed the process typically a lot of questions come back later and then it creates uneasiness and security and I don't want to do that so I Want to make sure that\nWe set the expectation correctly everything is step by step and it's a process and what that means if you come in for the first meeting we sit down we talk about what some of your goals are what some of your aspirations are I'm going to ask you what you're trying to achieve and when you want to achieve it\nAnd so I I often say there's an emotional side of that meeting and then there's a financial or if you know a a a number side of it so we're going to talk about some of the stuff you'd like to do what's important to you when you're trying to achieve but then we're also going to talk about where do you have some air assets I'm not going to look at your statements I'm going to ask you to bring them in just in case we go to the next step\nSo the next step is you know so let's say we get done with this hour meeting and we both mutually agreed that it makes sense to go to the next step\nAnd that is the only question you'll ever ask me or hear me ask you the question is going to be what would you like me to do next and that's it so this is not a sales job this is not very upset and you're going to get trapped in my office you never going to leave no\nIt's an interview I'm interviewing you and you're interviewing me and if it makes sense that after that first hour to go to the next step then we go on if it doesn't we part ways knowing that we had a nice cup of coffee we enjoyed our camaraderie we enjoyed helping and talking to each other but that's all that it was in that is a a oh okay\nBut if you say I want to go to the next step\nYou still do write a check you still don't spend any money what we do is we start to lay out our lifestyle maximize and this is where I Will take a look and I'll say okay\nLet's look at five key areas so let's make sure we talk about again goals and dreams but we also want to do this is me now taking all of your uh information some of your statements\nAnd we do a thorough look at where everything is so without getting too deep into thick into the weeds basically what we're going to do is we're going to evaluate\nWhere everything is what are some of the pitfalls whether some of the things you're doing well\nAnd it it becomes a blueprint for the lifestyle maximize or this this next meeting is like the foundation\nOf what are the things that we want to achieve what's working and what's not working you come back in for another meeting this one has this again no charge doesn't cost you a thing as long as we're both feel uncomfortable moving down the road we're on our way\nSo in the second leading takes about an hour I'm just going to lay out what I discovered very very educational\nYou know John I go back to my buddy that I was talking about that had unexpectedly\nHad six bypass surgery and then the two days later he's got a nine hour spinal cord surgery and it's a long road there's no question but I can guarantee you that my buddy did not care how the heart surgeon was doing the surgery he\nWanted to know did he do the surgery well and then\nWhen he went to the spinal cord surgeon obviously\nHey I Want to be able to walk again what in the world happen it's crazy it I'm going through this but I'm trusting that you're going to do what is in my best interests that is what how you operate in the financial world Europe for ... which means morally legally ethically obligated to do what is your client's best interest and\nI think that's really important as well because it's a two way street you know if I'm Talking to you about my retirement I'm the c._e._o. because it's my money is my retirement\nYou're the CFO the chief financial officer you do this every day you understand what decisions are good and water may be might be a little riskier and so it's about using your experience to help me come up with a plan\nFor me and my retirement\nYeah and then make sure 'cause people really what they want to know mark as they want to know okay\nCan I really trust John can I really have you know the kitten these goals really come true in we lay out and everything so will lay it out and I show everybody how it's going to happen what the probability is you know your success rate some of the things we have to be aware of\nAnd what happens after these meetings you know and and then after we implement everything I Want to stress also it doesn't and\nSo this is not like we're doing this once and then I'll send you on your way and I'll see you later now\nWe're starting to begin a beautiful relationship and it won't happen just like any other relationship that you've been involved in it doesn't happen overnight it takes time you know small steps over the course of a long period of time and then pretty soon you've got a great relationship and\nWe put together a lot of a lot of different things that we do throughout the year to help foster that relationship because my goal is to a first of all make sure that you could live below if you want to live\nSecondly I Want to create a community of hundreds successful people a hundred people who have\nYou know a figure it out or started to look at what's important to them\nAnd then I Want to bring those people together throughout the year at different events in different dinners and we do fun functions and we'll do a\nYou know sometimes we'll do charity events together sometimes we'll do a you know small trip together sometimes ... will have dinner together will do educational presentations to make sure you always know what's happening but I Want you to come together and meet my other people I'm very very protective of my people\nAnd the culture and when I talk about my culture I'm Talking about creating a great environment of great people and helping them discover what they wanted to do introduce you to each other and you guys were created ... community and and have\nNetwork of folks that used to be your work environment but it is now your retirement environment and instead of going to work and punched in the clock you're going to do and great stuff whether you're camping you're traveling you're doing the grandkids ball games you're seeing the kids of the grandkids you're doing the stuff that you love to do\nAnd that's what creates a great life it's not going to happen by accident it happens on purpose\nIt happens but you've taken the step and saying I'm going to call six one five six five six zero zero nine nine I'm going to take the first step I don't know if I'm going to take the second step\nBut I'm going to take the first step and make the phone call [laughter] so when you call ... set up a time it'll be as market mentioned when we started the show and case you're just joining us he called it a fireside chat [laughter]\nBut I Will be dressed I won't have a tie on but I Will be dressed so [laughter] I don't wear a tie\n'cause I ... I don't know if the gift but that's a different story out it's going to be a very comfortable easy\nConversation we're going to figure out what's important to you I'll share with you our process if it makes sense we go to the second step if it doesn't\nThe so invested so again the phone number is six one five six five six zero zero nine and\nOur goal for you to help you critical if you want to live\nPut up a bb out on his vehicle that's where I think and what he's on his way back from South Carolina Thursday so we we better be careful so well\nSeveral years ago um you know I I was partner and a marketing company and\nI got to drive this big Yukon and hall a fairly decent sized trailer behind probably eight ten foot trailer and it was enjoyable time we should spend a lot of time going back to back and forth to different colleges in the southeast\nAnd the hardest part of that whole tour that I did was driving the Yukon because of the blind spots there to be cars hiding that blind spot and I wouldn't even have nightmares at night after I got done driving that thing in part that\nThinking oh my gosh I'm so happy I didn't run over somebody because you you would just there's just no way to really know what was there and said this morning I thought that'd be a good story kind of intro our topic this morning which is blind spots in retirement and so those are the things that\nBasically they robbed us of a good retirement that keep us from retiring well we've got a nice list we pulled together and want to start walking through those so probably ... pen and paper you want to take some notes this morning and throughout the show if you have any questions or you want to schedule some time to come in sit down with beaten John at the beacon team\nFeel free to give us a call anytime six one five three nine five three thousand\nSo John let's start out with our list and at the top is hidden fees are one of those major blind spots that people can have when they're looking at a retirement plan so when we talk hidden fees how often do people come in that you meet with how often do they just simply not know the fees that they're\nPaying well it is is the large majority of the time I mean once in a while they'll come in and they'll have a fairly good idea of what their fees are met a lot of times they don't [noise] almost everyone understands their their management fees in terms of what they're paying their broker and that's something that definitely runs about one percent\nBut when we talk about fees were were not just talking about what you're paying your financial advisor or your broker we're talking about all of their internal cost inside of the funds which is which is an add on to whatever you're paying your advisor\n[noise] so I Would say it's very very seldom\nAnd then what I mean is there an average fee that people listening and go okay I can I Know if I'm above or below that fees or magic number\nThere well I mean it really depends on your investment structures what you have but I I Would say that that the most people\nAre paying two to three times more than what they think are that's not always the case but in most cases they they are and you know when you when you think about ways that people can find out what their fees are that's a question I get asked a lot\nYou know how do they know what they are well if you have mutual funds for example and and they're certainly opportunity for that at certain points\nThere are expense ratio so there will be one fees and transaction cost and where you find those er into perspective is now I think people should read the perspective says there's good information in there but most people when you surveyed empty if you ask them what they do with her perspective as a they made land send them but most of them will shredded milk or they'll throw them away\nAnd what I tell them is that if they just look at the fee area or section there's going to be a list of fees that they're paying\nAnd you've got to add those up and so if they don't know uh what those are are they don't want to read the perspective says that's partly analysis that we do for people\nIs we can take someone's portfolio what they currently have\nAnd we can tell them it's not sort of pie and this guy was stuff for opinion It's MORNING Star Wars and things that are very credible we can actually take their portfolio we can loaded into morning star and it's going to tell us what they're paying an internal cost so if for example just this last week I did one of these\nFor a couple who thought they were paying one percent that was actually there their managers fee which is the average um so I don't think that's overstated or anything like that up but their internal costs of their phones were one point nine sex so they're actually paying close to three percent\nUm versus the one percent that they thought they were paying and so there are ways for you to find out how much you're paying and you need to because the thing about paying too much and fees is like a double edged sword if your return is eight percent and your feet structures three you're netting five\nWell if the market's down ten percent and not saying the market's going to go down ten percent fees don't get wave and in the bad years so they add to the last so fees and taxes and now we're going to talk about taxes later in the show today those are I\nAnd what we found was that they could retire\nBut it was a little bit dicey and the fact that if they didn't get a better rate of return than what they were getting today that they probably ran into a problem about age eighty eight now they might not lived that long right but if they do I would rather know about that today well I still had a choice\nThen to get to eighty eight and realize I have a problem and so what they decided to do as a couple was to work for a couple more years and and there are a lot of cases were were able to tell people you know had to retire\nBut if you don't go through a process and you don't do the work\nOn really making sure that you've got the right number or whatever that is you're never going to know everything else is just opinion it's just an advisor telling you well you can retire because I said you can retire\nI don't want to retire that way I Want to make sure that I Know the number that I have is a number that I Need to retire and be able to support\nMy lifestyle so if you ready for that change in plan are you ready to put that plan together\nWe were just looking for a second opinion with no cost no obligations no hidden fees there maybe just one another set of eyes on just to kind of look at your plan and bring you that extra sense of confidence that we all want when it comes to our

folks making Capital Management\nWith offices in cool springs Brentwood mount Juliet and again drum roll what John is very excited about a new office coming soon to Murfreesboro now right there all the medical driving the avenues just so they can now we can be more conveniently located for I'm struck friends out there\nToday we're talking about retirement blind spots and we'd gone through several different things you talked about hidden fees not having affordable can tax plan not knowing your retirement number not optimized in your Social Security income and we're ready for a fifth on the list and that is not factoring in longer life expectancy or simply outliving your retirement plan\nSo John I guess uh some people find themselves kind of may be living in the past where they they can remember their grandparents or their ... their parents that they put together maybe a five ten maybe a stretch Fifteen year retirement plan and that's simply won't do any more because we've got people on retirement there\nNeed to put together a plan of twenty thirty forty plus years mhm so when someone comes in how do you help them determine\nBasically how do they keep from outliving their retirement plan\nThat's the number one concern of people in America today it's been a couple of years ago now but Wall Street journal poll\nWhere they they pulled the boomer generation they said how many of you are are highly confident that the plane you have today is going to get you know to retirement but through retirement supporting your lifestyle that survey said was that eighty three percent of the boomer generation that's a generational Seventy million strong retiring at about ten thousand a day in America\nThey were not highly confident and the truth is that there is no reason for that because you can be highly confident\nThat you're going to be able to sustain your lifestyle and you know it's interesting part of it just begins with with education\nAnd preparing people for the fact that that they could be retired longer than they're working we have clients now that have been retired longer\nThan they were working and people are just living large you know Nashville's an amazing community the health care that we have here is phenomenal or the advancements in in health care across the board people healthy they're active here and you know none of us are promised tomorrow anything can happen\nBut we want to plan for a very long a retirement and we want to have a good retirement you know Social Security for example when it first started life expectancies were were handful years seven or eight years and now people start Social Security uh sixty two and they're still taking Social Security in their nineties which is one of the things as\nThis put some stress on the Social Security trust and and that's a whole other topic\nBut you you really need to plan for a very long retirement in particular\nIf you're a healthy couple and let's say you're in your mid sixties there are some longevity studies that suggest that women in particular\nAre are going to live well into their nineties if they're relatively healthy and their their mid sixties\nAnd so but even for men you know I have a lot of men that will come in and see me they'll say well you know my father died at Seventy and I don't plan to live much longer than that you know and then they wake up one day and they're eighty or eighty four and they're still living independently and they're still you know taught about work it out I I have a client who\nWorks out every day and he's eighty three years old and and you know he would turn circles around me so people are just living longer\nAnd so this plays into how you want to make choices on everything that you may you know we talked already about Social Security but you know if the husband is the higher income earner\nYou a lot of times they'll look at Social Security choices for example or pension choices through their life expectancy but I encourage them if their wife is is healthy to look at things to their wife's life expectancy because statistically\nUs man you know I'm forty seven my wife has four days should kill me if she knew I was saying that on on the radio she's older\nRock and the ... credit but the reality is my wife is more than likely gonna far outlive me bend your wife is going to far outlive you and so when I make choices on assets I I Want to make those based on life expectancy is I have a grandmother who died six years ago she was Ninety seven I have one remaining who lives independently\nWho is almost Ninety five years old so you've got a plan for a long life expectancy\nSit down as you know inflation you know and to go to make changes or at one point nine percent and\nIt's been a to point ... percent and two dozen sixteen anti them Seventeen and the forecast is around that two percent mark again for two dozen Nineteen and twenty twenty so I I can only assume that inflation certainly plays a major factor weren't looking at making sure we don't outlive are expecting say\nSo how do you guys factor that into someone's retirement plan I mean it's huge\nI mean is absolutely huge and the question I Would ask is do you have a written inflation plant because that's something we do for every one of our clients because you know if your standard of living and I'll just throw a number out there's five thousand dollars today I that's not going to stay at five thousand dollars I mean just think about\nHow things have gone up just in the last ten years I mean ten years ago it was a gallon gas not what it is today how much how much was milk ten years ago five years ago two years ago\nYou know things go up over time\nAnd you know when you talk about roughly two percent inflation been one of the things I Would add to that is that what the the fed tells us or the federal government tells us is inflation is around two percent in what they're talking about there and that is true\nIs core inflation but core inflation does does not include food and energy and so if you think about someone who is retired water to the biggest line items to your budget while their food and energy you don't retire and stopped going to the grocery store fill in your car up with gas when you travel", "show_name": "Beacon Retirement Strategies", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
