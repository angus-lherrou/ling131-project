student loan people they get zip nothing nada\nOkay to assist or she gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going that's very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension I knew it in Hershey kitty\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nHas ended up getting paid fifty on on on each one\nAnd it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks settles a whole dead or something like that and clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get\nNothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attaching annuity\nAnd so\nThat she's what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dimension she has no assets and are only income his pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that from Utah natural coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offered

it get started\nBeacon retirement stress Vincent John Mack\nYou're ready to retire with confidence home right now\nSix one five three nine five three thousand\nSix one five\nThree nine five three\nZero zero zero\nWelcome back on John max in here with the fence and you're listening to weaken retirement strategies radio show and we've been talking about today [noise] seven steps to retirement\nReadiness this comes out of a Forbes article that Pete and I had read not long ago and these are seven critical steps and so we're unpacking these things because the truth is a lot of people out there in fact you were talking about earlier that a third of people in America don't think they'll ever be able to retire and that's a travesty that really is if you want to keep working\n'cause you enjoy what you do that's one thing but to not think that you can retire literally a third of our population that's the tragedy so\nHow can you make sure you're in the two thirds of the retires the way that you want to retire and support your life so you need to have a plan and that's the first step in the seven steps\nIn a plan begins with understanding what you have right now and is it suitable inappropriate for the stage of life you're in do you have the appropriate risk and that type of thing or your investments going to do for you what you think they're going to do for you and the only way you find that out just to have some research done for you and for that to be able to be proven out\nThrough its good advisor and the second step that we talked about was making sure that you have an income strategy it does matter\nWhether or not you have a source of income during market fluctuations reality is that the market will go up the market will go down which you don't want to be in ... in retirement is is a retiree that has to sell a bunch of securities during the downturn because markets eventually come\nBack no question about that and if you have solid income those market volatility seasons that we see their their weathered a whole lot better on your behalf of\nYou have a solid income plan and so few people have that so now as we get into this next segment here ... we're going to start with the third step and I'll tell you this is a big one that this is a huge step there's never been a better time to address this and this is creating a strategy for minimal\nTaxes in retirement now\nMost people think that in retirement you're deductions have gone away you can do a lot about taxes but we believe in and believe we can prove this to people\nThan retirement unfortunately people do less planning but they have more control over how much they pay in taxes in retirement than probably any other point of their life absolutely so you need to create a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement\nThat's the best time to pay the least amount of taxes\nAnd you can but only if you have a strategy that looks ahead three years ten years Fifteen and Twenty years the earlier you begin\nThis strategy the better because\nThe tax reform act um these individual tax rates that we have now where taxes are literally on sale and your your bandwidth is wider that you can make a higher income still stay in the same bracket\nThere's opportunities for Ross conversions and other types of tax strategies that you need to take advantage of and each year that goes by and you don't you've missed out on that\nBecause these things are going to end in six to seven years so the ...\nEarlier began the better you need a forward looking tax strategy not one that looks back and re acts but one that's proactive\nAnd you need to think about required minimum distributions uh they're all taxable and it could double your tax burden and it's like a domino effect how day which you have to take\nHave effect on taxes on Social Security and all those kinds of things so you need to have a plan for this and what is your plan right now whoever you're working with are they talking to you about this and developing a plan that might be possible for you to pay less in taxes are you getting all the pieces of the retirement puzzle\nThat's very very important the beacon retirement blueprint that we utilize one of the five pillars is having a tax strategy so what's holding you back from retiring right now well probably the fact that you don't have\nYet attack strategy as well\nAnd let me tell you why this is so big I was talking to a couple and and we'll call them a bill and and Tammy Knoxville and have enough to ... we were talking just the other day ... about one point three million in an IRA and some other assets they worked really hard and we start talking about taxes and\nAnd I said you know a year and a great position you put money away and you saved and sacrifice than wise has said but that comes with some unfortunate news and\nThat kind of looked at me confused and I said you know you've got this IRA that you've got about one point three million ... that's the good news bad news is it's not all yours\nAnd they looked at me somewhat confused and he said what do you mean that's not all money goes we we worked for that we say for the said yes but you didn't save taxes you deferred that\nAnd ... as you start to take money as account what do you have to do and he kind of looked at me and shrugged and said well I I have to pay taxes I said right and taxes are like a debt\nAnd so what we did and we have some actuary software so the suffer was written by a friend of ours ... who's a renowned actuary so its factual\nAnd we can take that IRA or that defer to counter the total here tougher to counseling we can take your current tax bracket and we can show you what your tax burden is going to be on that money over your lifetime to required minimum distributions and reinvest and record minimum distributions and then at that\nAnd I will tell you that for most people it is an eye opening experience do you know what the number was for him was over seven hundred thousand dollars wow what a one point three million dollar IRA which may seem unbelievable\nBut it's not when you try it out and then we were able to show him ways by utilizing available legal and ethical tax strategy how he could not eliminate that but how they could substantially reduce that\nIf you can keep more money in your pocket by reducing taxes and take advantage of the incredible tax reform we've just been given why wouldn't you at least have a conversation about that\nSo tax strategy is really really important and then the fourth step we want to talk about after taxes is creating a strategy for withdrawals from an IRA or four one K. and this is this is important we tell folks have we don't get paid to help people with Social Security choices but it does affect your life how much does it affect your life for well for many", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beacon Retirement Strategies", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
