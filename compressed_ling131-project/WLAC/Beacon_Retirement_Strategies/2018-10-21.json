event as far as the flag goes with will get down to tell them how Murray M Star Spangled banner a yelling in a lever is going to be saying and that they share\nWill are certainly a lot of spirit to go around for the holidays and for a while for patriotism I suppose that's a good way of looking at it as we we wrap up your ... he just wanted to make sure that you know there's a lot of details that

information on the Facebook page and highways forty one ... thanks so much for your time\nI Want to thank for your time and helping us out the door and vaguely appreciated\nI'm Robin ... one of the radio network\nI'm done the guy that they can that I'm ready and uh I'm just going to step off into a\nRetirement wouldn't that be a great thing but how does one though when they say enough and how does one oh\nThat their money is going to last forever I Know John that you get that that question a lot you know they come into our office and and it's like you know where these uh gurus add this all figured out before we even know them it's like do you think my money last as long as long as I Do I mean who has the answer to\nThat well it's really were planned comes in and there's the seven steps that we believe that you need to take in terms of an action plan is going to\nLead to you retire and in many cases probably sooner than you ever thought possible you know college football's here and Tennessee So far having a little bit of rough year but I I'm ... I'm a I'm not a bandwagon fan I'm I bleed orange tree you you're you know one of these years I'm not going to have to listen to you kind of give it to me\nBut you know there's a strategy to teams that win sure there's recruiting there's coaching a and then they a coach will come in and they'll take recruits hopefully to a new level you know the titans the same thing the predators we've seen some incredible successful the predators retirement planning is really no different\nAnd there there are seven steps that we feel like as a firm that you need to consider as you approach this whole issue of retirement and potentially being able to\nRetire sooner than what you thought possible in the first step fever going to get into these and and the additional segments today\nBut the first that we just kind of want to summarize them is nothing's\nGonna happen without a plant yeah I mean having a plan and you talk about back to college football or any type of\nA a sporting event you have to have a plan to know that you're going to win and if anything you want to win and his retirement\nUh I actually came across this subject as we build out this uh topic for today\nA in a Forbes article that had come out in titles seven steps to retirement reading this so obviously it caught my eye and these are the kinds of things that we've been preaching in teaching to our people and we continue to will do it again next year the year after five years from now ten years from now\nThese things don't get old they're so so important nothing happens without a plan every family needs to have a plan and it needs to be well thought out it doesn't need to be a hope so and that may be and I think so and and they don't need to be winging it they need to have\nA written plan like John if you're going on vacation\nAnd you map out and plan out a trip\nExactly where you're going to stay if you're you said you're going to Dali would I mean there's preparation beforehand about where are we going to stay and this is this place going to have enough room for the kids to run and crazy and wild\nAnd uh maybe now get hurt too badly and\nThey are going to be any room where you can kind of pull off and be silent for a moment or walk in the woods you have to have a plan of how you're going to get somewhere what you're going to do where are you going to say all these kinds of things that's just a vacation that could last a few days to a week or two\nWell it's a couple of things that you know number one my wife as a teacher so she has a plan for everything number two um I had planned on walking in the woods ... for a couple of days that I heard about some people that ran into a couple of bears just the other day so I'm not the fastest growing world I figure that won't that's not going to work out to us we're probably going to stay out of the woods but we do have a plant\nAnd you're right and the second step is in retirement is developing a pre determined income strategy you know I was singing with a couple just this last week and um we had met several times and we begin to implement the plan and in the meantime the wife had retired five or six years ago and the husband that just recently retired\nAnd and I could I could feel that there was this tension in the room and\nAnd I finally just looked at him and I said okay a Bob in pain that's not their names its will come what what are you sensing what are you feeling he said\nHe looked at me and he said I just realized we're not getting a paycheck anymore and he says the first time I haven't got a paycheck and thirty eight years and he said John I'm scared to death\nAnd I said well the ... the good news is you've been responsible and you've saved and I said we've we've got an income plan and I was able to go through and show them exactly where\nThey were to get their income from if they live ten years Twenty years Thirty years and then of course that brought a lot of peace of mind but Pete how many people do you know\nThey're retired that don't have an income plant just about everybody I mean when they come in they don't have one that's right and and they just essentially transfer their money into some funds with no formal life plan in terms of how they're going to get income so you want to have a plan you want to have a pre determined in complain the third step is\nCreating a strategy for minimal taxes and retirement\nWow that's that's a hot topic of today and it's probably will be for the next few years because of tax reform\nAnd then our debt is Twenty one trillion dollars\nOr the servicing the debt it just takes enormous hundreds of billions of dollars just to serve as the debt and his interest rates rise that's going to cost us more\nSo having a forward looking strategy for taxes is so so important and we're going to elaborate on each of the steps a little bit later but I'll just keep on moving along just to give you a taste of what our topics are going to beat today creating a strategy for withholding\nFun with holding a\nFrom your IRA and four one K. how do you do that required minimum distribution that kind of thing and the next one creative strategy for your Social Security benefits while I mean people need that big\nTime well the truth is there's there's dozens of ways you can take Social Security\nAnd most people don't look at all the options that they have on the table there's some options if you were born before Nineteen fifty for that you have that people that that don't have that were born after Nineteen fifty four [laughter]\nThere's a guaranteed eight percent compound between full retirement in Seventy do you take that do you wait for that do you not wait for that\nSo Social Security accounts for about twenty to thirty percent on average now for everybody of retirees income if if that's going to be twenty thirty percent of my income I Want to have a plan for that to maximize that which is one of the reasons why would you Social Security strategies for folks\nSo after you get those in place in Social Security are going to move on ... and you're going to talk about your plan matching your risk tolerance and this is a big one\nWell it really is a as we get older and you know since the the latest during the last huge big\nA drawdown of the market fifty percent in ... eight and part about nine or the market's done nothing but go up and eventually we all know there's going to be another correction maybe even worse but when it happens think about this now you're ten years older maybe or\nA twelve Thirteen Years from retirement but when this one happens you're two years from retirement it's a whole different a framework and maybe the last time it happened a you weren't even in retirement and now you are in retirement so\nHow do you know what your wrist score is truly most people have no idea and then the last one is a number seven plan for a long retirement um we have some clients that have been retired TWA\nThe twenty five thirty thirty five years I have a couple of clients that actually been retired longer than they work believe it or not so you have to plan for a long retirement not a short retirement so\nHow would feel if you could drive to work on Monday knowing you don't have to keep working knowing that you are now ready because you have a good answer to all of the seven things\nOn the other hand have you made plans to retire in a certain date and you're not sure if you are really ready people are looking for confidence confidence equals freedom if they don't have the confidence they're not going to feel free or are from we we talk about income plan investment plan tax plan healthcare plan\nAnd legacy plant all those things you need to have a plan for\nYeah and can you answer these two questions do you know exactly when you can retire or do you know how much you can afford to spend every month when you do retire those are important questions if you don't know the answers to these questions\nAt the fastest way that we know to run through your entire life savings far far too soon but we can help you with that we can help your family get clarity on these questions and more\nWith what we call our beacon five step retirement action plan this customized plan covers five essential areas of investing that could make your money go further into retirement including Social Security plan for taxes how much risk you have versus what you should have an income planned\nAnd how to get the most out of your IRA and four one K. and that would include things like tax efficiencies in keeping more money in your pocket working for you and your family the truth is you can never avoid taxes on everything\nBut you can in fact reduce them and being fish and if you have a plan there's

they had a built in retirement income plan or from the company they work for Social Security hours at a cost of living increase great pensions or some people retired and actually got an increase in pay just by retiring because their pensions were so strong but\nMost of you don't have a pension I don't have a pension so what are we going to do well it means that each of the building blocks that makes up a very viable a income plan\nNeeds to be well thought out when to take Social Security that's going to account for a third of your income\nUh what else along with that what are you going to add to it are you going to add bonds well there were times\nAre in the eighties nineties even early to thousands bonds were doing really really well people were making five six seven percent it was a good product for bond funds and um they were able to take income off those and and that was good but\nI wouldn't say right now is the best time to do that as rates are beginning to rise we're seeing

wait until you walked my\nJohn max\n... title\nOn five three zero [noise]\nHe can retirements stress defensive John\nYou're ready to retire with confidence cold right now\nSix one five three nine five three thousand\nSix one five\nThree nine five three\nZero zero zero [noise] we'll come back on John max in here with the fence and you're listening to weaken retirement strategies radio show and we've been talking about today [noise] seven steps\nTo retirement reading assist comes out of a Forbes article that Pete nine red not long ago and these are seven critical steps and so we're unpacking these things because the truth is a lot of people out there in fact you were talking about earlier that a third of people in America don't think they'll ever be able to retire and that's a travesty that really is if you want to keep working\n'cause you enjoy what you do that's one thing but to not think that you can retire literally a third of our population that's the tragedy so\nHow can you make sure you're in the two thirds retires the way that you want to retire and support your life so you need to have a plan and that's the first step in the seven steps\nAnd a plan begins with understanding what you have right now and is it suitable inappropriate for the stage of life you're in do you have the appropriate risk and that type of thing or your investments going to do for you what you think they're going to do for you and the only way you find that out is to have some research done for you and for that to be able to be proven out\nThrough the good advice or um the second step\nThat we talked about was making sure that you have an income strategy it does matter whether or not you have a source of income during market fluctuations reality is that the market will go up the market will go down\nWhich you don't want to be in ... in retirement is is a retiree that has to sell a bunch of security during the downturn because markets eventually come back\nNo question about that and if you have solid income those market volatility seasons that we see their their weather and a whole lot\nBetter on your behalf of you have a solid income plan and so few people have that so now as we get into this next segment here ... we're going to start with the third step\nAnd I'll tell you this is a big one that this is a huge step there's never been a better time to address this and this is creating a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement now most people think that in retirement you're deductions have gone away you can't do a lot about\nTaxes but we believe in and believe we can prove this to people then retirement unfortunately people do less planning but they have more control over how much they pay in taxes in retirement than probably any other point of their life\nAbsolutely so you need to create a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement that's the best time to pay the least amount of taxes and you can only\nIf you have a strategy that looks ahead three years ten years Fifteen and Twenty years the earlier you began\nThis strategy the better because\nThrough the tax reform act um these individual tax rates that we have now where taxes are literally on sale and your your bandwidth is wider that you can make a higher income still stay in the same bracket\nThere's opportunities for Ross conversions and other types of tax strategies that you need to take advantage of and each year that goes by and you don't you've missed out on that\nBecause these things are going to end in six to seven years so the earlier began the better you need a forward looking tax strategy not one that looks back\nAnd re acts but one that's proactive and you need to think about required minimum distributions uh they're all taxable and it could double your tax burden and it's like a domino effect how day which you have to take\nHave effect on taxes on Social Security and all those kinds of things so you need to have a plan for this and what is your plan right now whoever you're working with are they talking to you about this and developing a plan that might be possible for you to pay less in taxes are you getting all the pieces of their retirement puzzle\nThat's very very important the beacon retirement blueprint that we utilize one of the five pillars is having a tax strategy so what's holding you back from retiring right now well probably the fact that you don't have\nYet attack strategy as well\nAnd let me tell you why this is so big I was talking to a couple and and we'll call them a bill and and Tammy ... enough to ... we were talking just the other day had about one point three million an IRA and some other assets said worked really hard and we started talking about taxes and\nAnd I said you know a year and a great position you put money away and you saved and sacrifice than wise I said but that comes with some unfortunate news and\nThat kind of looked at me confused and I said you know you've got this IRA that you've got about one point three million is that that's the good news the bad news is it's not all yours\nAnd they looked at me somewhat confused and he said what do you mean that's not all money goes we we worked for that we say for the said yes but you didn't save taxes you deferred that\nAnd as you start to take money as a count what do you have to do and he kind of looked at me and shrugged and said well I I have to pay taxes I said right and taxes are like a debt\nAnd so what we did and we have some actuary software so the suffer was written by a friend of ours ... who's a renowned actuary so its factual\nAnd we can take that IRA or that defer to counter the total here tougher to counts and we can take your current tax bracket and we can show you what your tax burden is going to be on that money over your lifetime to required minimum distributions and reinvest and record minimum distributions and then at that\nAnd I will tell you that for most people it is an eye opening experience you know what the number was for him is over seven hundred thousand dollars while and a one point three million dollar IRA which may seem unbelievable\nBut it's not when you try it out and then we were able to show him ways by utilizing available legal and ethical tax strategy how he could not eliminate that but how they could substantially reduce that\nIf you can keep more money in your pocket by reducing taxes and take advantage of the incredible tax reform we've just been given why wouldn't you at least have a conversation about that\nSo tax strategy is really really important and then the force that we want to talk about after taxes is creating a strategy for withdrawals from an IRA or four one K. and this is this is important we ... we don't get paid to help people with Social Security choices but it does affect your life how much does it affect your life for well for many\nPeople in America most impact Social Security is going to account for about twenty to thirty percent of your retirement income so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beacon Retirement Strategies", "city": "Nashville", "day": "21"}
