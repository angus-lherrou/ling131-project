what's happened in ... a rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason we use the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job wanting out the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of of domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nAh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nGovernor out I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation and\nYou know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow

mansion or don't you're not vote for the nominee don't get people to get their humor lack God that they might get out of their own political south actress\nWho factory right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins\nAnd Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski inflate\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah yeah and\nI I mean [laughter] don't\nReal does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's conscious of the conservative ... and it you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter]\nAre delusional you will never be the president of the United states not

their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of\nIt they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally in forever is with time share ... team\nThey have offices all around the country where you

Ramsey eight hundred\nOf you do what's your opinion of buying a vacation home with cash and the renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with the last as long as you're not with cash and your debt free everything about that I mean your homes paid for everything else just paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start buildings from wells but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to after you\nPay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property manager I usually take half of it the managers and that covers you know made service and that kind of stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a high season with a ski house or your house and the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of you're awake\n\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not gonna be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money per ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or to build wind on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there is a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your\nBed and you just have to think about that you know and you know it's\nJust it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not he wasn't a frat party in there it was you know babies and\nGrandma ... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I don't think we broke English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\n\nWe put it this way for Sharon Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place are broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd uh all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a a lake house we don't rented out we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that are weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall met worse and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nBeing you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped and there are going to be on a condo over in Knoxville in one of the ball game over there and the he narrows out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more ... more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you can handle that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine James", "year":
