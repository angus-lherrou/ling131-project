I'm going to go through what it takes the different kinds of low back issues exactly what caused the where it's coming from um exactly what you need to be doing it home to fix this like that and then some of them kept me fix on your own at home I can just tell you that right now and I'm going to tell you exactly what we do in the office we have these specialized techniques\nThat have been proven and only techniques that have been proven by research to actually re grow would be asked to fluff disjointed space back up the way it's supposed to gang\nAnd I'm going to just tell you now the number one thing everybody thinks of when they think of low back issues\nIs\nThe discrimination right and I'm going to dive into that and I'm going to talk about disk and I'm going to talk about everything guys this is I call in show so if at any point you have any questions or on ask questions about this our phone number is six twenty five for four or five seven seven zero one that is for four or five seven seven zero one\nEvery show I open up about twenty he knew patient spots in my office so you can get a console things and the special X rays if ever you want to call in and ask questions feel free to do so and I'm going to dive right into\nThe low back issues now number one low back problems are caused by trauma over time in general like that and when I say that\nYou say well isn't degeneration normal doc isn't it normal that I as I get older I have more arthritis is I have more and I would tell you no game I Would tell you now that I have seven year old patients in my clinic that are running marathons that are playing with her grandkids and then I see twenty five year old patients in my office that\nHave pretty bad degeneration already they've had a lot of injuries in their lifetime and nothing was ever done to properly\nFix them and I'm going to walk you through how scar tissue works and how your body responds to that because the most common low back patient that I think is the office worker you sit at a desk forty hours a week right and you're leaning forward\nOver your desk you're sitting at the computer had his forward here and there's all sorts of issues that go along with it but the fact is is that that wearing payer over time most people don't have traumas most people aren't in major car accidents most people don't have\nMajor slip some balls injuries that calls that acute pain that trauma that's a whole different case but the ones that we see in the ones that we take care of the most of the patients that day in and day out\nSit on that and their hit some publisher out of line that their energy levels are down because I Want you to think about this the white guy designed our bodies to heal okay you have thirty two pairs of exiting nerves out of the spine of course of the brain controls the entire body correct correct name\nAs they come out of those nerves if those bones and your spine shift out of alignment and they start grinding on each other\nThat grinding motion pinch is a nurse so yes you have a pinched nerve when you have problems with that low back and that pinched nerve causes swelling issues and down in the low back those nerves only the only control paying less than ten percent of the nerves in your body\nFeel pain or discomfort so by the time you're having pain\nUsually we've already had these other issues those nerves in your low back\nThough down in the legs on either side and that ... and we're going to dive into that so if you have radiating pain into either way okay that means that it's way more severe\nThan just the isolated low back issues that you have every now and then those nerves also go to the digestive tract they go to reproductive Oregon's they control your hormone balance and they control your energy levels so a lot of times what we see in our clinic is that the patients that have looked back issues also bad energy\nRight and this is debilitating when people have this for years and years and years they just can't seem to get out of it and what I'm here to tell you is that there is absolutely\nA fix guys\nWere doing the console the exams and the X rays for forty bucks we're right up against\nThe next commercial break All right our phone number is four or five seven seven zero point if you have any questions whatsoever hanging with this I'm going to talk about those ... exactly supplements\nYou need to be doing at home what exercises you need to be doing at home and I'm going to give you everything for that [noise] this is Dr just an art and we'll be right back [noise]\nThe ad for this regenerative medicine our eye in your house Dr Justin art [noise] we've been talking about low back issues that last segment and I'm going to die straight\nInto batting this hernia operation that everybody talks about those pinch nerves in your lower back\nThat we see every single day in our office and got it and you know the person may even be you know so you may have mild low back pain you may have a ton of low back pain but I'm going to give you solutions on exactly how to fix it\nDoes we do this every single day in her office mild as his exit his health center we're down in Brentwood [noise] um our phone numbers for four or five seven seven zero one if you ever had any questions give us a call we're here\nTo help you know those discrimination\nI see hundreds of people a day come into my clinic and eighty percent of the new patients we see have low back injuries and they all come in and they all say the same thing they say I've got a pitch nerve in my little back and most of them are correct the problem\nIs is that we don't know the difference between the types of discriminations when we hear the word discrimination\nWere sinking surgeries were thinking they've got to go in and remove the disc or they're going to go in with those big screws and screw everything together and that is absolutely\nNot true for most people most people do extremely well with conservative care as a matter of fact because our medical system my mother is in our in my dad's a paramedic I grew up in the hospital and our medical ...\nThey've torn through the scar tissue it is much weaker than that\n[noise] so every time that happens these are your flare ups like that so I see so many patients that come in and they go what's not constant but um one year ago it was bad and then it happened again in six months and then it happened again two months later and then it happened again this month which is one month later and now it's constant\nSo rarely is one issue but more of these issues over time so when we do our special X rays and special exams on patients you may even need an MRI if you already have an MRI bring it in with you we will be glad to go over with you guys but I'm here to tell you that low back surgery in most cases is not the answer\nI think that the results for that and I don't even have to tell you how unsuccessful they are but you can look that up yourself as a matter of fact\nYou're seeing less and less of them because they don't want to go through that reason they want you to go do conservative care they want you to do some of these masses do at home to strengthen because it's not only about relief right now it's about relief ten years from now okay the Rodney came into her office\nAnd [noise] Rodney he's an athlete

life that they were designed to live okay nobody can afford to be sidelined by pain and honestly it's a big burden on my heart because I see people with this every single day\nOkay they say oh it's going to be good oh it'll get over it later oh I don't need to do anything about it I'll just wait\nAnd I'm here to tell you that there is every piece of research that's ever been presented says that the longer you wait the more arthritis you felt\nThe more degeneration that develops the more bigger the bone spurs get the more those disc degenerate over time so that ... disc disease that digital joint disease\nAs I'm here to tell you right now that that was that is a hundred percent preventable but it takes action on your part in case you have to have one haven't finished them as if you have a pitch nerve\nOkay and you're low back then I can tell you now\nThat you're going to need some kind of care in our office I Am\nA chiropractor by my doctorate degree like that but we specialize in regenerative medicine\nProcedures we have specialized tables that will actually fluff the disc back up it's been proven to regain X amount of space which takes the pressure off the nerve which in most cases for patients like that almost all cases prevents them from having to do surgery on it\nSo if you're one that's going man I don't want low back surgery because I Know people that have had it not I don't want those make rods and screws put in there\nThey give us a call guys our job is to prevent that from happening\nIs to get you back up and doing the things you need to do our phone numbers for four or five seven seven zero one just leave that name phone number what part of town you're coming from and we're going to get back to you ASAP to see if we can get you out of pain and prevent that surgery for you\nSo today shows have been a low back issues okay look back problems like that I Want to talk about the disc itself from ... and what ...\nReally looks like dang because I come in all the time to the office and have patience either side I have ... and what fad like a really is okay one Sadek a real ... debilitating okay that real Sadek a is when you have a disk\nThat has been somebody generated over time that you do something usually mild usually you pick up couch you pick up a child or you go to throw a baseball and pow you're down on the floor and game and it tears that disk enough where it protrude Jeanette pushes out and squeezes the nerve against the bone\nAnd whenever that happens that is a true pinched nerve well those nerves in your low back come out and they go down in the legs on either side ... if it is bad enough\nYou're going to experience muscle problems in your lower legs so you're not going to be able to lift your foot in the way you're supposed to you're going to have a date issue and usually that leads to bad muscle issues you're going to have any problems you're going to have a hip problems\nAs it goes on long enough the problem with that is is that the longer that nervous left alone\nAnd the longer that there is pressure on my nerves that nerve itself starts to degenerate we're not talking about arthritis or bone spurs\nCame we're talking about the nerve itself starting to die these nerves control your energy levels\nSo ... nerve does not functioning properly type pinched nerve or better yet what if I just cut that nerve into what happens to the lower body well dies because it can't connect to the brain\nTo be able to tell them how to heal properly so instead of cutting that nerve what if we just passed and are a little bit okay those bones missile wine and the disparate truth on it and it's pinched that well then the lower body is not going to be able to heal at a hundred percent it's only going to be able to heal it fifty percent\nSo imagine if you walked around with fifty percent energy which is what most people do by the way I mean ... or like that with a massive pain that's going down your leg\nRight and I promise you that I Would talk to you about the treatments at home that you can do for this so\nI'm going to go through some stretches exercises and supplements that you can do at home that we make our patients that I make because let's face it this is a fifty fifty process I can only do so much to you in the office and then you have to be willing to help yourself outside of the office for you to get those perfect results\nNumber one is you've got to focus on information problems okay I told you small inflammation is okay long term inflammation is very very bad because it generates joints so the number one anti inflammatory that you can do at home\nIs to work in game tomorrow you can be taken in pill form this is yes you are thinking Indian food um those types of things you can get in pill form you can get it and powders guys it is the number one natural anti inflammatory and pain reliever", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Estate and Financial Strategies", "city": "Nashville", "day":
