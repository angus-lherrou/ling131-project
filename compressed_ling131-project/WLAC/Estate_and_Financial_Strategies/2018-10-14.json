we don't take the normal X rays that everybody else has had we're almost always let's face it most guys have been to a chiropractor before and and you may have had great results you may have had bad results\nYet but the fact is that whenever patients come into our office they usually had X rays done before yet but that's really didn't show anything we've got one of the things that we specialize in in our office is we take these special motions study X rays\nSo not only are we going to take static X rays and go get greater you know it's bad or whatever that may be but we're going to have you move into these different position and these are functional\nX rays where we can literally see bone on bone does this joint work does this joint work how\nDoes the structural you look\nAnd whenever we

M. J. problems and teeth and how that affects your headaches guys we'll be right back [noise]\nWelcome back to the regenerative medicine ... our IM your host Dr Justin\nWe've been going at this guy today show is about headaches we've been talking about tension headaches them where they come from we've talked about migraine headaches and where they come from and I said this multiple times what is the number one cause headaches and the United states\nThe hydration you're not drinking or enough water\nIf it's out of your hands though and you've tried water and you're tired of medications because there is a type of headache\nCalled a rebound headache I Want you to think this and when you look up headaches on line thirty million people year get a headache every single day by day or at least once a week World Health organization says this will headaches it's not just this minor pain there is something wrong and it's serious if you have a headache once a week for a year\nThe fifty two headaches in one year then you\n... well I don't even know what the term is it's five times more likely that you have a stroke in your lifetime\nThinking about that per second one headache all week for one year you were five times more likely to have some sort of stroke in your lifetime [noise]\nThis is not about the pain this is about your body healing and functioning the way it's supposed to another type of headache we've talked about tension we talked about migraines what is the number one thing that most Americans dive into when they get a headache\nFor open a leaf Advil Tylenol aspirin headache powers these are all called and said ... anti inflammatory is these are all over the counter you eat them by the handful and go for it but there's also a type of pet it called a rebound headache the fact is that rebound headaches are caused by\nUsing anti inflammatory over the counter to treat tension headaches so if you take\nAn anti inflammatory ibuprofen to leave Advil any of those things over ten times a month if you use them ten times in one month then you're more likely to get rebound headaches when you're off of them so let's say\nHave a headache pretends straight days you take ... to get rid of them every single day okay then you're feeling good you stop taking that\nFor one week and then the third week you're headaches come back then but maybe there are a little bit different maybe they're not the same exact headache maybe not not induced by the same exact thing that guys you're experiencing rebound headache these are self induced headaches\nBecause most of us don't know how to get rid of them and we've only been taught one thing to do we've only been taught water we've only been taught try to stretch we've only been taught deal with it take ibuprofen leaving I'm telling you that is not the Right rally as we can get rid of your headaches forever\nUm my office is down in Brentwood we see hundreds of people a day as headache so the number one complaint that we get in dark hair practical office\nWe X. ray them and we do cool testing to see exactly these motions study X ray show everything they're exactly what's wrong exactly what the problem isn't exactly what needs to be corrected I can honestly say that most of our patients can do half\nOf the work at home on their own we can set them up with the correct exercises we can set them up with the correct stretching we can correct is our posture in the office and they're starting to become headache free some of them after one visit some of them after a month some of them after two months\nNot having headaches anymore and the fact is that the longer you've been having headaches\nSometimes the harder it is to fix because Mike tension headaches\nRight we talked about the nerves in the very top part of your neck if you sit at a desk all day long\nAnd your head is very far forward it's putting all the weight on the front of the bones that nursing home posture that were also are afraid of if that's left alone we're going to talk about this is a different show but it causes degeneration causes arthritis\nIt causes all that neck and mid ... shoulder pain that you're having as well because rarely does a person only have headaches I started getting these other things that happened to them and their muscles start spies among\nAnd they just don't know how to get rid of it so the longer it's gone on to more scar tissue develops sometimes the harder it is the fix but the fact is is that we've got to start making that change now because headaches keep us from our families\nHeadaches cost up as a zillion dollars in the medical industry so when you go in and you're going to go see a neurologist they're going to give you injectable you have to inject a needle into the base of your school if you start feeling or seen anything on and the fact is is most parents don't want to do that\nMay they don't want to spend a hundred dollars per injection wants to twice a week every time they start feeling like they're fixing to get a headache because none of that is preventing what is causing the headache and the first place\nWe're waiting until symptoms occur guys and we want action we want preventative action\nWe want you living their lives to the fullest we want you waking up every morning not worrying about if you took your medication\nBefore you went to work or what do you have at work to make sure that the headaches don't come back today or to prevent those headaches we want you going to work being productive thriving leaving work with high energy going home playing with your children playing with your family\nI have three children we've we I've mentioned family so many times my children are ages twelve\nSeven and six as we have sixth grader second grader first grader I my I Need that energy we're high energy go all the time three different sports all the time they do martial arts I'm leaving my clinic we're running\nEverywhere and I couldn't imagine having to do that with pain and the fact is is that when we're at the soccer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Estate and Financial Strategies", "city": "Nashville", "day": "14"}
