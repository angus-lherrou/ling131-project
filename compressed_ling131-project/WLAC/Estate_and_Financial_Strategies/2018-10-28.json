to order the cardio dot com K.\nNow this is I call in show this our phone number six five\nFour four or five seven seven zero one that is for four or five seven seven zero one and at the beginning of every show guys we open up twenty new patient appointments in our office again and what we do for that is instead of it being two hundred and fifty dollars like normal for X rays as we do the X\nRays the console the exam and then and\nThe reporter findings for forty dollars in case the best deal going guys and I'm going to throw that out there that is for four or five seven seven zero one\nAnd I'm going to die right in that today's topic is neck problems neck pain neck numbness tingling weakness down at the arms and hands these carpal tunnel symptoms and and the biggest problem that I see in our office\nHands down and you see it every single day is we're that head is pushed so far forward on your shoulders and your head is following board in your shoulders start around guys our bodies were designed and amazing image to heal the way it's supposed to so when your head bulls for them and shoulders you have all these posture problems\nIt puts all the weight on the front of the bones and they are not designed to hold white there so as those bones grind over time it causes arthritis\nIt causes at ... degeneration so that degenerate joint disease that degenerative disc disease\nSo many times people walk into my office and they go well doc that's normal right and the other part of getting old and I will tell you that that is absolutely not\nTrue and I I X ray patient every single day I have Seventy five year old patient with phenomenal spines they're not on medications they're out running marathons like that playing with their grandchildren and maybe you don't want to run marathons that's perfectly fine but maybe you just want to be able to sit at your grandchild soccer game like that without pain okay\nYou don't want to be at a Walker and you don't want to wind up in that nursing home I got that were so scared of every single day so I'm going to take you through exactly how to correct it and how to fix it some of these posture correction exercises that you can do at home and if it's severe\nWhat we get what we do in our clinic to get these results for patients don't have to have surgeries guys in the first thing is that when you developed arthritis degeneration\nAnd those bones or grinding back and forth at rice sometimes you can even feeling if you turn your head to the right and you turn your head to the left\nThe fact is that if you feel those bones grinding in there that is a bad deal and that is leading to more and more degeneration\nThe problem with new generation is two fold one is that it weakens the joint okay so over time the weaker that joins gets the more you're going to have problems from it number too though is that you don't feel it degenerating\nYou don't feel scar tissue in there you don't feel the desks I'm being eaten away you don't feel bone spurs growing in the body\nBecause less than ten percent of your body feels pain\nSo really what happens is is that joint weekends overtime it weakens over time and it weakens overtime until eventually it is so weak that we do something simple we sit and watch TV we pick up a child we um are playing a sport riding a horse war to end in all of a sudden boom\nThat just goes and we break or damage that joint\nAnd at that point we are told what your only option of surgery absolutely not true\nOne of the things that we specialize in our office is what's called non surgical spinal decompression where we had these specialized machines that will literally take the bones in separate them and it fluff up at this space and it takes pressure off nerves or you don't have to have surgery\nGuys like that if it sounds like you and you're going man my neck hearts I have all these issues carpal tunnel and then give us a call right now I told you we have Tony slots open and that is instead of two hundred and fifty dollar new patient special it's forty dollars that is your name give us a call it's for four or five seven seven zero one\nBut as for four or five seven seven zero one will do the console will do an exam on you I Will take some specialized motion X rays of you to show you exactly what the problem is\nI mean I'm going to go over with you like that and I'll show you exactly what it takes them will lay out a plan to\nGet a correct it does is the best they're all going to leave your name your number and the email address that we can see all the paperwork and then what part of the city you're coming from guys like that I Am Dr Justin hard we're up against the break I'm going to be right back and we're going to talk about blood pressure cholesterol thyroid problems and how they come from your\nPC [noise]\nCome back into the accidents our guys I Am Dr Justin art I envy co owner of Texas Health center we're down in Brentwood, Tennessee right there in Maryland farms guys and I'm here to tell you were on the radio every single week for two to three PM and it's phenomenal guys we\n... this week um we're talking about net issues and neck problems every single week we're going to pick one topic and talked about regenerative medicine and re growing joints\n'cause the purpose is like if you're the first time listener here our goal is to get you off those medications we want you living the life that you want we don't want you hindered my pain we don't want your having to take a handful of medications every single day I don't want you have\nTo have surgery if it's a necessary because we see so many of those patients that have already had surgeries and we can help okay don't get me wrong I got I had a new patient come in this week and he's already had rides but in the bottom part of his fine so he is having issues low back problems\nFrom an area that is unrelated\nTo the surgery and he goes back to a surgeon and they say well we can't help you because it's not what we did has nothing to do with us\nSo he's kind of at a loss and they're just like well we don't know what to do just kind of deal with it you another surgery and he goes no no no no don't on another surgery and he comes in our office with the radio special that we offer and we take him to do everything they console the exam with getting him started like that and within a couple of weeks he got a pain he's pain free because even though he has\nThose rods and the spine already as the previous surgeries don't preclude you from living the life that you want to live like that and that is our goal absolutely\nAnd today we've been talking about net problems came so I Want to dive right into it I Want every single nerve in your body type so the brains of the way we were designed God designed our body is an amazing way right to the brain controls every single function and founded the body\nFor your heart to beat for your lungs to breathe for cuts the heal that everything the signal is that from your brain damage spinal cord out through the nerves to the different organs in the body so if you want to take the nerve\nThat comes from your neck for example that goes down into your heart OK and you were to take it and you were to pass it just a little bit about what would happen to your heart\nWhat it would still work but it wouldn't work well she may have high blood pressure you may have high cholesterol you may have those racy skippy heartbeat she may develop and resume or you may get all these things but if you took the same exact nerve and you cut it completely into what would happen to your heart or your heart would die\nLike that it would not be able to function you have a perfectly healthy heart but the power supply to that heart is being cut off\nAbsolutely so think about this all those nerves Internet now any of this can cause pain okay so if you just had the simple old neck pain then that's a real simple fix but\nThose nerves in the top part of your neck come out and they run down into your heart\nAnd they control your blood pressure so the number one medication given to the United states today is blood pressure medications and maybe you're taking that was ... I got it is normal as long as you take it but the minute you get off your done\nI got it goes right back up like that if you don't want to take those methods anymore and give us a call and let's see if you have a picture of going to your heart and got the nerves in the lower part of your neck form what's called the ... nerve and it controls you're breathing\nAnd then so these as much as the COPD so I've got some people don't have any structural damage to the loan they just can't breathe properly and I'm here to tell you this as when your head fall so far forward on top of your shoulders and you develop that\nQuote nursing home posture and good and I want you to do this exercise with me right now so I Want you to sit up very straight\nAnd I want you to pull your shoulders back and I want you to pull your head back as far as you can hear and I want you to inhale impact as big of a deep breath as you can came in ... you can feel how easy it is the breeze in that position and now I Want you to do this\nI Want you to roll your shoulders forward and game and I want you to stick their head out as far as you can possibly go I'm doing this with us we speak and then I Want you to try to inhale as deeply as you can\nAnd what you feel is that you can't take a deep breath in that position\nYou can't do it because the muscles in your neck spasms and its pinching on those nerves that control your diaphragm you cannot in hell and you cannot exhale so you cannot get the oxygen end of the body that you need\nSo one of the things we focus on his pain I Want you out of pain pain is debilitating and paint us a motivating factor let's face it we're all good until we hurt and then we got to do something about it and and I'm here to tell you the pills\nPotions and emotions are not the answer to those types of problems because it doesn't stop the degeneration and these things only get worse you know that I Know that\nIt's researched trust me right\nBut the nerves in the middle part of your neck go to your thyroid gland\nBecame the thyroid gland controls energy levels\nThey control your body's ability to burn and reduce fat and body weight so some of the patients I see in my office come in they don't have any pain whatsoever and they come in and they say look\nI've been on firewood mad for five years I'm On high blood pressure medications I cannot sleep at night my energy level I think I Can't get out of bed until nine or ten I Am and I'm In bed by six pm because I'm drained I Can't function really well and I said I Can't lose weight\nThat and why surgeries are not the answer for that and what research tells us on that and I'm going to cover some exercises that you can do at home to start strengthening those posture muscles to keep you off those medications and out of surgery\n'cause I'm Dr Justin this is the exit this hour we'll be right back\nInto the accent is our guys I'm Dr Justin our co owner of exit his health center we've been talking about neck problems today and all of the they're called morbidity they've other problems associated with that comes as we think neck problems\nAs it's a huge huge issue in the United states right now everybody has pain President Trump is on TV talking about the opioid crisis in Tennessee I'm from Kentucky originally Tennessee and Kentucky are probably the two worst day\nIn the in the country with opioid crisis is because the only thing we've ever been taught to do with pain is to take a pill\nThat we we we go we we like we run into a minute clinic and they say here here's appeal here's a muscle relax or take that\nGreat you have anything else other than that no within go see a surgeon or maybe stretch or\nI got those options just aren't good as I grew up in the medical model my mom is an hour in my dad is a paramedic I grew up writing an ambulance is watching surgeries in the hospitals and I'm Hilda here to there was a time in a place for that\nIt is centered around crisis an emergency care do you have an emergency you go to the hospital but in order for you to get healthy and get off your medications and for you to be able to thrive do you think you need to go sit in the yard hospital do you think that's the best place for you know it's not designed for that\nAs a matter of fact we see patients in car accidents all the time and the number one problem coming out of a car accident is whiplash injuries that can happen in your neck it can happen in your low back and they go to the hospital and they get painkillers muscle relax hers\nAnd they're never evaluated for ligament damage or trauma or all of these other things that can happen for that and three months later they're works\nIn six months later there are a little bit worse after year their pain free of waiting it out because of the scar tissue but then they have severe degeneration from it and I'm here to take as that is not the way to go and what we were talking about last hour was the nerves in the neck\n[noise] excuse me the nerves in the neck controlling blood pressure that control your thyroid gland they control your cholesterol levels because of the inflammatory response and what I'm going to talk about this segment\nIs the pain of problems related with it the functional issues because remember those nerves in your neck All right God made is amazing so the ... those nerves come from the brain down the spinal cord out the nerves and that's what he does our body is what tells it to run with those nerves in the bottom part of your net come out of your neck\nAnd they run down through the back of your shoulders through your elbow into your arms and hands so if those bones and your neck missile wine and your head is falling forward it you've got digital right maybe you've already been told you have arthritis degeneration and I got and there's nothing that they can do for that is absolutely not true we see at corrected every single day\nAnd those Bones Are out of alignment they started grinding on each other that the longer they grind more to generation they're going to get the more pressure and pinching they're going to get on those nerves so few pinched a nerve in the neck that goes down in your arms and hands what do you think's going to happen the arms and hands\nThat well they're still going to function but you're going to have problems so the number one problem that we see what that is carpal tunnel type symptoms\nCarpal tunnel type symptoms like not only is pain and the risk ... but it's numbness in those fingers so if you have numbness or weakness loss of grip strength like I Can't pick up my coffee cup because it keeps slipping out of my hands and over the last few years\nAnd I got my crib has gotten worse and worse and worse guys those\nAre true signs that you have pets nerves in your neck\nThat are coming down in your arms and hands and they are not working properly and as over time those muscles get weaker and weaker and weaker and it doesn't stop until the eventually you'll lose that okay and I'm here to tell you this that what research tells us on carpal tunnel problems is that the surgery for carpal tunnel is about\nFifty to forty to fifty percent successful\nIn time for one year\nAnd then after that the symptoms tend to come back because rarely is it a risk problem I just want you to think about this the nerves come out of the neck and they get pitched here and they go through the shoulder where they can be patched especially\nIf you have that rounded posture again and then the elbow and then the hand like that with a hand in the last place that nervous going to be patched so if you have surgery to only ... at one place\nAnd its parents at the other three\nThen you're just not going to get that kind of relief because that causes the pain and the muscles in the mid back in between your shoulder bite the actor you get these weaknesses shoulder problems now it's like I see it every single day like that so if you're a person sitting there going man my my hands hurt\n'em I have weakness in my hands and he's talking to me [noise] then give us a call right now\nFor four or five seven seven zero one as for four or five seven seven zero one our office is down in Brentwood guys we are a full service\nCorrective chiropractic posture correction we offer regenerative medicine for really bad degenerated joints that you don't want to have surgery on we offered non surgical spinal decompression\nSo we lay out a plan that's best suited for your needs not everybody gets the same treatment because not everybody needs the same treatment\nAs in ... normally the console to examine our specialized motion X rays for about two hundred and fifty dollars each\nBit for the radio special we open up Tony slots at every show we're down to about what we got left nine right now nine slots available that we do that all for forty dollars\nBut as for four or five seven seven zero one so if you want to forty dollar ... all the X rays and a reporter findings and give us a call the guy who are obviously not in the office right now so you're going to get our answering service we just need you to leave your name\nYour phone number on what part of town you're coming from an email address where we can email you the paperwork guys we're going to get back to you as a as a piece that we'll get your set up and let's see if we can get you back\nOn your road to help us get your body heal let's get you off those meds and let's get your living the life that you were designed to live from time to be average six year old is on twelve medications in the United states\nBut it's entirely too many I'm here to tell you right now there's Ninety percent of them are on necessary we've just never been taught how to heal the body from inside out and that's what we want for you so for four or five seven seven zero one for that forty dollar console the exam and we were talking about carpal tunnel\nAnd shoulder problems that go along with it because when you posture really lose the forehead posture and you lose that big curve that you're supposed to have in your neck the way we were designed and in those bones start grinding on each other it moves a bone out of a line that maybe it was a trauma maybe it was a car accident and your car insurance should pay for all your care\nSome guys are no out of pocket to you but maybe it was just sports injury that happens usually go guys I played college football little professional football\nAnd I've I've got injuries from Fifteen Years ago I got that still ACT UP every now and then okay so maybe it's just been over time thing but I'm here to tell you that the longer you wait the more it's going to degenerate and the worst that get until eventually your only option of surgery\nWere not great in our country at preventing bad things from happening\nWe only a reactive so you have a bad\nDesk it's surgery but how do you keep a disc healthy well nobody's ever taught us that how do you avoid surgery I don't know that but if you go into a surgeon doesn't this is not the surgeons fault that\nSurgeons or surgery and that's what they do they do surgery that they're not their job is to prevent you how to not get surgery their job is to be the best darned surgeon on the planet\nOkay that's what I Want my surgeon to be I don't want him to be preventative guy like that I Want him to be the best darned surgery and on the planet so if I had a really bad accident in the disk in my neck I have a herniated disc in my neck\nThat is putting pressure impinging on nerves some game and my only option to start now you've got a lot of other options trust me my only option of surgery I Want the best neck surgeon on the planet\nOkay I'll get that done it a million times but if there is an option to prevent surgery", "show_name": "Estate and Financial Strategies", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "28"}
