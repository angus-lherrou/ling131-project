I can tell you only get better\nYeah I Know I Know I ... you know it it's so funny my new uh I Would have been in my life\nOr in the fund that I've had a a growing up that uh fifty five seemed like forever right in the future I didn't think I'd ever get here but I don't feel any different\nThan when I was when I Wish I had the brain that I have now when I was Twenty one it would have been I Would have been a whole different story\nBut let me ask you let let's let's start up a pretty directly um you're a dermatologist\nYeah and how how did you get into where you are today working with you know guys like Robert shock and Robert ... ball and now you're one of the leading Egypt colleges type researchers in the world right now you've\nYou've really done well for yourself but but what got you here\nYeah this is a you know this is one of those things you look back and it's just incredible sometimes you just you know you you uh you take a moment and if you ask yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the vine mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that's just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert ... a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um few a couple of years\nAnd forget about the other ... about how it was built or who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can be all\nThe way to relieve auditors um you know the ... century but see now this was in during person will um two thousand years after the fact and and what is the writing the way he described it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was starting to Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but\nYou would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's got to\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just too confusing is the great things we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn left um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of to dream still up between the parts of the things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh enter is up there is a small reference to afraid but it's it's it's book in a way so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the image towards the ... the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that what ... what I ...

my new uh we were talking about the inventories tell and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward\nAnd in the dream still up a ... for ... says mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nLike on my news website over a ... that goes to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review are or who was it was very well known or ... or drop your who don't we reviewed my paper\nAh he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by Clinton as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty two or three ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nTwo hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten\nUh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who said the pyramid was not completed there was a they say that was that was a virtual top so it was actually at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John Paul will fall and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to upend the season the back of the book where he explains\nThe theory so there are some people that think the pyramid was not coming to a peak and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of that Ficre layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is it every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck me when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you just you know simple mind that I thought each step\nThey weren't just applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed to appear in its with something called they called it set that which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how the conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's no regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that are sick or\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... I'm sure a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade into big tipper\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began\nTo oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big paper and we why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there that says coast to coast and we've got to take a break my knew this was ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free zones newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com [noise]\n\nKnow the guy\nWas nine years [noise]\nNext Monday raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age list male Macs a patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide we've\nFantasy football or soccer\nThen Joe Rogan experience all your music all your favorite station\nTo lead you to the ... ... ...\n... ...\nSo I think he will have\nCome out today one out of Thirteen children suffer from some form of asthma accounting for nearly one third of all emergency room visits\nTackled\nTensions continue between the U.S and Saudi Arabia ...

and again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is\nYeah ... pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of publish papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that ...\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery and so working from the bottom the first layer up\nA which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these ... these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth and\nI'm a and those are also listed and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation us and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know his courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that are exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this kind of way yes you need to have if you are going to a ... these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right well then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that alliance with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course on the twenty four also has a round fractional twenty fifth sixteen in this case and\nIt runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber uh then the other courses don't don't have round facts of the twenty fifth and they're not associated with ceilings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground a tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be\nA you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately\nThe top of the ... the big boys I got it yes yes of course we don't\nKnow exactly but we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land a ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go back a little tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things are Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yeah which makes go ... happy not an accident\nNo within references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to

archaeologist perhaps what specialty some remote viewing in tune into Washington and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\n... yes and as such a great question I'm so those two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to\nPartially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern be construction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question\nBut there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a\nA Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is the direction of Peter\nI'm a new alien um they are basically recreating gives a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to ah descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel that you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know just a simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just\nWaste I'm you know energy to create the sticker courses unless there is a purpose for so for every single of course that has around ... twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that more\nAnd more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he awash uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat is your access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research and the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with ...\nRegarding talked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a hermit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they've won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is is bizarre yeah how was she was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the ah the board of directors that reviews the data\nSo he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed\nBack here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research them and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being saved them political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah I mean there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stand and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back pedal yeah\nSo it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot and was that and you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA say or they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I going to take a quick network break this is coast to coast am more minute when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\n\nHe\nLoves to ease\nMentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more text proud to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P R O U D to seven nine six four or five\nStar to your online NBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dean oh and you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah\nUm I I\nAssume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYeah well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... provoke pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that here is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things\nEven a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in ... uh an and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI acting so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by eight and hide I'm saying\nRight you know maybe maybe\nA five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Donnan buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform ... studies it seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing\nThe the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any as excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiments I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you were saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive\nA project or in a project like this spending several million dollars a which we want to go back to distinguish and hope things that's a kind of money that will need for ... like\nThis is coast to coast am I going to be church it's been an all Egypt the

Egypt and our guest tonight my new safe side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers over on his website ... pyramid\nA dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now minute before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seemed to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra\nAnd we had that ah example of it but it was going on ... for a year she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide the amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this uh last week on my other show fade to black\nWhich is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years on this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time and more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because a ... a crime and cook a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and uh the only thing that survive or if some of these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one child as a you know when he lands on the planet that you think is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has a major and that you see the statue of liberty bird in
