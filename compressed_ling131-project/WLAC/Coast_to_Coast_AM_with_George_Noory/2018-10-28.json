{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WLAC", "content": "But ah the thing that you know I always try to nicely conveyed to people as they might say well I have a hundred thousand dollars sitting in my four oh one K. so I have a hundred thousand dollars for my retirement\nAnd I have to explain to them you don't\nYou have a hundred thousand dollars and Uncle Sam has a hundred thousand dollars to you all share together not account you're not sure how much of that is yours if you don't do some planning\nYeah and the great thing is here's the good news hopefully everybody's stay tuned for the fourth segment where actually bring up the good news so here's the good news is that you you can control these things you can take a larger stake in your own financial situation by putting into place just some very very simple things things that don't happen on their own\nThat um unfortunately the government doesn't really encourage us to do because it works in our favor more than in their favor but there are ways to balance your tax situation from an investment standpoint so that when you get into retirement or when you turned Seventy and a half and you have to start taking your required minimum distributions\nThat you have more control over your your marginal tax bracket you have more control over a at what rate your Social Security is taxed if it's even tax that all we can give you that control\nBut you have to call us and we have to sit down really have to put a plan in place because it will not happen on its\nOwn donut talking about you you were going to get out of paying taxes were talking about you have to follow tax law\nWith planning and investment investment regulations you have to follow those in such a way that you can do these things it's not just you're going to come in and we're going to say hey you had to worry about paying that I have\nMy magic can pay any taxes one yet I just wave over people's the county and they don't have to pay any more taxes\nSomebody tells you about that I haven't run lightly excuse to get out of it I\nKnow but but could you make you make a good point so we're not helping anyone avoid taxes right because it it we have to pay taxes but\nAnd we're not going to jail for anyone to go into jeopardy with us or we have to take control of our tax situation because if we're not in control of it if we don't put things in place so that we can control it who do you think control says right it's not saying that's right\nAnd we see how they spend their money and when we see what they think about social programs in it you know it and they're just trying to lower the national debt and they're making more problems trying to clean up old problems and it it we just they can't get caught up well what do we\nTalked about before with with people you know I often say you know it's not people who argue stuff like a trickle down economics or you know this tax rate versus a tax rate I mean we just had a big knock down drag out about a two point six percent tax cut at the top level when historically we've been fifty sixty Seventy Ninety percent\nHas been the top ... tax level you know so we get more to that another time but uh people don't realize that there are ways to just do things today that are going to help you down the road but once you get down the road there still some things we can help you with but they're not like the planning you can get done today yeah\nThat's true time time can be your greatest ally or your greatest enemy and it's all dependent on how you use it\nAnd the unfortunate thing that I've noticed ah being in this industry as long as I have is that\nThe average person weights past the point of opportunity for ... maximum opportunity for the clarification you because there's always some opportunity but the average person weights past the point of maximum out opportunity to capitalize on what they've saved right for their retirement\nAnd uh most people don't think you know they come in and uh yeah where where I'm about to retire my last days in three months what can we do and I was like well first off I Wish that we started talking two years ago um\nWe usually do say handout I Would avoid a bag of but the truth\nIs is that if you're about to retire and three months now is the time yeah you know in in ... you may you may after you talk with somebody wish that you'd come in earlier but\nWe live in a society of ah stuff in our face right we got the Internet we've got marketing we've got too much from it yeah too much information and thrown at us all the time and we start to just focus on what seems to be the most urgent\nAnd a lotta times unfortunately for close to retirees people in their fifties coming up uh towards retirement in the next decade or ... dollar Fifteen Twenty years or so\nUm they're not thinking about how do I structure my asset for a day for Fifteen Years from now because there's too many other\nThings they care of right and you know I I was ... philosophical for a moment I was talking to my college student here recently and I was like you know your generation and and really it's it's all generations living today whether you're twenty or ... or eighty you know it doesn't matter you're everybody's been affected by this but this is the first generation being raised like this\nIs for ever it has been who ever has access to the information has the power has to control whoever has the education has the power has the control for the first time in history weren't ... everybody's got access to all the information and it's\nWho can weed through all the junk right and focus on what's important\nAnd and getting back to what you were ... the reason I bring this up because what you were saying is we get so overwhelmed that we don't do anything\nAnd so the thing is whether you're twenty twenty five thirty all the way up to retirement name over the numbers there you go I Want to go through 'em all but or whatever your age is there something about where you're at your life right now with your planning\nThat there's something you should be thinking about planning for so we talk a lot of uh here because a lot of our clients are pre retirement or dirt in retirement um and so we talk a lot\nTargeting towards people who are a little bit older\nBut the truth is if you're young you should be thinking about should I be putting my money into attacks dirt defer to count how should I maximize my four one K. or for three B. if I'm going to\nHow should I be using a Ross versus a traditional i._r._a. or should I be and how does that apply to my situation and and the truth is it's just so much information out there that you can ... if you're smart and you must be an all time educating yourself in this stuff a lot of people can't\nBut we see people come in with about Seventy five percent of the information making really bad decisions yeah because they don't really have the total picture so that's why we just really make it easy for people to sit down and talk to us so we can provide some education and then if you decide to work with us great and if you don't that's fine\nYeah you know I always I always talk about my car so I'm I'm not a card guy I don't know how to work on my car I think I'd be very interested to learn how to work on my car but I'm not going to too many other things there's too many others\nAnd we and we know some guys that are unbelievable out of\nYeah so then you find a good mechanic that you trust that you can come to and say hey this is the sound this piece of junk making what do you think that's it and they'll give you their opinion if they let me let me look under the hood let me get my hands in there and see if I can make sense of it and if I can make sense of it I'll fix it and this is how much it will cost does that sound fair\nAbsolutely it does so youre going to take the weight off my shoulders you're going to make sure that my car that gets me for me to be and gets me there safely is going to get continue to get their me there safely so I can go to my job to make money so I can feed my family yes I'm going to let that mechanic do that for me because I don't know a hundred percent of what I should\nKnow to do that with somebody else yeah so you talked about 'cause we're getting a close on time and we should pick this up next week when we talked about it but you wanted to give some of the good solutions and I don't want us to wrap up\nThe right solution so there are ways you can put plans into place so that you can uh effectively control your tax bill in retirement and it all comes down to the balance between the different types of taxable accounts\nSo most people but most of their money into their IRAs or their four one K. is these tax deferred accounts and then they get to retirement and they look and they say oh my goodness I'm a millionaire\nBut there's a million dollars in tax deferred account which Uncle Sam has so much control and what that same person could have done throughout the years is maybe structured in such a way so that they were building tax free assets tax deferred assets and then their emergency fund and other types of cash more liquid assets\nBut when you have the proper balance in the proper balance is different for everyone everyone though when you add the proper balance you get complete control over your tax bill in retirement\nAnd for some of us we get to live completely tax free and retirement\nAnd you avoid that Social Security becoming tax taxable or at least minimize and yeah\nThat's right so if you want to find out if you can live tax free and retirement and if you can if you want to just make sure that you pay the least amount of taxes and that you have complete control over your taxes in retirement you need to give us a call at six one five for for one twelve Seventy four were\nGranted retirement and tax advisory and you can check us out at clear retirement dot com we'd love to meet

take all we have so watch that's how important this is so I Wonder how you feel about that do you think this will\nPut a dent\nIn those who would go and harassed doctors that do abortions will it's slow them down I don't think so\nHow do you feel about that\nCalifornia's state officials today said that Ross Perot's new party third party has now in fact met the early in stiff requirements to

with very deep pockets the kind of money\nIt would take to run Powell in a race\nSo I guess I'm a pragmatist you know me\nI can read the handwriting on the wall and I know that Pat Buchanan has been winning a lot of a straw polls and that kind of thing but I'm telling you now it will come down to Clinton Dole and I think Powell Powell is going to run\nHow is for all we don't know about and we know a little bit about him now\nHe is pro choice we know that\nWhat else do we know about ... he's a strong leader\nWe know that\nHe's brilliance I think we agree on that\nHe talks about some gun control or sensible gun control laws\nI Would have to hear that define before I Would um be able to make a judgment there but in a number of areas he looks to be a fiscal conservative and a social middle of the rotor\nMoore a Republican than a Democrat but it's getting hard to tell these days you know\nSo if we get a Clinton do Powell race I guess it might begin to be appropriate because I think that's what it's going to be to ask you which way you would be inclined to go so which why would you be inclined to go [laughter] [noise]\nI really think that's where it's going to go Congress

have thought about it believe me or if what seems to be true is true then obviously powers that would do what they are alleged to have done or now seemingly have done because where does a forgery lead you\n\nTo one of two very destructive paths for somebody\nVery powerful and there's been a lot of pressure and there's been a lot of manipulation and I'm no fool I Know what could happen but uh if I don't do it\nThen who is going to Chris Ruddy doesn't do it then who is going to if the Associated Press doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nHave sixty minutes doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nSomebody should and um there are um far\nLess noble things to die for is not is what it comes to then I'm exposing the truth or chasing the truth\nSo there you are\nBack to the lines west of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHow are mourning mourning a you know it's interesting the way the press is covering this thing whether that foster deal when when I was ah in service during\nAh the ah the\nBreaking of the ah Watergate story I was overseas Germany I was reading a European newspapers get more information sure that I was getting out of the magazines that I was describing to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had to doggedly pursue under criticism um the story now that is what is happening here now how long is the ... been in this condition I don't know well is it laziness back\nIn those days I think um you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was doing a because it was the guy to the the spirit of the times in those days was that we leave the president alone the dirty things about the president along go our way back to to uh\nNot not quite true we leave the the woman I sing or the bruising or the personal things yeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny ... public official has been hell has has gotten more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear present where's my\nHair yeah like we're supposed to care as wrong but it was\nInteresting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with the Watergate investigation out because I got it out of a London paper and I got out of the English are printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do with this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore that I I guess maybe according to a lot of reports on getting of the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah this whole thing just thanks pretty badly and has for the whole time I had quite an air to quite there's too many unanswered thanks who pumped into Princeton um there's just I guess at the age of ...\nThat's her questions like who was it that bumped on the back of ... will always be the unanswered question you know and who was that a late that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and fail you know as Nixon did nobody wants nobody wants that for American nobody in their right mind could want that\nAnd I know on clay feet\nI Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but ... you know as I'm close to the taste or as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nUm do we are we still the country we once were do we still pursue the truth or do we not care anymore and I guess we'll find out by finding out how many people call up the Associated Press apps area code too old to\nHad flown down to LA to ticket can remove the powder that was put out there [laughter] yeah so did you hear about that no economic\nCalled toll free one eight hundred six one eight eight to five five\nAnd he's making a good movie\nOh well I'm sure than a ... organization being very sensitive to that sort of saying I'm there will be repercussions but I I was very interesting um\nBut I Can't let I'll tell you\nWhat let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right\nYes All right it's a very interesting guy because kidney fan ...\nWell I I can I I I Will know what their stance would be ma'am thank you let me please investigate that story before I ... a because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down on your word but should you be wrong about something like that\nUh there would be very serious a legal repercussions\nSo let me find out about that but even if true or is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm\nNot significant compared to what Chris Ruddy a seems to have come up with here\n\nYou know Charlie's reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's going to be typical of the liberals\nAnd I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nSimply going after this president and maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind of the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk it away by saying that it's I'm a conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals\nA great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised [noise] first time caller line you're on the air I hello I can barely hear you there you're gonna have to get into the phone and shout out is\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am\nAnd that last night or someone Carter was that the um hay on Bob\n... comment yes right and they said if he fell off it did yes\nAh oh I don't think you mentioned that last night with kid there are\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked will we get a warning\nI did well well I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a comet where to hit earth would we know about it yeah\nWell I'm On a April twenty third on your program can't plan what Helen\nYes and hear the\nTopic was Catholic [noise] ... I think yes correct\nAnd he said that the boy the end no warning with the great act of mercy and now by car would appear and the guy that might have out there\nUm well All right thank you it may be ma'am it may be\nAnd uh there was interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the a piece that broke off which by the way is not in the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a\nSpiral um and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comet or somebody worried [laughter]\nIt is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off at you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is your break off ... and you've got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright\nThe question the good question is why is it bright at All right now in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or a piece that breaks off there should not be enough energy from the sun\nTo be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question or Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program\nFriday night Saturday morning he's got a lot to say I'm not so much about the common but we will again to ask you about that because there must be energy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see\nAnd where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning are Tim calling from picking 'em uh the lady just called out too long ago yeah thought the\n[noise] but I think I don't produce or director outer yet\nAt the true story I've got a copy of the store right here by an Associated Press writer uh-huh and the newspaper to chose them I'm sure the young man picketing in the theater or at the\nEnd do me would you do me a big favor yeah would you facts that to me\nI'm not able to because\nAll right I'm then fine let me just ask that somebody said to me and I guarantee they will and as soon as they do we'll talk about it okay how's that sounds good right so somebody out there with a fax machine God Knows we've sold enough of them\nA fax me that article and I'm Glad to cover it I just want to be very careful very cautious I'm sure it's totally on\nThe up and up [noise] but [noise]\nThe allegation involved is very serious allegation and um [noise] I Want to be careful and a half my ducks in a row before I open my big mouth [noise] having said that we will be back in\nAs saying the minister Louis Farrakhan leader of the million Man March in Washington DC told a stunned the crowd at a Washington Baptist church the march was inspired by an extra terrestrial vision he had ten years ago\nA UFO he said swept him off to a space ship where the late ... larger Mohammed told him the president Ronald Reagan was plotting a war\nFarrah Khan was then beamed back to earth you said quote I really don't care if you think I'm nuts and quote he told the church without elaborating on how his vision was connected to the march\nWow\nWell maybe I'd been pursuing Louis Farrakhan as a guest in the wrong way and maybe he would respond to an invitation to dreamland [laughter] what do you think\nAre the Vince Foster situation and I think this is good advice for everybody\nHe says if the truth shell set us free than a lie whether blatant or sin of omission she'll keep us bound prisoners of those who would have us in darkness and ignorance so they can continue to control\nThe Vince Foster a scandal could very well be the tip of an iceberg when further investigated could revealed to the American people that our government is built on a mountain of lies\nWhen given the truth history has demonstrated that people will rise up even in the face of the greatest adversity in danger to preserve the human spirit Republican or Democrat conservative or liberal female or male young or old\nWe deserve to be told the truth\nMost sincerely is your program appreciated by this one signed is a Dora there is a name for you in San Diego well is that is exactly the way I feel about it I'm not afraid of the truth\n\nI'm just not afraid of it and I'm not afraid of where it leads and you may or may not have noticed this about me yet but I Do not respond to individual items presented to me it is a logically\nI just don't I respond to them I Hope uh directly in pragmatically um\nAnd examine each one for it's worse I don't in other words I don't I Do have I Am basically ... fairly moderate conservative\nBut I'm not a reactionary I look at each thing as it comes along and I'm not afraid of the truth I'm just not and if it ever gets to the point where I Am then I Need to walk away from this job and I'm not going to do that until it gets in and hopefully it never does\n\nI mean if I had to come on here and in effect serve my masters you know whoever they might be\nI couldn't do it\nI'll just leave it at that I you know I'll just leave it at that I couldn't do it and wouldn't do it\n\nIt's not what this job is all about at least not for me\nOkay east of the Rockies you're on the air high\nArt I'm flattered job yet on I saw him on sixty minutes\nYou're talking about Chris Ruddy\nUnlike the term I look I got ... everybody's got a conspiracy theories out there right I mean you've got to admit it's pretty uh pretty funny\nUm I saw the peace yes and um then they not only debunked him sir but they left or the better part of them on the cutting room floor they took words out of his sentences

opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I it you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize\nThat uh that that\nThere are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that fell on the

been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ... deserves it just your great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book right has very little to do with any of the other versions\nOf the ... house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions with a slightly changed the title\nA but it was it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but they just it's that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting appeal house on Netflix um is is just one of the rare or the Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch his loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the

there's plenty to you know give you a ... but I mean there were some moments there where some of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid

great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population using under about fifty thousand balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just is like is\nIt I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this\nTobar you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or to call a tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but the other but the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so did you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down roads and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that it actually around the only other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance the er the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over a hundred people were like using the grave as you know picnic\nTables and climbing on them and doing all kinds of\nBad stuff to an actual historical artifacts that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar in federal party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start heading the train and start having their cars so it's\nReally we made at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight around an alley\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly\nAnd how it is choose mainstream you know notions of what sensationalism means\nStories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses\nEmotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press or there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call and letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules never one rule was that any\nTrue crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer worked a fetish ties the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice\nAnd on a day when eleven people are dead in a synagogue where they should have been saying the ... and not run for your life\nBy all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell in the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right\nIntent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well I'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rest some of the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true there's many other stories in the ...\nThis this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy\nIf everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you\nWhenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about uh people who you believed to be guilty of some thing stave victims centric in the stories that you tell\nAnd not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that\nThey um [noise] there's oh they're clear your graphic pattern and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curse just north of Portland or so that that would be a link between them the ah\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve but the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um\nUh\nThe uh by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and break through his head and I had been achieved that had been done to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and I had a very infant pile stage\nTo men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story than required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had\nBeen a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen eleven Nineteen twelve which\nWould runner and he was killing a lot of people\nBut the earlier crimes we what we did was say look this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Nineteen alive and there have to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow I'm getting audited walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got ... nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year or so successfully\nNominal luck and it is not all of them are ... I had told my daughter that ... if\nYou walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen they read his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky and that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable\nHow many points that first murder matches up with\nAgainst the uh with uh with with the last ... last murders and the series so are we is just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but\nWe found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it\nBecause it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crush on him and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successive Lee after that\nIt is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was\nCarrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the ah I think that he well he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house\nWas shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what he was trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn\nAbout the human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answered the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they\nCome from the parts of our of our ourselves that we don't like to talk about\nA all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey they\nAre part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves\nThat we are ashamed of the uh uh that's\nThat's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime bucks by the way the last book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um [noise] ... ah I Believe it's Weinstein I could have a lifetime\nOr the or I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there was surely going to be safe\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the white American ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nIdling hang on to that thought on crime stories as this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed at ... am this is the incentive\nTo go with one goal in mind to help people like you

in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\nOr the other thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about gun normally talk about\nAnd the man trying I didn't make a deliberate and thought oh entry into the subject I just got her like a\nA I was I was a documentary\nAbout the murders and all those guys were called ... it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively our beer ... murders are a part of a series so I started going to put an hour and to and you're trying to learn more about the ferries but the the our became [noise]\nWe can do the weak eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime book sure yes it is yeah\nYou know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime [noise] you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution\nThen we try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd it became it became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in even though it's a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this just lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they have it happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime\nHere and always believed that uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nAlways believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book back in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief twelve\nYeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about it but it was it was a show\nHe said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow\nI I don't know why it was important to him too well\nI understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it I'm punished I I I don't know if there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is a all all ... all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is\nIs trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occurred in\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the story was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery or what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live a ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small town of hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they let die terrible bath\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh contexts\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that trait that point you're just back there and that has to do with the the taco in the case of taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck co ... had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors and Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSo yeah ... it's it's a tiny detail\nThat you would right that would not never survive\nI mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that the tally in American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important than a crime story that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know that I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on an item of Jim nine Nineteen twelve oh the\nThe lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nA dispute between the ... city council and the power company so they had city lights and street lights but they were out and ... and the town was in complete darkness or the Sunday night there was a church service\nOne of the national trade crimes are the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and what not an adjoining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now\nThe people that area's still remember it still they they could tell that the house right there um it still it has not forgotten or many

I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because\nThere's an obvious lack of planning and I'm preparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I\nJust very much would suspect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a a while he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and he says he ... his the documentation\nOf his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents Sherman about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\n[noise] but it still isn't that that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then ... what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know they it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not um [noise] he he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear of over ... you know norm do not have normal fear\nAnd one thing the apparent about this the ... the demands on the train is that from his crimes is it ... it was not it was not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with his for so long I\nThis is probably not that I should have made this this other point first the story of a Paul Miller on the map from the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about\nHim in ten years or Fifteen\nGoing to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nAh this this crime and it when that guy Illinois and [laughter] and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be ride but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity is so we moved on and printed the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interesting a Bill James you really you take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone

you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was tenor and blogger but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know it means like even today we don't think about those people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks it\nUm I've got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence from a ... like one of the act\nOf every what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the less murders were committed they ah it it's still it's still around and and the has been presented with a guide to the to the murders and\nThe uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know what this call will Gary ...\nNo we don't it disappeared ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured I figured he might have worked for the world rode out he got to every place that it did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might like we should that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... what ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal ... murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed a if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to\nThe um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working I'm self into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lot of stocking\nBut uh the uh just working on solving the frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one\nAnd this here that was part of his criminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so ... if his crime and the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and place followed his where he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad yeah when\nI was used at the intersection of two railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night they could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to we'll road your last chance a year there'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to compare\nYeah this is actually not really never got what about you\nKnow that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered next to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it's the the train no longer exist\nAnd then the lynching piece which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police those are the other questions you have a chance to

Chicago\nAnd ah [noise] along the shore on this one particular train ride and I came in and out of this yard um they had four or five of these ah ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed and they found out that they were all killed by\nActresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains and there was I Believe a total of five bodies found\nAnd um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and looks at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly\nTill he white you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly what it is not Chicago attached to Cleveland the Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that the\nCase you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness or after the uh what was hired to try to solve a series of a ... and I'm\nBlanking out on the name by which the yeah prizes\nCrime series is now and they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread to Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of crimes at some length\nIn in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... they were they were axe murderer as they were connected to train the but it it's\nTwenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it's not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that he would um I I I I knew the case you

it was great working with you so so a couple of news stories to get to this morning I don't know if you heard about a ... ... if you go to coast to coast am dot com there's there is a really ... is a great piece\nAbout the experiments that inspired Frankenstein so as you're heading into\nThe holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way this\nIs a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction story that people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction\nYou know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play but it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling science fiction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like it was like\nA I robot both the ... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in that very first\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that is created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties\nA sit down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding of life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot com it's a great story to read and and

Juanita\nYes please thank you\nHoney the Jennings is the ah the ... the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell\nNew Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar the subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you read this great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides\nOn a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts\nThey do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually um any on Halloween just how in itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month it's in the quarter million so it's a massive amount of people for that small city to have that its borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications of the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important to me and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize\nThat are ... that\nThere are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try to tell people that film wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America you're the victim was in Connecticut in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims\nInjuries but we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that\nThey keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nThe honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being executed for being which is the strange thing about that to me of course all of a seasonal planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that she's with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nAnd the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to\nAnd then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that

...\nBut in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was um Stephen King praised it a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ended deserves it it's just a great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight has very little to do with any of the other versions of the ... house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions were these slightly changed the title\nA but it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting of hill house on Netflix\nIs is just one of the rare or Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch his loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think was even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie\nIs that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I go to handle it if I had seen it so they look for that and you're going to do that for Halloween you're going to enjoy the show to for Halloween a season with the
