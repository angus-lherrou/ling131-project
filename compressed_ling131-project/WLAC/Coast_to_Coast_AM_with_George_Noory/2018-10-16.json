[noise]\nAnd um I could hardly see the players when they the ... started the England played Scotland but I heard the match in my headphones and then suddenly I hear that Gary McAllister who was the the strike her you know the guy who strike who puts in goals most\nGets a penalty which means that Ninety percent they would score Scotland would score a goal in from the helicopter believe it or not I move the bone away from his foot\nOff the ball down ice cream in the helicopter one two three move and the bold moves away this has been documented by the BBC filmed\nAnd if you get on my Web site go to those those Eighteen most fascinating moments in ... in British history or football you'll see the ball moving away [noise]\nSo you can imagine the next day I received thousands and thousands of hate letters and emails from Scott\nHelps corps yeah they want and they wanted you on this one [laughter]\nYeah you know it's okay to inspire and motivate the team but he seemed to fear and move it boiled away we the power of their mind is in no no it's actually illegal\nSo I had to give back something to do the Scottish people so I decided to buy a Scottish island which makes me kind of parts companies\nAll right have they have they welcomed with open arms again\nOh yes yes yes now this and\nThis this island it's called ... island\nAnd it's it's ... it's very mysterious and and the ... it's it's um it's first first of all I don't even know how to start but it it's the island is it like a volcanic out quote in their first in forth which is north of Denver\nAnd um it is of of scientific interest this is why it was quite surprised and actually shocked that scope and sold me the island that I could buy the island because\nIt's a it mirrors not listened to this it mirrors the great pyramids of Scotland which mirror they lay out of\nThe pyramids of Giza while\nCairo and I'm fascinated by the connection between the pyramids in these islands\nUm looked you know I I was in there so it's very hard for me to decipher exactly what what occurred but I can tell you is is\nThat we were driving in the Sinai Desert I'm Talking about now in Nineteen Seventy and like you we so a ship in in the middle of a daylight and there was this motionless\nHanging in the sky and only isolate ... so the driver and the noise and another soldier sitting behind me\nNo one else soy incredible\nSo it's very difficult to know whether he was an alien craft or was it some kind of a government vehicle because you know the government study um extraterrestrial intelligence they they know they exist a ghost George you at countless and countless of radio shows about area feast\nOh my God yeah and I'm sure you interviewed Annie Jacobsen ...\nWriter she's a Pulitzer nominee and she wrote about it she wrote a book recently called phenomena and which I urge people to read [noise] uh\nBut I make huge believe or an extra tourists you life if you ... you know if you ask if you make your poll right now in America and you are how many people believe in UFOs I think it'll be like sixty Seventy eighty percent because we see them now I haven't\nSeen an alien in front of me but um my friend was John Lennon and um\nHold on my right there in the early ... will get that story with John Lennon in you when we come back we'll do the uh exercise with the clock and watches and that will wrap up what's final phone calls next on coast to coast they\nSigned up now for ... zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com\n... nobody will eat the gum on your smartphone with the IRA radio ads [noise]\nToday learn more about the W.

in award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch has a very popular Boyce of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here\nI'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've cross this book and I'm very grateful to\nThe chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\nYou know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was tried that that just one more try and that's really been my and form a motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club [laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group [laughter] side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith Sam says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group to the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing to be\nIt was during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things than they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this offensive just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits and the invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are positive I Believe that if\nYou walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything\nThat you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles of my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some lives is this similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she can be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf other ... before you came on and he uses that he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved it and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law items when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I have and when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know Edgar Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class and it ... or or type pin and he lost it and you can find it and he was telling a story about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping\nAnd it was the tight class that that fell on the ground it and came out of nowhere the\nOther part of it the the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing these are the ... in there for that [laughter] it's\nAmazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put exes on other people\nAnd in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum and\nMy contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project a negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else\nIf he or she could not get rebounds tea is so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nEvil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight

been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals\nAnd I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms\nOf your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these\nAre things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent but sometimes you share these things with other people and they'll roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve\nRemain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive expressed thinks that's a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the the important thing is to do it with consistency\nIs to do it with silence and us to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism\nThey become an enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nailed down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true in the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle glide the\nMiracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me\nAnd I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it on my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could sign that you can folded laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card a designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're gonna take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories\nIt it is overwhelming you\nKnow we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life we also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there\nAre in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable\nCircumstance so that it will come back with calls next

writing down a goal in and going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it\nSomething will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\n[noise] interesting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put this together or did you do this all on your own\nToll on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition of things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are striving for all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles story that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend in New England who was recovering\nFrom a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left\nTo his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believing\nYes and loved though yeah\nAnd my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happened to narrate he\nListened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss who said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\n...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's exactly what the experience and was quite recent that when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up with these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take and twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you absolutely\nAbsolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all enter this wonderful drowsy but still conscious and cognizant state just before we fall asleep at night\nAn act in image in your mind enact a scene that's something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen and acted as if you're in it if you want to climb a ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder like climb climb you know really feel those wrongs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple thing and then run that seeing through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders and you always need to bring it back\nIf you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you got a promotion at work\nIn time and time that will Congress ties into reality it may be in ways that you don't expect it may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it will occur stick with it your assumptions harden into fact eventually\nLet's go east of the Rockies to begin Joe when
