June ... good way out there but they had narrowed down the focus so he has the liberal elite going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is\nAstronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the solution is up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent infrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because we don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big\nAreas of the sky at once once we find planet no and looking at it in the infrared to study it will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see once we know exactly what looks I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably\nYou know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or\nNot they were inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter\nSaturn but in ... when we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has all of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of ...\nYou've been living with this now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than tuned into it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's

we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something

was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the ... report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nations the United states included\nMy adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and Nick celebrating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on my guess is that the politicians assume that\nThe problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices than they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem I ... or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast right on the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their cities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got\n... of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees\nAs you grow up to two degrees and that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low not choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing now in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that\nWhich led to a lot of the crises\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut it has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken\nRoot now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we do is for years ago\nTo global climate change in increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the\nSummer of twenty Eighteen million for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that\nThe forty eight continental US state for it and now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth homes Whoopi risking the title flooding\nThe researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida\nWell have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already one of the big secret a cap in Miami by the political institution there\nAnd they get flooding constantly on for months and they get constantly flooding on high tides that get constantly\nFlooding all of the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and Mary saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami nonsense\nThat got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic\nHad melted two to three times faster than the computer projection or charge when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster\nIf Florida had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that didn't mean that most of the southern tip of Florida will be uninhabitable\nAnd that leads back to what ... professor drew shall we say\nWe're going to have more with Linda in just a moment on coast to coast am so don't touch your

around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight\nIn front of a computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just to three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on three category the first had to do with the very distressing subject of half cat had a cat\nAround the world was\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspot seller observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatory is computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an air force base that down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then third update\nHad evolved from my asking my or fires YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of flooding out of body\nTypically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sat me that was slowed down it was weird uh I sent the puzzle to a fighter shot a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was ever on a ... like something coming through the window and the top of a book show and he did a video that you can see right now all of this\nAt uh my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ...\nI Do not know this is the extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mention any of the parents to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear\nTook place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIs provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now\nIs Charles hazards\nAre talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand and age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature so\nAt the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired so after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the covers of them myself and just lay there and looked outside\nThe leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with huge stars that I can see and then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window\nI can see this misty gray ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looks like it's coming right for my head and I was just frozen with fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead\nI could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a gloves\nPassing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing\nThat was surrounding made and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that and been asked out millennia and they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nAnd you describe the shape of a high resolution that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tell him possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitch were almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see ... but they had the same texture and the fall and good would shadow in life\nBut they were limited says the same time and they would just float by me but kind of neat at the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like an downloaded information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was beginning\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall misinformation because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any subject in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may be cousin my past
