economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nI Hope they're releasing those trees or are they oh I don't I don't know [laughter] I Hope so yeah I I'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful manner very ecological manner\nI mean that's that would create another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of the men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\nYeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in the last school it's Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really isn't that high on that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said let's say you want you you wanna hassle of women there so you don't do it but what you have to take into consideration is is that women\nAre going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions and they're going to want us\nAll excellent and was absolutely excellent once and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born ... being going right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y they that they are going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents\nOf Gen Z a but it's what we're watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are not that I'm hearing about them and he said let's let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like [noise]\nThe hippies that everybody hated as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that and\nI don't care listen it is what it is [laughter]\nWell let's listen here here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want what you want to you want it now you don't you want to free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative [laughter]\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just here about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\n[noise] [noise] yeah what he told me that makes me cringe you\nKnow this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible\nYeah it it troubles me early does we maybe not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have the enlisted I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think or Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter suck that it would be used for tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know if\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow [noise] no

know why don't we run our [noise] our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a\nConstitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that\nYeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no you know we were just taking all do we have removed the rules but what we've taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what\nWill what's going on with China [noise] China's enter freaky position China right now are

policies they did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies and I bought his adult\nThey're not buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing now and it's this is a real number\nFive hundred million people that were born five hundred million\nSo here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big income and have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've

a woman I wanted to see two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the foreign star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he would run and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys said and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or tried to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has kids\nEspecially a little one still at home and that little one but a young white and ... and his wife and we had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was a fork and with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did as if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school

in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\nWell regarding running the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country\nA period is corruption and\nThe business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works we're we're the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving one I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat well but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I commented on his tweeting too because I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf you let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise]\nUh I I don't know I think what he has done is dignify\nAt the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nI really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\n\nCoast to coast am on TALK radio Fifteen ten ... oh\nThey're working for the insurance company to

from my perspective it's an exciting time to be alive it really is\nI I'm I'm enjoying this I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that that's going to be a just launched by\nGeneration y that this monster generation of fourteen to thirty three years old and it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and automobiles\nLike the old days\nYeah incident like in in talking to the you know I talked to all sectors and talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves are not going to happen\nGood good they already killed some old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks and I really don't have\nEnough truck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has a little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a heart ride and I'm thinking to myself I the first

rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck has park there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nArguing how's how's how's the driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military\nYeah and that it's there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens\nWhen you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ...\nI just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need their oil\nWe've got water\nYeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nI don't want to lose always missiles though guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim\nJong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I say I said what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that oh yeah it's got like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist group that changed the new ... or something like that and they do it and try and planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that the one child for a couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population\nYou can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level\nFertility Michael in Jamestown North Carolina

course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for survey my friend I really appreciate that well\nUh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love the show\nI'm looking forward to this this is as you you got to tell you I mean with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd ah I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to\nFinally put these all these experiences together into a book and a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but ah to students and actually I I teach a class now the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was um a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you\nKnow that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had\nThe in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian or but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it\nBut a reluctance to uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rate and who's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he's set their Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty five zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so\nThat's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there is only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it\nBut I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcasts there's out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce olive sold ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things\nAh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there\nThe background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it in the last couple of years that's\nHas been the the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally stiff I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because\nSometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then\nIn in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence\n... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my\nMother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic\nRight to see 'em there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry boat or there was no bridge you had to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and then that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nYou know that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God I'm so it so I I I ... that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passed in the north end to would be island there is a way to bridge bands that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and\nI was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for the\n... ... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then\nEverything was I was just like suspended in in in in in ... there was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in the warm and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom\nLike in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching your ... there's a there's some helpers out there
