O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carpet and cast says we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released into the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the up soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in most places there is a north\nOf Mel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um [noise] but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be Tara formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country\nBut the Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia does really pushing it space program which I mean they want you as soon as I as a and they bring us back\nA rumble set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a a private space launch companies but allowing space lunch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast the\nLineup no go zone or read email newsletter today it goes to goes to um done um\nSell more alive but I think if I let her get out their sales email for credit card again like you know I Need to stay safe secure that download my warm sorts and get your free [noise] this is talk\nRadio Fifteen ten W well ac [noise]\n\n\nWon't go back to coast to coast Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to your calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nUm I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm\nUm they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again I'm ...\nThere's a new paradigm now and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't do and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent wants Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power much right\nOr you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGoing Rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state\nBut it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ...\nA different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise] um [noise]\nIt's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right\nAnd um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars\nIt will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go\nAnd um you know the ... the once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know do [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets but\nUm if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds a fake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know and that rocket is the oxygen and it's not\nTo feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows or the you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah\nYou know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very\nHigh velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show like\nHey I'm I'm enjoying the show the light is\nAnd the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering and William fleet yet there if we find someone and tell us your life do we really have the right to invade like America deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right ah well here's the thing um [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say ah for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America\nBut on Mars there are new

twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow\nPeople to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because of mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now\nOr it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims to people could get a exploration missions finance mine asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable

can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster\nI'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake

section about while\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on E. and maps environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy got shot at a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a very psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually I actually got a day job and then I studied psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that\n[laughter] how'd you do by the way\nNot very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when Tony apple is for a year in the at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teamed up their sports why\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brant\n[noise] well you know I I have a degree in psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied um basically environmental sensitivity and goats counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a go study and you know I'm sure you're listening to your show no it's no mystery that scientists sort of dropped when it comes to explaining goes by encounter\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away if it was an Asian Asian overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying and counter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things OR Books with more than just go stories location outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just don't you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cost\nSo these throwing encounters um it's the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these ghosts I've been taking our interests for millions of years and it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes over conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's when I came out with a book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts\nAnd I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with\nA book well then you bring a dose of real science to the picture you know I think that's important yeah\nYeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just gotta look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangle man and non locality and how electricity affects us and um and what it does outside the body so\nThere's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article what kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded to brag about what the grossly experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a\nMajority of the ghost encounters there that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to goes counters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there is some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by side based view on goes so that's um inside is basically um\nTelepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that a lot of goes link counters that happen out there\nUm the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in\nBeing real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book go over um what I call a a tele path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way to counter\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters\nOr so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it's sort of there's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um you know emotional\nDistress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else and and a great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt\nPassed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying ah to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter]\nI there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity alright and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com

legit I had an experience I'm\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd I'm a ... one morning I'm Me and my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratch and they get outside so I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know and I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to follow through with this so I open the door the dog and me went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I thought something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running\nIt was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in\nTheir lives you know I dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I find myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept that asking myself\nWhat what happened and what made that day different and was there some sort of like distress signal sent to me with the cat and distressing they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many paranormal experiences occur Brandon because the person who\nDied who comes back\nNever had some unfinished business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghost encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like a staff of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these motions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe

experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the things I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and perhaps\nThese bereavement operations er visits from the thief shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way the\nProcess of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased couldn't help let's move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and ... ... and when I talk to those these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after the

something or yeah yeah exactly\nYou know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing if this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing ... FM our eyes and eat jeeze\nAnd what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of objective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can't\nYou know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout um our eyes as well so you you you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that\nDoesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back ... take phone calls get another couple of stories of some of your studies when we come back\n... two nights just log on to ... dot com [noise]\nThe country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors\nAll on your schedule one open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in Salt leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more checks crowd to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P R O U D to seven nine six four or five\nStar to your online NBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

his worst scientific work that goes studies what are your colleagues say about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] um [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you um wrote a book about ghosts and are interested in plug for the inside most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and I don't think\nThey do and I was really shocked that you know 'cause you're kind of sit back and kind of weight when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive\nYou know there's a there's still some colleagues who will come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they you know follow it up with but you can't tell anyone or anything like that\nBut the response has been pretty positive I'm you know if it's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for human since you know the dawn of time\nYou know does this go stuff um so ... you\nKnow it's not that bizarre or out of context\nAnd listen I mean parents college he is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline just like social psychology and narrow psychology\nIt's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university they are the ones the clone sheep and a nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's\nYou know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled ... brand and you don't have the answers you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nPoultry guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says we're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on and those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're um in distress um you know to me it's hard to\nFathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nMore new girls seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right without warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who\nAm I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child stating my accent died the night before unexpectedly\nHis death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of a lot of the year ... phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional stiffs related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a\nHell of Patrick distress message to his ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but it also bags that question you know was this did this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do this well\nOh yeah yeah I\nIt's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal um or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be you know was the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think the electricity comes from you know posters and street lamps and things like that but you\nKnow electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well an animal's sure does ... you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because lectures that he is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience an aberration a poultry guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic fields are always present as well\nSince the first go counter ever\nUm you know it and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked now there is some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating maps can actually cause a ghostly encounters\nUm you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that a ghost is president\nYou know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously\nThe fast food goes uh whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher or you can probably say well that's a dishwasher right\nUm so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with goes laying out or even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know\nUh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up for I felt the room felt Energizer like there was it felt like a
