S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants your old down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution and really is not accurate the\nNations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn it a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are\nAre they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or ... ... email newsletter get it today at ... dot com\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the ...\nDon't miss the accounting for\nWe watch our must be I our radio music festival this Sunday and Monday Night at seven pm\nOn cw fifty a It's Wednesday\nOctober third one new today on the free our radio\nIn the home all the best ... station all in one athlete to rocked up maybe play last doctor's blog ... and the radio original vital experience\n\nConfessions of a potentially perfect parent brought to you by about those kids dot org\n...

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the humming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with\nYellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their young to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks in that it flows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was that are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] [noise] yeah okay this external thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll eggs and they'll make you\nStill do one thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to say you were were\nTalking about wind bills when I when\nI was living in Oregon okay\nAnd I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty more bought booth\nPlane you know they were were burning off the methane\nGas well we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know Christianity\nNow come back and they had no no no ... going to cost too much I can add anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some places matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas or they also want to get methane from water\nTreatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext on let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having stepmom you're stuck into smoking to him several times are hurting on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past\nAnd I think we should warn are good friends she not than they are the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are are are using a ...

tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nUh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big port on in in a northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a mention I perhaps where a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThere are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of\nTemperance Chambliss harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual\nWeather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting you can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex which have our with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce IQ\nBruce of some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nOh well let's go man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe that the way that is being gay oh engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on a show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blogging out son well people are so much hit you weren't hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to the street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want or again that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish I may never come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that\nHere's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing a stripping the oil from industrial nations away describing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sit there with her sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play the oh I can now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed

like and it into the living room with an old friend\nYou have my friend just as a I'm looking forward to this you got to tell us about this a young age encounter with big for what happened\nWell I'd never had an encounter with big foot uh my first ah a realization of the character came with the the Patty film probably somewhere in the late sixties early seventies ha ha and um I've had other encounters in my life but not with the ah the hairy men\nAnd after I saw that I said to myself my God this type\nOf thing is roaming around North America and ah unlike other people who thought it was a hoax and still do to this day\nI was a I was sold on it from the beginning I just said to myself this thing is real it's out there and ah these fellows or have seen it and got in on film\nYou convince people William or seeing something very strange and unusual they're not making up these stories some things out there and there's somebody on a creature\nI have no doubt about it George and are based on um the encounters into testimonies if you think about it\nWhat would make a husband and wife sell the home that day love if they hadn't had something that scare them off the land exactly\nUh what makes a hunter sellers gun collection and vowed that he'll never enter into the woods again after having encountered\nA something in the forest [noise] uh to me is everybody a lying is everybody out of their mind I don't think so I think these people are having real uh encounters a in most cases they've been frightened half out of their wits\nAnd uh for as far as everybody else is concerned uh everything's a hoax right from the get go\nWell will come up with a number of different theories and what we all think big foot might be we'll take calls next hour I'm gonna ask you this because I was raised Catholic what is it a Catholic blogger where do you do\nWell basically I uh talk about the things that I Believe a troubling mankind and uh try to get to the bottom of the heart of the matter if you will um [noise]\nUh the things that plague us you know the things that are troubling people in life and living and marriage and and work and uh try to expose these proves to the individuals by using my blog and I I don't ...\nI'm a ... you know I'm not on the blog every day I kind of blog is ... and to do so\nAnd I'm I'm getting some good feedback from it you know people seem to enjoy it\nAnd um and pretty much that that you know I mean I think we all have a responsibility to have a voice in this life uh especially if it's for the good of you know what I mean that's why you appreciate the coast to coast you know I've been in and inside for a long time\nWell thank you and I'm when I'm at my desk at work I have a little I taught and one of my abs is coast or what is he listening to [laughter]\nExactly you know people are always ah getting your near what is that what are you listening to over there and uh I I tell them so I tried to promote the show as much as I can\nOnly school think he is a tough being a blonde gr ... religion and spirituality and also a believer that there's a creature out there we all called big foot\nNo not at all to me um as as far as a big foot goes as far as you of phones go as far as angels go you can\nPick the topic um\nI Believe all of these things for me for the both of my faith you look at the universe is just a vast and wanting to research thing and ah even our own planet continues to amazing baffle us with the discovery is being made day in and day out and if you just think about something like the dinosaurs\nFor a moment or if it wasn't for one guy who is out there looking around and places where your normal person does not seeing a bone hanging out of a hillside mhm\nWe wouldn't really know about them but we know from even books like Michael ... book forbid knock allergy there have been a\nPeople of civilizations or animal life here will be for us and yet we're given the account biblical leave from Adam and Eve on wood so to me it's a test of the uh what do you believe what I'm giving you from this point forward in spite of knowing what we were going to discover after the fact\nSpeaking the books I got from you too small human some books just on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me you're originals\nWell here's what happened in Georgia in this kind of humor is um when you produce that had

don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time to call\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rush for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will only seen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and a Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea um I have a Sanders since book the bomb real role a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading uh an encyclopedia\nOn the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around

uh uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get in Oklahoma ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and follows in big could encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of the ... called the ... falls incident but one night I'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys got all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike\nSee what it was like a navigating around in the dark ...\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night for the ICC\nWell when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one or the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance of light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this things started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where
