so how would that be done\n[noise] uh the answer is yes however let me uh [noise] uh [noise] say that that type of uh work or is sometimes achieved much more easily\nOr by some other disciplines oh I've I've said that a remote viewing\nYou're you're not talking about bar hopping like\nOh no [laughter] uh\nUh as far as the the disciplines prepare psychology or if\nYou if you're trying to learn remote viewing in order to get in touch with the universe or your higher self or it's sort of like joined in the Marines to learn how to fold your clothes\n[laughter] oh it's a\nIt's extremely disciplined and uh they're easier and sometimes even quicker ways to ways to do it\nOn All right um I don't want to tell everybody once again that are on my website W.

well ac [noise]\nAll right well here's a question from Ross in California and it's a neat one uh please ask when if he has ever targeted the period of time in which the dinosaurs roamed verse\n[noise] uh not personally oh that is a I'm a fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training um\nYou know just as a as another uh\nA session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that\nWell there was a there is the second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr I don't remember specifically good in that I have always felt that a a form of a man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from the remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done a simple archaeological ...\nAnd then you feel good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers\nWin lotteries and um before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't re most humorous [laughter] but you answer the way you want when\nAll right we have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing cold alternate I mean I'm\nI'm a A R B a alternate remote viewing [noise] uh which a substitute ... remote viewing targets for the numbers\nOh and a allows you to a remote view for instance to pick three no the way the ... normally done is if you are doing to pick three\nYou have a four people working at a three viewers\nEach of which were remote view one of the numbers and one person who collect the data looks from the church to see what the results Maine and goes and places Tibet off um but it it it's been done and uh oh it's been done successfully\nWell if remote influencing as possible how about sending ed McMahon and the gang up my driveway\nWell do you help people like this the ...\nAh yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance and for many other reasons as well or if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen\nI Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh uh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to show and so\nYes I'm I Will tell them\nPartially because I I Want the cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity that oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nAlright ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case you can't have your son contact him\nThere aren't there and it's been ... years ...\nYes but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now we worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years\nAnd uh and on the results of our ah our session a Mel Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding\nAre I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can\nI get a hold of lean\nOkay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nUh do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume and she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest a address to remember is art bell dot com and uh right there's a link to my page and on the pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with the computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time we are heavily backed up with a sign witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so\nUm oh I Hope people won't be offended if um you know if they call and uh have their police department call as well and uh nothing is done that day ah we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning I'm I cried for a long track all they care to cover up a fake right All right\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nExactly a absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much\nA does a session on a target and they're wrong ... out of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to end deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes there'll be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show Drake effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote via correctly\nThe more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encourage excuse me incorrectly ...\nAnd uh this is my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there\nOh that I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder lake effect just a you know the hundred monkey a Fisher a just a almost destroyed any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released that are very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can\nUh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it ... and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen more coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sun has to be up back there huh\nYes uh looking out the window it is uh-huh [laughter]\nAll right my friend while I suspect you're going to have a lot of emails to answer and uh this will keep you busy for a while it has been a distinct pleasure Lynn and we will do it again one day of her eyes for it\nI really enjoyed it uh I don't get the art bell show because I live in a very steep little valley and our local radio station has the water's edge of a light bulb handled uh I've really enjoyed this\nThank you in your hair

learn some things tonight as we go so our first guest here\nNever been on pills before\nBenjamin Radford calling been or at least I'm going to Colombian he signed those emails Ben ah one of the world's few science based paranormal investigators he's done a firsthand research into all the different phenomenon and this is cool he's been all over\nI don't know how he's getting to do this because there's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well ask him about that that he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kind of staff psyche goes on houses ... miracle that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about miracles but also big lake monsters and you know a lot of things like that UFOs reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving mysteries um the Santa Fe court house goes into thousand seven\nUh also will have to ask you about that you\n... Cabrera and twenty can he he knows a whole lot about creeping clowns he calls them bad clowns I'll call them creepy clouds they are bad clowns and he's the first of all to fully examined\nThe evil

about ... ... ... you know three hundred sixty five days out of the year right\nSo uh we're going to get some we're going to get where they can learn about the origins Halloween\nAnd uh I just really cool to meet him because he's been all over and you know he's been all over television as well and he does like to keep it science may so let's bring him on here\nFor the first time ever on ... welcome Dan to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm doing well thanks for having me I I Love will if we need to trademark that that's great\nI Know right I should have went over there and check out the domain hurry up get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right\nOff of it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to me he got deal TV background and the passion to know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it all together so when I you know found you know I was like oh my\nGosh he's like he's like this is great so now how have you been able to go all across like the planet I mean you've been everywhere this this is this is good\n[noise] well there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there's a lot of money in\nThe rain and grow by some sort of X. files department but I'm not exactly\nYou know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and do things like that but I'm but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at ghosts again all\nRight you know they're like we're gonna we're going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there was a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and\nSo that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean\nAnd you talk to every one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the ... of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass the credit coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do I Do it at midnight\nRight on that willfully night that's right will swing [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that\nSay Halloween you know saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know\nI always see it as fun I see it as a\nI I mean if you say Halloween I immediately saying a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think a fall whether I think of orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is an led goblins\nAnd and it varies bond funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of it and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is a banner rapper\nWith us he is an

know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAnd he went to the the um [noise] the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to use that exactly\nI was just such an offensive I was like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I Want to offer but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go x-ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really thick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often\nX. rated the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know in for something like you know\nIt's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious\nYou don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this law something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restrict or the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the with Charles ... have you know they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nSo your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a kid's costume ... and what you find\nIs that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back\nOver a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your past the molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turned Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the sexy police officer or to\nDrag yeah and of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff\nAnd so you know ... that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it and\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we now basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future um Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a an estimate your question yeah I think that um you know ... ... mentioned I mean it's it's\nIt's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we went to each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nAnd I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like ours and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum now who knows like address how we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids left an eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual go\nYou know where you got like holographic oh you've got to that because that he was this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to are asking

well ac [noise]\n\n\nWillis here on coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween and uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all\nSo it's a great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGoes tiny so Ben I'm as we talked about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creeping from you know mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's you for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean I I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... from the conservative cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a say in all of us when it came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is coming to Eighteen\nYou know ... not suffer which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to see genes hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a where'd you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using a ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the\nOwners were so so concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the room you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the\nConcern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat's when because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... motion that a kid the dresses up as a which are of goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party\nSo the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is not always as a harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrow mine either right away I assumed\nOn those [laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen oh they were great under you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face with last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there\nNow are so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nI'm On line or on your smartphone with our radio gets a free app now at W.

[noise]\nIt just goes to goes to you on TALK radio Fifteen ten W ... [noise]\n\n\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here will is wean is what's going on right now we're\nTalking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghost\nThen that means that by definition their their material because we you know sound is audio waves and and you know ... you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so [noise] so\nYou know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are one of the the replicate what we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghost because people do report seeing them people record you know they're recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... film detectors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking goes PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut but no one has ever prove that you know the location with high enough um correlates with with ah with ghost siting there was a guy named Michael person you're a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it uh\nAnd that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots\nOf pseudo science and sort of want to be science or in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think coaster awesome if they're real and I want to I Want to be able to\nFind them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we could talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it well\nYou know um I I don't know it go for I mean that that you know a quarter million dollar question right I mean you know even even among the the ghost hunter unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you just don't have a theory that there is something that's going on and\nIt was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone in treating the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beans other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions you know problematic for ghost research right because\nGoats can't be both in our dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that\nThat my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spiritual but that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for giving me the information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up so we're going to be talking they wear Wilson London so you'll want to stick around Benjamin 'cause all Sinclair he's somebody you want to meet out in the case in time\nDefinitely thank you yeah yeah well tell us where we can find you and I get

we're talking about basically the werewolf of London the flinched in werewolf in particular and ah if you go to our website there's some really great sketches\nFrom some of the a witness\nTestimonies of what was seen and we were just talking previously\nAnd now the uh where will that we've seen holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured these sketches DePaul by the way he's an artist as well just when you see when you see coming to life\nWell someone you know drawn it's it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses\nNow POM Wonderful artist sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former harbinger so now what you do you like to ... year retired in you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nThat's correct on a yeah it seems to be\nCattle grazing its last run with it being the old so to lake but I don't have much in the sediments and everything I've produced so it's a fertile ground very fertile ground well yeah yeah I don't think that that's why the cows and not race offices in it you know the\nFirst thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it sightseeing or you know and he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and ... and places that he shouldn't civilian on private land\nAnd um it was a place called ... in green day which is\nEight miles from flicks than and he still lives in Britain Dale and it's an interesting story he said did you ... it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that\nSomething was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what might it might snow to catch the ... and the has the other game small game\nAn ... ... is ... so to ... born and bred and he's with Iraqi them out to miss snow as\nYou said but we couldn't ... he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing a sudden there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see so two rows of its own as you look over towards the uh the the open fields\nAnd he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching in the daytime from the lodge hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall\nAnd they will you still to turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and his peripheral vision and looked and saw it on the left over the head ...\nHe said he thought he was a U hauls it meant halls so HBO the blessing 'cause I thought what are you also first so I couldn't believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is that this thing was as big as a small pony or ... you know your horse\nHe said and the interesting thing was he ... over the edge and just let him that he said well you'd expect to host a London move forward because the the momentum this thing just one that I'm Still like a magnet\nSudden something not to look at that he said it was\nThe most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he glad them before you run away he said what he was on all fours and he said if you still do consider being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder he said you know he said he went out of tiny waist and the main like a lion and the face of a of a boom\nAnd nothing is a ... woods and he said he's able to almost sort of Britain tilling cola you know like a box that dog all the stuff with your votes areas\nAnd\nNot what he ... he says well he said I went to him to the edge both of them to try and get fence stave it says to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible um you know\nThat's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast Kony and if you if you go further down the coast to watch a whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bumps than drain that were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd this was such a supposed to be aware of that was such a going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and they could go further up the coast you've got\nOld folklore ... legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven scouts what they term they tend to ...\nAnd you know these stories have to have that they've come down the behind the down in time ... there's just I think those grains of truth in the stories so that was a side thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies and he lived in Britain do all his life and he's never seen it since he's never seen it\nBefore that and they'd never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to that savvy you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it coming you know made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before we had\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote you are in I Would have heard target and then she target she mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know you're looking at the national territory that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these poodles\nAnd they were in time war and they would just go through one time or another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know we're we're a human with the um\nUm I find I find it also interesting when you were saying that Ari yeah is there the world's oldest operation arena our base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a funny\nThat might be my phone about coats out people just because he's got no no\nNo well is showing no actually it's all now I'm a I'm Sorry about this listener's ... to do you want me to hang up and you\nCatch me back because of the you know well\nWell you're flying right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange it is operation arena may the oldest one is in the midst of all these happening now you're talking about\nThat is correct Tony ... and ... ... briefly jumping to them to the animal mutilation is taking place there's a radar based there which is eleven miles from stocks than world as the crow flies and that one's close not one closed about Seventy two ah if actually said sixty eight but he was still operational or the sparsely until seven to two\nAnd that's on the edge of the north sea audio them some of the ... the ...\nOkay now he's gone [laughter]\nBall a little\nUm\nNo I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance with Geico\n... percent or more car insurance\nAnd follow us on Twitter just go to W. L. A. C. dot com and click that little pea [noise]\n\n\nWe're back and we're taking um a Paul Sinclair and we are pulling everything out of him that we can about the we're ... around him it's cheap flicks in werewolf stories from ... year hundreds and hundreds of years ago\nThe werewolf inflict spin\nAnd other crazy crazy things that are going on in the area that he lives around\nAnd he's learning them in the east studying them and he writes about them and tonight we get to hear about them ourselves so first time ever on coast to coast and already on his second phone so we've cleared up the phone deal\nSo Paul I'm welcome back with your new phone hopefully this one will last a little bit longer and strange things happened when we talk about strange subject I'm\nVery much [laughter] yeah yeah that was kind of funky for sure\nWell Johnny honestly they were brand new about it but I'm On a ... phone now so ... which would be fine\nUm you know\nWe we were jumping into the store is now trying to give listeners a breakdown of why they why the area's special and how the stories of come through and a little bit of history about the area and everything's quite close to the coast as well Tony you know in most instances but only like four miles away from the coast to the point\nAnd these and the this coastline around ... to ... to the un speech and the rookie clips with absolute must have network of sea caves some of them have never been never beat entered I mean if if we romance with the notion that this was a real living flesh and blood creature breathing\nBreathing and surviving then I suppose it could function in in these areas\nSimply because of ... in a ... anybody would get a bit of research would find the ... and there's more ships being wrecked out to say than anywhere else in the u._k. you can't get close to these cliffs\nA you know I'm not saying that that's where these things and have a story is just an angle to look up\nVotes I'm staying it quite close to flex than Kony and twelve miles away there's a huge area of would love to know if you're in North your trickled ... Dale [noise]\nAnd we can sort of accurately they listen to the summer of two thousand and six and three young men or mountain bikes sort of set in the trailers and doing what a well all you guys are ... women girls as well we're doing a good such a ride around the woodland pots\nAnd this one may fall into the big for type ... is nevertheless an interesting story\nOr late evening still light\nAnd the the ... the ... about fall for high end result trees all around them as the recycling down these parts\nOf the ...\nMountain became aware and shouted tuition says can you see that he says about forty four to away from them that on the path in Nebraska and moving that going down quite fast down these hills\nIs what they described as an upright gorilla now they described it says up right because they didn't appear to be ruining\nAnd they they that black fur covered very big uh\nYou know I think we're talking like over eight feet tall\nA well like the ... before it's all in the city for four to ... votes at least\nAnd these things they described it says like it was on a track your ... you know they couldn't see legs and they said they were living up around ... Dale they were familiar with most of the\nThe ... the phone or an ... an ally of the ... there's no way that it wouldn't have been jumping over fall and branches in rocks for this thing ... was just smooth and gliding over the top of the Bracken as though it was just fixed ... he says when we were going as fast as we could\nCause I said did he frightened your says hell yeah they said we were absolutely terrified\nSaid because we're keeping pace with us and it was ... that was the strange thing as well ... well it didn't seem to have to look forward\nIt was look it was fixed on them so\nIs it eventually we go to the ... which fall off to the left and to the right they said we went right sort of choosing the path that will take them far away from this thing and they left they saw the scene of it [noise]\nIt yes these two friends if they wanted to talk about it I got the story of one of the guys they they still tobacco the story but they they didn't want to they didn't want to come forward\nOr with the amount of detail that this this month so if they're given my book I think probably looking up more something big foot relate to that but once again there's a mystical element to it in the he's\nNot running in the way the conventional way we would expect some things to ruin all moving should I say you know\nIt's an ... you know it's it's\nWe just got a bill for a little bit you know we we talk a little bit before we did this and say Hi to each other and one of the things\nThat that is tough for both of them is there's no word that really work in our language for what this is so hard to describe the scene and are these events as well as the beans in the creatures themselves like you just can't put into words\nWhatever's going on there whatever it is it's beyond what we know and what we're supposed to know or see or what is supposed to be real and it's so hard to describe these things when you put together I mean yeah we want to focus on the where we'll split\nBut when you put all his together in the area that you are there's so many things that are going on\nIn radius and again going back to the fact that these radar bases were there and there was a picture that you had\nDid you mean I guess it's been one of your book that was a picture I'm a I guess there were some happening then that went on some sort of the den and were seen and then the next game or maybe within the same hours now that there's like vehicle\nAnd it's got some sort of satellite dish on it\nAnd it's going up to this guy I mean actually been legal they're\nNot the kind of you you're talking about something that we saw in on July the twenty fifth or twenty seven thing to just if we if we major jump from the Web was for the moment is yeah sure\nThese vehicles I've got a phone call from a guy called David hind [noise]\nAh lives in the village of ... and he said Paula thank you really need to go and look at these vehicles out and I did just that I took a camera I got pictures of them and they were the drums and they had a huge green books on the back with a radar dish on the top [noise] um I'm trying to do this ... county 'cause I'm realizing you might want\nMe to talk with the weather channel\nAnd put a band that was a huge trailer which we now know how to ... or a generator which would top to now the license plates or German\nOr an ... on the the units themselves was American that in an area the little known this script village called ... and the\nPatch I'm Blake Hounshell lane Blake how Blake can bring bread linked to them slumber to them and our

told me about\nOn black Halloween [noise]\nOn the twenty fifth of July when these vehicles will see and and the state weeks by the way they weren't just that on the twenty fifth of July the same night we go photographs of life some of the sea\nOr I don't say they like to lay out in the ... we we have the images that you know because lots of people can say these things and complicates oh\nJust three points of life under the sea and daylight and whilst upon the cliff talks I received a phone call from a guy who asked you know he's not Paul Sinclair or no you're interested in the UFO subject my daughter's just seeing a UFO the ... the night previously\nDescribed the UFO and this was about six miles away a lot of miles away to a place called gas and on the walls and interestingly he just doesn't have to comment he said the something else as well I said oh what's not\nHe said well it's a huge amount of ... just a tough road with a big dish on the top pulling a trailer another one we later found that there were six of these units around the area when this high strangeness was a ... you\nKnow this is the same time crony the all the shape will be mutilated the road there will be
