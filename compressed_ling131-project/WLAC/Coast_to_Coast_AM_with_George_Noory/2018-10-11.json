called\nOr things like Parkinson's disease or the ... and of course in parking Aziz MS Lou Gehrig's disease hunting is these are all kinds of the same diseases different parts of the brain are randomly or more severely deficient and things and you get different symptoms based on the different part of the brain is more severely affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors were those diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or essential tremors an matter billionaires come from all over the world for me to treat them for those need to get rid of all the bad stuff no fried foods and processed meats no oil so gluten snow sugar and then you take one healthy brain and heart attack or a hundred pounds of body weight one healthy brain and heart back for a hundred

you to listen to that CD many many times and you're just shake your head and say well there was my problem you've been listening to doctors and staying away from cholesterol ... as your best friend\nWhen reading that butter you want to be eating dairy products that has a have a high fat dairy is a big study with a hundred and twenty thousand people with like a central tremors and Parkinson's disease\nThey found that they had a deficiency of dairy fat they were eating zero fat yogurt the reading skills drinking skim milk or non dairy coffee creamer is indeed the whole creme de

the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment underway does the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't\nTell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could see it as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down and it the the ship a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works and it\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just courted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about Dick piece intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence and the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yeah ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went out went up in fairground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so what's going on\nHere and what do you think this is what a people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can share what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make each grow faster to purify water\nTo healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you\nKnow of the thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has a good record is that in terms of studies so\nAs a hey what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seem to be created that has great power to change things\nNow maybe he'll think the experiments you\nWorking on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and\nWe chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together and what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid cold Luke who was Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot structure after his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he broke and everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica it's who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert\nUm I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be in and out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments\nIf you just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the tone of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted\nTo know what happens if we put people in groups of\nI had a life university is the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power of eight to let their nervous science department look at this\nSo we sent up eight groups of students\nAnd we put a ... G kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the groups and what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the parts of the ... group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us have worried doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one this\nAnd when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctors said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like uh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks any static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sci fi master sure my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nWas to do when we're going to court break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of each and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable Lynn Mick Jagger ... linked up for you that coast to coast day I'm ... dot com sober other books the bond\nThe intention experiment and\nSign up no go zone or breathe email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com\nGoes on TALK radio I mean\nYou can do is serving part time in the Air National guard in the air guard your an extra cash and money for college while gaining high tech skills and one of nearly two hundred career specialty\nAll the Tennessee Air National guard and won a hundred G.

she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn I'm\nSomebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had

often that\nIt it has convinced me it's not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and we as they say we compared it to things like meditation\nAnd we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university um has their nearest scientists and\nWe're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with ... with the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else ... when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas you're it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your next through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that\nWe um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas you're often makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like a ... so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be in your hand you have there that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence but\nWe've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nUs talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intentioned experiments\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that [noise]\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful [noise]\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people need\nChanges their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone calls in just a second on

manifest things definitely um I've certainly seen that in my own life and seen it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know\nI I wrote about this is my last book the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never and we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater whole we've never supposed to be alone and I think there's something about that group support that group feeling\nThat you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness or something that's really powerful and you know in many cases we've my master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers\nAnd they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is a batch of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person\nAnd that's the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a group of strangers you know praying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found Lynn in your studies that these abilities\nWill work for people\nOf certain age brackets assured sections or just a few anything\n[noise] [noise] no I mean you can be young you can be older you know I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff or people who are you anywhere from their thirties to their seventies\nUm it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques that I teach you know in becoming a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things do intend for and how to do it but\nAlso being part of that group and just meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a clinical psychologist\nBut suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that and what they intended for was that he would find the source of his in his depression and soon after that\nHe got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted\nBut the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight loss weight and he got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man\nHe um he is chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung ... better he\nGot a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique\nAnd everything in his life was getting better and even his training you know his his um\nHis his trainer at the gym and said to him what are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when Mitchell would say you know\nI had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert let's say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better and so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year\nWhen when you do these intention non experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what do they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intent or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it\nOr ... or whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that\nWere intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having you know we we have our meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about my book the field\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so we we have this one little power thoughts saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it and so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity\nBut probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about is being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a ... don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe fulfilling the gap\nAnd that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes fit land the gap and a really negative way you know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was a Paul McCartney he's a second wife\nUm she was he had lost his love of his life Linda his first wife\nAnd he was mourning her and he met Heather who had been a she was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model\nAnd she was a glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and she lost her leg below the knee one of her legs\nBut she was very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who had lost limbs\nAnd that's when Paul McCartney met her now Heather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly after pull married her and it fell in love and marriage her you know she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle but\nI think you know what ended up happening is as the marriage got sour um she they the British press started digging up all this stuff about her\nOwn or computer and listen to I heard radio pick up the pre I hard radio ... store or go to our radio dot
