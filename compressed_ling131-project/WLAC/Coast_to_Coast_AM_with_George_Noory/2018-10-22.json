for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stop working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about um something that looked like big but when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and\nHadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago when your first year can you recap the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the heroes\nAnd they found each other later in business\nAnd you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar and counter and they said you know if we you have Twenty years of police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to Hooper which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police ... background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of 'em were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd then other people came

W ELL lazy [noise]\n\n\n\nWell come back we're talking with David polite us about big wild man and giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people ... whatever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how he and some colleagues had collected a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um eh observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\n[noise] well that's the part that I I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera and one of the things that nobody did that\nMost researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nThat you could think that you're around and maybe a coyote or bird is right near you when in reality it's going to be them and they have this incredible ability to mimic anything that they want\nWith incredible strength in size and when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community in the big foot world that is very adamant that they're an ape throws this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try\nAnd this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out and when I when I found it\nI couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\n\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\nYears later nine years while I can\nI can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\n\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started in Nineteen fifty eight so before then people in other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you have elected they call them wild\nMan of course I guess that would fit I mean they they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry um they don't know what else to call them\nSo walks like a man walks up right it doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an ape um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive a ... I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different\nAnd the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods and even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about is never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have Howard while or giant human bone\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions and the articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you I Know and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise]\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero shows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAt and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nBut said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was like yeah\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went in to the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some exporters wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his horse and look them either I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things haven't happened ridiculous\nOr the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from shock valet you wrote about it and they have a clip from\nSeptember Seventy sixteen eighty it was a report it in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big what people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of it and uh his book which was a Kickstarter project\nRight um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big for topic it\nWas a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project

L. A. C. dot com\n[noise] [noise]\n... you know looking back at your ... your original book Hooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nOf these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people I'm just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's a general consensus or a certain matches what other tribes dated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to find a group or an animal I never find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nLook back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up and this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean um\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo one I did with ah the give them an film it and wanting Harvey has the ability yet is let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on\nHas a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face she can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Bigfoot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your account the news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences I sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows what with what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we buried so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed a playing with fire\nSo think about uh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods obscene these things do an unusual things other times or they're seeing them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be a young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big put that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up but as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em cramped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big what the kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you\nKnow there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it than fat\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot at look to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him are apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big for the world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on a ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nIn um take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hurting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and\nThey don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend a giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast they\n\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nIt's the talk radio Fifteen ten\nWN lazy\nWednesday low sixties\nOr by the accurate mortgage Bruce ... just tend to\nView on the on the ...\nAnd ... ... dot com\nNews on all Stevens many members of Congress not buying an official explanation on how Saudi journalist or ... show was killed in Turkey earlier this month the spotlight now on the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman I Believe it's five of his top personal buddy\nGrieving\n[noise]\n\n\nTo talk to Georgia now called the wild card mind when he finds zero one one zero in on\nThe first time caller line is the one eight vibe zero one for civil to one to talk to read from east of the Rockies\nGoal eight hundred eight to five bombs zero three three from west to the Rockies toll free goal eight hundred six one eight eight to ... this is ... ... am with George now\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney as they were known to do both had fragments of the individual songs put 'em together came up with I've got a feeling that was on let it be sounded pretty good that's the Beatles with of course Billy\n... we're talking with David blight is about big but wild men and giants archived articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty to his new book and as I told ... some of these uh descriptions of the writing is just terrific on the part of reporters from long ago this is from the state ledger in Mississippi July Fourth\nEighteen eighty for the title while wizard of the woods in which\nThe reporter describes an encounter on one occasion eat the creature was seen about wearing a large fish with demonic hold greed in a short space of time between his massive jaws and enormous cheap the bones being crushed\nAs if they were straws this guy came to work that day and a and did his job we're going to go to the phones in a moment looks like they're pretty full day polite is still working his magic with the coast to coast audience we'll be right back\n[noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could have a trio the relation one of the leading causes of syrup mind out before the late\n... cardio mobile the FDA clear to personal EKG device and just Ninety nine dollars to order with a cardio dot com K.

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film or anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute\nThat I think about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone\nWhich has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the person film is real\nWhy haven't we caught despite that on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back to skin Walker day but it the the comparison is a pretty clear is that that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera that would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes that you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can poke itself the change of shapes and it can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes us I'm tired different topic difficult to research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess\nYeah\nTrying to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big what country Hey Tom how're you doing\n\nIs Tom on the ... are lined yellow\nI think Tom has gone uh okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two does that suggest that another a book of archived articles about\nSightings could come some other time\n[noise] [noise] well not really know and and just so everyone knows that this is a book that contains the actual article these aren't rewrite for the articles this is the real deal Nineteen twenty two was cut off point for copyrights\nOn those articles oh she'll buy more than you could print them after them you can't because they're still protected\nUm well it's a terrific piece of work uh I Love reading it I I Want to go back and read it again because there's so many details that escaped me as I was preparing for the program but I I said some of the writing and this is just terrific and it's always great to have you on the program and I don't know when you sleep but I Hope you're taking care of yourself\nI'm always I'm always eager to be on your show Georgia and and the response I get from being on your show is out of this world good so I appreciate the effort you put into it\nWell thanks very much I appreciate it and maybe we'll have you and get Melba catch him back on here some time and talk about that DNA stuff that'd be great\nAlright ... again the big wild man the giants is the new book check it out if you get a chance in a moment we shift gears to talk about the true story of the worst the disaster in us naval history\nAnd the fifty year fight to exonerate an innocent man Indianapolis coming up momentarily here I\nNever\nLose the ... sign up for the ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nIn the air guard you'll or an extra cash and money for college slugging high tech skills in one of nearly two hundred career specialties all the Tennessee Air National guard and won a hundred T.

in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nOr\nA Sarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and suck\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I I Will someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could ... thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me that the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was very ... project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying have\nOpportunity to work on an iconic ... story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive to get this email from this young filmmaker going there and let it\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm going into an apple storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote\nA part of that too and major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we found rather that we only the Senate hearings on\nSo you're kind of stuff and it's the same writer I don't know how to raise a family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd I'm no number one that I made a veteran now that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story like this one um\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her right [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her fat or eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and a twenty four\nUm and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprint commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab me ... my father was a at ... he drove a landing craft from the ship's took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the capitalized version of what the world knows about the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to ah give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned what was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shifts and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of of now where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was the case of sitting in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on this whole journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nTo circle back and\nThe men who marry the atomic bomb aboard an athlete was an army Robert a major name Robert burning and he had spent the last couple of years after the war running down all the material that they feared that your image where you try to develop their own atomic um uh\nOn the continent if you're one and then\nBurn and very little boy in island\nUm status final breathing yet or Europe and conflict and so in writing the book we tried to hold back Atlanta can bring in a lot of other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese pointed addition to hash amount overhead and for here in the county has got\nManner and what we tried to do storage where you have to recognize it even men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what\nI tell you what ... I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break we'll come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes to a um [noise]\nListen while you were W.

D board somebody\n\nGoes to goes to you on TALK radio Fifteen ten W well easy [noise]\n\n\nSaloon been since I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYes a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting\nOut of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use\nThe ... um\nWell it was it and then more sort that he's published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and a Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America and English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from commend her how she noticed point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was a commander\nWho cared for his men he was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against\nProtocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarine because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother says commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts\nUm the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they couldn't walk on their backs you know from shark the shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's want to kill you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they go oh there's mood I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen rats between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day\nOkay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how\nThursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason that some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding out the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth\nAnd thinking that that would drain the salt out well of course that didn't and then other when you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin hoping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with that is a condition called hyper ... and\nSplit that food for\nBlood cell ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible death from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around either that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nCouldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it did sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off you have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who have been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from Milo and there is no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action though he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of storage for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yet the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it\nSo you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know the gentleman richer the friends that have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there\nHe actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one I saw this and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when we're ... released about it that he would\nWe are talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but uh there were survivors into what came next is a equally amazing we'll be right back\nFind out more about tonight's just log on to coast to coast am dot com fads revolve\n\n\nIn floors before these extra cost shredded would you\nWell at a by force direct warehouse that's exactly how it's done you\nKnow you won't see the fancy displays but you will see the absolute lowest prices on every kind of flooring out there we buy from top manufacturers all over the world in massive quantities and ... street from our warehouse director you that's why Nashville's top contractors used by floors direct\n... tons of money and you can to to skip the retail stores and come to a by force direct warehouse or go to buy floors direct on Tom and never pay retail for Florida\nHurricanes in earthquake Simon Carrick Fox News extremely dangerous is how forecasters are describing hurricane Wilma in the Eastern Pacific now almost a category ... storm on track to hit Mexico's west coast between Mazen lawn and Puerto Vallarta\nOne eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nYou love us now like us next time at W.
