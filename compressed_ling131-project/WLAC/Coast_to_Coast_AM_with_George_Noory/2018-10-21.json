Martin\nYeah that was very very chilling and very fascinating I think\nHe was right on on about a lot of stuff on when you ask them about the anti Christ and all that I was really my radio started fate and really bad in and out when they started to answer that question started banging on my radio on everything really yeah said oh no I Want to hear this park 'cause that was a really good question and ah\nAnyway I wanted to ask you ... ... you know anything about that ah the Turkish government\nI'm pleased to talk about it oh\nWell I'm a I I Wonder if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you were going to have their previous on friday afternoon to the whole program it never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would have been obvious so I mean there's a Catholic priest\nOr what I Wonder yeah but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I would like to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want to excuse me what why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ing and and coming back because they said that the way we learn yes if you remember they always say that they say that's how we learn yes and yet\nOn the program friday night you and the priest both agreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that\nOne on remembered clearly\nYeah well if if we keep reincarnate aid to come back at to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in ... which is that we're getting dumber and dumber and dumber ... and now there's another problem with the reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words yeah more\nSouls yeah right\nSo maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being in effect outmoded by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI don't know why I like now when\nYou first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a master's is a guest and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor no I haven't changed my mind at all I have to run several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I seldom Misha program but I I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh no a boil then you must not catch 'em all well I can say because I've had Roy and I would say over the years\nProbably at least a half dozen times I think you've been on this station [noise] well I don't know what station you're listening to the one you're on now ah I'm On three hundred stations man well I Know I mean oh I'm In Las Vegas\nOkay that helps you mean it'd be easy or maybe not since we've been on cable you gee that's right\nWell that's what I mean you know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah ... ... would you consider having him of course I think he's very very interesting and ah or him or any any\nA guest and who would give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not\nSurprise you if you are found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I\nI think I heard him out a lot I've that I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that never would want\nBecause people could keep messing up their lives and each time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better than the next time and they never do and then with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see I don't rent 'em well maybe I'll have them on how 'bout that\nOh I I I'm going to make sure I never miss your pope them because I won't know ahead of time\nYou announce it well I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you very much

audience who listens to my show I really didn't even have to say anything I knew all of your catching it\nOh golly I mean it was it was right down to the tea but he said one thing that jumped out at me when we started talking about the anti Christ is yet to come or my all ready for a year right he'll be the one that will present the problem is to us and then my show show the solution that's right

core wisdom in simple clear English the first time Thomas heard this wisdom was when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person on the radio and in September twenty twelve he spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry who d'nese\nUm how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nOf for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that I Know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all taking what they were doing and so um that kind of got him going\nAnd so we as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of\nOur way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that young student who had been on the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and they would have\nThem come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake mediums he would send his assistance out and\nThey would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and here he would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into my\nThat's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else run it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would just I just wanted to ask you briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spirit you listen yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm a ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best [noise]\nWell I'll pitch and on and just a minute but I just wanted to point out I think that this worked\nBecause back and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and\nHarry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his mind putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to ...\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul spirit was surviving gap and so his got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur\nFord was well aware of who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't taught us I got to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\n\n\nNo\nNo I didn't go\n\nAlong with ... feet up\nOn your smartphone where ya on radio [noise]\nOnly out there I see it now you experience it that's why I collect watches old watches because of the craftsmanship if you want really thought full attention to the to\nThink of it as well general election is Amr ...\nQualities practical for now you guys are so we knew your sample ballot and bring it with news is a guy you must be registered to vote on all day\nOn my phone and you're home printing your sample ballot provide that information from Montgomery County board of less than what they call\n\n\nThe mirror networks Brazil's goes to goes to the you\nKnow use your guest does Richard ...\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.

P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay um the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the sounds as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a

continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count\nBut the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and\nSo all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into

then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends in in braced standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now

kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs in the ... the the forced a started nations in the Ukraine and so forth\nUm but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nOr paint me I'm a ... a portrait of the young FDR\n... you know off the island was a I

through school or you'd rather the roof off and go play football and so forth\nAnd uh it was a ... and here's what was that I wanted it was but he was a new something was really a ... is really something\nAnything anyone was there for the asking and his political where it started out in the last of our main and getting out from the physicians and they blossom than being I Wonder if you are\nA lot of people don't know what the I was governor of New York edited forgot but they're just not talking about it any more or less you know he was the road we'll man now he just talked to him [laughter]\nOver Roosevelt was born and Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt fighter Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman got ready to change the monitor ... part of life actually\n[laughter] no um\nNo I mean this is the evolution of a person\nShould at least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nThinking it was a second ago right\nAnd and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what because that was just not the way that he was raised with a that Roosevelt name off that would have done anything differently but what if he was\nA quote in early a bull all you have a special night comes out so he did a lot of\nThings without unsavory slip and some self marrying his thoughts on on finding a number of rows of you know that name that was it was awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the lows well name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York classic now he was he was also governor of New York we just lose as always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have ... I'm\n... I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy sock scene Kmart back in the er member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV reporter he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nShort [laughter] ... loss of freedom he gets a free pass off the\nWell the thing is to guys will have to talk about when you get back on it it's it's a history repeating repeating itself\nWith the Russians and the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible are popping in your town and won't won't catch it you know they felt the hell\nBut how is it that's a that no one sort of you know notice\nStore or said hey wait a minute or president does Ina is in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then obviously we know better now but the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago um that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and that whole people for five years I got off the opposite saying that\nThis was a guy who if he would get really think on four or five thought processes that one that's really really really tough so what do you do is he'd be like without someone on one arm he will lift ... and that help but look ... or something at the time he would appear to be walking\nPicket couple of steps so we can get I guess you know buying podium use a little bit different than the shops and\nYou know they they did it remarkably well so they they are to ward off the fact that\nUh in case anything do you eat painting insurance shopping to go public and claimed that you know five minutes straight so low showing any for X amount of hours so I mean look propaganda and all those oil swirling motion even back then you know it's just that\nThey knew was smaller and easier to control obviously we didn't have other things that you know cell phones and cameras on the phone so you know they get twice a day at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely um ...\nLike this it was complicated fire I'm struck the point the lemon had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January\nYou didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or at a waiter take office for or ex so this\nMystery thing on the hundred days and they still judge presidents ... hundred days [noise] um actually I had one hundred years because of pitching\nRight he had him for a year and a four months

Mussolini at first he was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency over the last um\n[noise] so America gets under the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it to the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way [noise] um\nAnyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do with stolen at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was\nThere how close England cans are losing their island they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and lay down air strikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war and now we're there\nTo help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course that who had met previously and I'm sure she'll really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who got the\nTwo together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time\nThat Stalin in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um church elected for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trust that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great first I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspapers as far as I'm concerned and you know\nUm they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of\nThe United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... million\nFDR it seemed to ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it's balanced island in the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling hit a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such\nA delusional dictator if the if this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing\nA winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd they were just says well I don't care I Wanna do it so\nStyling is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table and wish to get this done\nRight so there was a the conference of Casablanca and\nAnd then later to Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still\nPretty robots or you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nMembers of the most of the revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of stone he was nothing more than a he was to keep the party journals are used to call him um read 'em on hundred index\nCard used to going to make fun of them because she was just so worthless when the party one by one he knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless might well maybe this guy was standing stop\nI'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that it is a quote from one of those will I'm rich

I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I wanted and debt I I think he did not want him that he wanted to live in poverty possibly that's just my my take on it\nCan clearly saying you know with Elvis Presley did not die of any sort of heart related in a um affliction\n[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young uh but just because he he surpassed\nThe average lifespan I don't think it was his lowest forty nine back then but I mean George Washington you know live to be in ... I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point and obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff and you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's there's the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi

that now nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and and me\nYou have a clue as to how they make their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told\n'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's where allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion\nAnd they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote fix the courage to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting\nStuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family are probably it's old money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very well the east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach her name to wants to be as best they can you know for them as far as like\nThe I I still get fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say that you know the ... and because it wasn't that long ago really this Seventy plus years ago you know one girl got a hold of me and\nHer her mother or her aunt was the cook from Warm Springs Georgia amazing it's just absolutely blew my mind I mean there's so we're not is not that long ago I mean the grander scope of

[noise]\n\n\nOil comeback Thomas ... is one of the freshest voices offering some of the clearest guidance on and light meant and spiritual awakening Thomas dig deeply into these subjects to reveal their core wisdom in simple clear English the first time Thomas heard this wisdom was when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and in September twenty twelve he spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nRichard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry who d'nese\nUm how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so we as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics or\nTalking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um that young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and you'd be ready for that\nBut this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive\nA medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer we take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini\nHim to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right I thought\nIt was I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... is there are so Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nAnd they had a friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nOut such an interest in it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of hurricane Harry's mother intrude into the session and\nIn his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to pass\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and sort of his got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of\nHoudini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nHe did Thomas I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in and got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me
