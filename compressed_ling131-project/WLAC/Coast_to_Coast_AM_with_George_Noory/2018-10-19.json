I Believe he started out doing magic tricks as many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] to to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid I mean I wasn't I was really good at that but you know I dabble with a lot of body experience when I was eleven\nUh which really I think steered me into the field that I mean now I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical\nAnd you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed you know if I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent and those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking it's so restrictive and limiting\nNow into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be\nIn growing in a consciousness or the kind of a digging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month in days\nTo have a birthday ... and a

many\nWill cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible\nHow could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't for more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other\nPlanets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation as to say yes a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious orders\nAnd just like it is there anything out there that bothers you the the the ...\nVery strange about\nWhen you say very strange about like um\nAre you picking on are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going the cemetery I don't like the energy there and people who are lose loved ones and they go to the cemetery frequently are pulling that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves\nAnd yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief\nBut you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about the right things and\nThink about that we can wish them well if they go into the light God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I was going to the cemetery is very bad ah you know my my parents were big cemetery ... hours as I was growing up is that a good word go earth [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like your roles\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation that went to the cemetery is a lot you know and uh I found myself a cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point my parents were pointing to a muscle am as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of those\nAnd I think they were wealthy at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here has no place [laughter] no I'm not going to stay here and that\nHas to do is I started crying and they said what's wrong with you I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nYou know I thought it was like a house on\nThe I thought they were going to those crazy people can live with my dog and my bike\nGeorge George with us we'll come back and we'll take phone calls questions rejoice

[laughter] absolutely George Norris reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call the power where'd you get it from\nI don't think it's powered I oh God that ... where it really is distracting yeah a lot of people say that and I think only God has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to have a ... and that's why she later we got the power from we all get our energy from it's a life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take our last breath\nSo the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals Joyce and many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom\nI'm fine [laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nAnd when I lost my dog he came to me and the little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side is that I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's a crazy they called me mom they really think that mother\nSo animals and that's your question tried to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI I don't want people to think the two sides that right is supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... burns said yes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have done ... ...\n... if the threat class sent you a sense than your feeling on that very intuitive so you can feel it presses or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh I'll bet ya impressive\nSo if you are with the press and who's not that good it would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche a\nVampire is higher but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know how\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary [noise] so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... or the ... day in year and then I just want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great however you're on a charge that the one that started with\nChristian Tampa Bay Florida Chris has ah been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen

to the realms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including three you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network\nA noted the author has got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGood to be dreaming weaving with your joys\nLooking forward to this and would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell festival my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we are living to west straight at to see her on the up riffing I Am the psychic medium of no mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned way and she saw my that she didn't tell us she went up ... came back white face well she was right that when ... when my father had been trends that in the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and help build the old my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that that is one of the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body age three members Rob a hot living under the afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions for the sisterhood appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the cuts the NBA to begin with up onto the field of looking at the ... of of a scalpel and the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to Luna Park a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanting to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go in the rye or could go into some addresses\nSo I'm going to learn a pack eight nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and when I received by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back adventure the opposite seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body of a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my life long understanding there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something\nWho could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really thick we've got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes with the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my goal dissociation\nBoth the buildup to eat the travel beyond the buddy drop when consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are except\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army so we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember of childhood was the big man and a lot of white hair and a big face\nBecoming sit on my that is the backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rub it younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe had time travel in our dreams and when we developed the out of conscious or active treat me as I call it one of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to choke to Hawaii\nIt's a self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example but it will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now\nIn one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling Olson means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solo consciousness survive physical tests isn't it pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the snow subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my employer include the love of family members around says to the spiritual guides of some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get up get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information on the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we\nCan reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you've learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to dust and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experiences papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with a God or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a death on a more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dreams sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nI've lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the\nGun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding often to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit of embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step prices to sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done in minutes you get some help with feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of the lead also the rushed to sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs don't deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it I mean there's good times and Bachmann loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nA bee on death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the mentality of adventure killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to time travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away is this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams show is\nOpportunity some challenges lie ahead they ... the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know the ... and show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates with death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheeler coming down the\nHill to fall on the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction\nAnd in fact you understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the NEA time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future apparel oh so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at other parallel and I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we're connected to dramas being lived in

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I cold she'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head ... says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat him to sudden goal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so ...\nYou know ... it's how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking ... waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life\nTo pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras in self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think there is a good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact\nSome scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense conscious so ... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kind of message to the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the body has its own messages discovery is that the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which ... maybe you do to what\nIt means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hit but gosh are my blood is bode again it's\nAll when you live in pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gone but the white queen screams\nBefore she ... fingers so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the before took place on the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms be says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it you know so medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel what the feeling in our body as well so that's a good story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loose the dreaming you'd call it shut many clues to dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... will do some dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state loose it what does that mean that means that we use shut many drumming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stop the stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream you another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming with the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look good as the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and felt the misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of helping healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that behind something that's scaring or worrying\nYou and your dream is a power power the understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and take

L. A. C. dot com [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast are dear friend Robert boss back with us as we talk about dreams will get your calls as well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's ... situations Joe in his dream life\nYeah he would do you own your own was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflection thought he has interesting thought looked every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship and son who is driven all his life by his dream one of the stories in my new book the scariest realities in both films at the end of the life and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of it that is in the previous documentation that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on Lake ... which was called ...\nAnd get up to the nearby village is living in another bowling gun on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost old fear of death you felt absolutely confident and so he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in a story in a mysterious around his Kobe other bought a gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlives situation and I actually gives some insight into where how you'll miss mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books are you in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut to Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself to a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped his view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this that gives the first time the ability to understand what happens to mind go consciousness off to death because in dreams as you understood\nWe receive visitations from the departed I didn't dreams we made travel into the rooms where they are at home just very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continuous lives and other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dreams maybe memories\nOf ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... is a ... to through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price of surviving that and coming back and adding his science and his scholarship to what he knew firsthand about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding\nOf all the things we're talking about some immigrated matter of you\nWho wasn't young soldiers who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had the disputes\nFreud regarded as his ... his ... year old was your most Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own and writes who made him so his number one case study which\nIs what you need to do to listen to anything on dreams from someone who's not a dream of despite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on and dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to plant to human streams\nAnd you had famously a dream in which he's in a house that has on many levels and the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is as a floor vote ... and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know among the complex and the desire to see somebody dead ...\nAnd Yom didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into a cup of narrow understanding\nAnd the breakup was very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversations with human Floyd approaching that pops up there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stop so how scared and confused and\nAnd and and you wrote in describing this he felt something ... and his belly like a hot sun is going to happen again and there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing up hot so what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the phone the phenomena synchronous city which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us\nSo it's a very interesting thing in my story about you'll you'll says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion he's evolved on a long way since he died but that doesn't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imagine all roam\nAround is a space between time and it turned the TV whether palaces and schools and universities and pleasure pox that are designed by human imagination in concert with intelligence is from a high a level\nI borrowed the word for word from from the writings of some medieval to feed mistakes who spent a lot of time traveling in these regions\nWhat what the magical realm is about is the idea that the imagination of the human imagination assisted by greater imagination perhaps\nMakes real worlds beyond the physical playing these reel to reel will of course\nIncludes desirable afterlife locations they also include places a study education and the negotiation and you know what you can find out about these things by going that as the story is to just let them offering as a puff of direct experience not just can be done theories\nAre less of a second hand to come I'm offering ways of knowing feels self whether you have available to you for example a place of healing and instruction initiation in a room beyond the physical so the stories about experiences and that kind of reality which is no less real I Would argue not physical well\nLet's take some calls here for a while let's go to a ... in Madison, Wisconsin welcome to the program ... go ahead\nGeorge I'm I was I'm thinking about talking about this topic uh several times with a several gas but I'm I'm I have a question\nAbout recurring dreams versus I'm very and hence streams um and whether they can either pattern or you just maybe ... remember them to occur several times\nSo a in a nutshell um since I was a little kid I was a um a\nSomething that would be near and dear to your uh uh thoughts George I'm\nI'm basically leading a bunch of people\nAcross the cornfield after basically I guess an E. M. P. mhm I was a kid so I wouldn't have known anything about this this wouldn't have made any sense there are no cars that were ... if we were what we were all looking up in the sky and seeing these\nSwarms uh uh I don't know like basically like a near earth orbit\nKind of battle for ...\nUm I don't know satellite battle or something like that and ... and we're all kind of downtrodden and I keep having the damn dream\nAnd like a cognitive dream you you saw the future\nOr maybe I Hope not [laughter] and you are not as well and then also and and I mean we're going to cross double a cornfield this more confident and um I and we're we have to make it north and I don't know what else from that I can give you\nAnd then also I'm I'm the one that\nKeeps popping up is basically my own death which [laughter] which hopefully not but I'm I'm doing some work at my father's place in the north woods and\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one bag light in the middle for on each corner and I realized that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away\nUm I Know that I'm gonna get hit with either a mess or something like ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think family damn\nIt's possible that you were dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest ... sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary on the tea yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible that the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a Luttrell meaning but at the symbolic meaning if I'm dreaming of of of the ...\nWhere we weren't going to come back Robert in ... and just take some final calls with you ...
