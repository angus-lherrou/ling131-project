hotspots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just saying you know that'd be coming out his window areas where it seems every fit in each brother comes through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pay for the ... post\nAnd somebody it's saying this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better way to use over the woods are at high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police although I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this by to wait activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like a dog man and a the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nI tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say real or ... or or possibility um\nYou know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nWhich I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\n[noise] well yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again and just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know was the fact\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pulled Nineteen sixty four and Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there\nOn the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Canfield [noise] um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me a ... the shining a yellow eyes\nBut the sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the hat everybody in the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not ...\nBecause he's got wings but he caught it looks like ... and I'm I'm from loyal in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a a lot of men in black stories women in black stories you and I've talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are held or operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black up trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign demanding black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say the vast majority of all the reports I get don't shamed anything like you know they step out of the Pentagon the CIA or the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies back typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skin is why\nWhy why I'm I'm people talk about I actually have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them before they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them by full and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper Bain using wager boats which puts another angle to it um but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but\nIt's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe based but many black mistreat each Bobby on you know just guys in black suits walk\nYou know I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a ... you know you've got a really weird won the next couple of events some which are age here perhaps to explain\nThere is a parallel with demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for the paper I think it's a very small catch a great ... they the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually unemployed the elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words it might be paid for with the government you know that many black role to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most have\nToo to threaten and quiet April who who've I may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black rail yard I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files where the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest\nOr whether or not you believe alien abductions

again on TALK radio Fifteen ten W well lazy [noise]\n\nWelcome back we're talking with the red burn 'em you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around and sort of the the the inspiration for this new book of yours top secret alien abduction miles\nYou're talking about uh the world in which we live we're mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately yeah and of course you know a subsequent generations of do grow into a world where I've never known any different you know I'm right\nThey live a certain age you know before the Internet age will remember that um that was not that sort of um worldwide surveillance that we have now and um you know I think that's one of the unfortunate things for future generations it's gonna be a child a normal thing for them and and\nProbably accepted as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they don't want to be for all the good reasons you know for health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways been in effect they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance device that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort healing abductions would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what Iliad Ilene abductions are all about that that idea would seem preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication guy he's the first to November but people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which again the classified through the fate moved from ... in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that wave yes it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with a guy to showing how falls evade put together now I start the book actually with the contract a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do ah put together falls unpaid who claimed to have had I mean ... for example just about all of the contact Hayes of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them how to FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm able to you by the FBI but yes they ... they are and say Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government government's very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick\nUm Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... was about ... and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape April now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the ... case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn fool around his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a failed rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these where dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft where they really strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly striking\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive and it revolved around him on my Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the moaning about to I Am an essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in Cairo to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vaguely interference phenomenon where they knew ... what's intriguing\nIs that they they uh British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report it to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce cause pulled a a promise to security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how they ... they promised them security services in severe Ronald wild man of ... to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct\nOh that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refer to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking\nSort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen when you realize that these guys telling these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people I condemn ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures of gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a call me and this type\nOf governments that communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ...\nBucks the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading his books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade when the bed we sleep

you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away\nGet away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas of lead to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about their death experiences and and the Syrian citizen and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional ... with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of\nAnd traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like dark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi ... thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would that hard time to normally charge it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out look and look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kind of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nI Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just\nSay worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to\nAnother to ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth of mentioned um sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flats where on that same piece of paper it has to directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube and your hand and that would be a three dimensional object\nHas three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In a\nWay back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nBut he'd scroll down to the bottom and click Georgia's calendar\n\nWould change\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nFollow\nUs on Twitter you can just go to W.

L. A. C. [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWe're back with Christopher white a Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who have struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific views came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he and his wife is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and many others in the book sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like out of it being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition [noise] cause mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turn to the fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual level or world reality I Am headed in an interesting story as you say he he grows up egos Oxford he\nFalls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he [noise] he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation is he he raises map addict and geometry as a kind of a he kind of hang on to that is the only sure thing that the way in which the map providing\nCertainty 'em to him but I think his his uh stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed as I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nScientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes I give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that can happen uh that didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job where they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six I'm\nNot a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a ... of that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on is as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experienced time has probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block right are we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually discussions discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it taste it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say are four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimensions\nThe dreaming felt he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments and done believed that I'm using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know hinting and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed this happened in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and we could talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that as\nYou know maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one of steak haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that\nAll of all of our dreams contained bits and pieces of future events and past events on the sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it a that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about to say on a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray

drill\nStream along with ... dot com or listen on your smartphone with the IRA radiolab\n[noise]\n\nA crisp white so tell me this in the example of flat land where this uh some higher dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional hum and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and I'm an avid spoke at flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as as kind of the higher dimensional objects that than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I tried to put you know a number of different people\nIn the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices in the book\nI'm Talking\nAbout what the meaning of these events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider and tuition or\nNear death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that we all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think\nI think that's what they're doing I think you know just like Jadav you've done right to have these dreams for him to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to\nHe went to sort of popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prior would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah\nYeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and at other times you know Americans you psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another round and\nIn other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely they're all different all different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project or consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about ... viewing and other a ...\n... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back a avid book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat on what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right fighting around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ... and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat where fighting around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle on he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line um every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat\nSquare gets pulled off of the two dimensional world\nHigher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full bench analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision and he never had right he can look down at ... he can the for the first time not just wind but he can see A People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you
