intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the lawn mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence\nAnd that's we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine you know in your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand two million and then it won't even know what you are um I find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good\nIt's it's ... it's very little suggest the machine will do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you get out of the airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems may be much much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\n... is it the human being\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that for a very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people got excited about a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the good\nIt it can it if you out of business it can make public any department in your business ten ten percent faster ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more inventions and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has\n... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nI just fantastic question um artificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode\nThat's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came up with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a peaks or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also step for gun powder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um there there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy is killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries\nThat are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I'll let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar\nAutomatic Gunter it that could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's going to have it well for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you\nThen argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ...\nA ... and ... and whatever country you are and and and third you know they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which\nUh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nAh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost\nA then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour we'll finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars do you see the day that you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with\nArtificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo find out what George ... speaking ... scroll down to the bottom including

don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so well correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes out of batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there aren't going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy

day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with\nPhysical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer\nAnd it may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers\nWill be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you've got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model doubt in the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages me already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did\nIs technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you kind of shut your clock by it all over the world a giant sort of sanctions and merge now some ... ...\nSo America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet because we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with the mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and\nI see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're ... you're right that\nIs already Fishell intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen\nThey're going to work or on a beach [noise]\n[noise] wow that's that's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things I'm to the first one you know you mentioned corporations that he's been go to it's very interesting to me the large companies don't usually make you sleep the of the original doll companies uh\nI used to say only ones left and then it was just ... gee it's none of the companies around the Dow originally the big powerhouses or they're\nYou know sometimes the new technology comes along and they just don't adopt a blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see that you mentioned them and I'm a poet the same story which uh which digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on right blockbuster on another one\nExactly what you do drugs I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and you know we went in search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is gonna be laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't up because uh that's a very real\nWorking on a boat you know I I kind of hope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for\nFor every single person on the planet like 'cause you can just ... careers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or\nAnything that requires a psychiatrist or anything that requires a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the information industry then yeah it was just there was a series of\nCommercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday you will you know should the box from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials kind of thing for the army did\nReally stay with us by run your just come back and take some calls in a final trap next on coast to coast am\nThe coast website is now streamline for mobile devices Greek news if your coast insider or simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android ...\n[noise] the coast to coast am on TALK radio Fifteen ...

if you think that the way technologies progressing that we may get to that and you're still at the age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause\nWorking alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time\nGDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people only worked Fifteen hours and so you have to ask like well what happened because GDP did go on a fault just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live\nThe way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes\nYou can work Fifteen hours a week and live like you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future people are going to say I'm going to stay late\nAt the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has\nA so we're not completely materialistic interestingly ... the time we save at home\nBut not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've\nIf if if our productivity goes off we just work more to get more and we always pocket the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm I I think\nThat question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we will have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know\nWho to machine a\nFix my road probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... faced a than than being a wife hand now

Know you're you're in the guests bart is entirely right\nUm we are using a ton of his weapons that may kill decisions of course we've done that since landmines we drop drop dumb bombs or I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decided that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Myron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit by Ron ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to how jumped\nTo very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide

go so vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming all kinds of people said it would be possible\nBut um you know this country the United states already goes way enough food to feed all hungry people oh no question that the world's strange to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be traumatic more to come out coast to

about some of his work and what a genius that guy is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is a good man to yeah it is it man\nI I have some great stories about him or he just allowed me and to um\nLike the the theater where they record all the music and he said you stand here this is where the director stands in Bay you know the best place to here they get every beat and I'm like oh I Love this guy\nYou got a great background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my hillbilly rates in Oakland\nHow are you talking about my day job your day job we haven't gotten to the Oklahoma hillbilly Billy ... [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous job\nAnd you how did you end up in Los Angeles on the truck work out for you\nUm you know I think it was a slow escape from Oklahoma\nAnd I made it to Texas first and then made my way to San Francisco and then maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who call their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers about this the fact that I mean here you are you are a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghosts will talk for\n[noise] you know this it's it's a great question I I think because what I Do day in day out is you know rooted and data and and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization that thing in a very\nDirect honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you make this up you know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be [laughter] and you know and\nI Would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent and you know they they just they can't make their way over\nRight are nine that's right and\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could they interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they are afraid to tell the story because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell they talk about their experiences because it's so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people say well believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening not yeah their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who has gone through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd they've identified roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because I you know when that\nStarted happening to me and I didn't know about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about ... feet a little bit of that medium ship just to get a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go\nSit we're almost a majority attorney were barely a minority\nAnd that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent now\nI I Would think so and the second that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google and to get this and every two seconds and I said again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is going to work\nThat are saying yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is listening\nUm but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes did you did\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me\nUm I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about it tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with ghosts\nYou have been doing shows me things were kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI used in what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise] um it\nWas an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron outta phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you didn't start investigating these strange thing\nYeah I um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how big me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um I I started you know after I saw the first coast and a photograph I um\nKnow I kinda panic was intrigued because I I got to be\nHonest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as in it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know much\nRight right I ... it was a navy this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really really take pictures of goes um so I you know\nI I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm\nWearing chaos and when you're in chaos\nUm you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd\nAnd I tell her story and she says oh my that sounds\nLike that was your spirit guy because I've never heard of such specificity she goes you know Julie we're born with spirit guide to kind of not just through life and if you're willing to be open and less than they are there to help us and I was a really good thing because I\nHad a heart that woman in the car in front of me and she had though no\nBaby\nIt wasn't a woman in front of you their life that your guide with saving it was yours [laughter] that's right\nI went oh\nOkay [noise] does that change you well\nIt in in a second it did\nSo I got to work have a weird day because I'm thinking\nYou know what a crazy morning that ... that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives in Cincinnati and Pam is known as sister it was ... was in the car when it happened so is pants husband this sustains permanent brand brain damage and as of today from that accident [noise]\nFor the call Pam tells the story and she says huh\nJust want to hear the other half of your story and I said sure she said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you called this morning I had the phone in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to go to reach for the phone that's paralyzed couldn't move\nShe said imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today [noise] she's like yeah he was dead and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nYou sure and the big lesson gift\nIs about paying attention people say what's your book about and I said I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you to pay attention and trust yourself\nWhen you take your picture ... mhm are you aiming at something or does it just tap\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I sat the phage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it wasn't hadn't all burned out yet [noise] and um I learned was

and\n\nOne man asked you know who are you and he said they called me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBashing the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked to you about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space\nAnd I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen again is just a theory which we're pretty sure\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark does it need more dark the dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight\nSo I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do to duplicate that experience yeah I can handle it now\nYou would really yeah I could but you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh ... let me just tell them so I just

when you say you've got to tell us\nOh yes so I yeah so I I so how how 'bout you just tell everybody incentive is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me in one night and said I saw the ... man again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what he said\nTell her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad\nWho was not very nice [noise] and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my step dad but I think it was the ... man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know if anybody tries\nTo if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that and\nHe brought that up and Alex didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you\n[laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\n\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge\nCompletely understand is I Am also I've
