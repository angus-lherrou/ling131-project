attitude\nThat's a ... you you are well you know you get what you ask for it right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where it was\nSet up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair and so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in\nFront of it I bought that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff\nYeah I think we can get the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level

ago and then you\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast am shooting them but before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology\nOn going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that place turned out to be here is if the one [noise]\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in\nThe state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military if your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these\nBeings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case you don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to\nBe safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here\nThese beings that ancient alien ah theorists talk about talk\nAbout this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slave us it might be a better fate for us to commit to global suicide in other words\nAgain I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know collars on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people who are banding together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to rise well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging\nMean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders\nBut there may be some some ah beings that we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see the possible examples like I'm perhaps present thing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\nUh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final wishing machine extravaganza I Am

I Want to tell you the story that happy they like in the nineties\nNow I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however ... Nineteen leaders middle nineties I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a memorial service when the church\nAnd I was in that close to him but I just said you know anyway I uh I went I was late getting have so I had to sit in the black church was packed and services going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the ... and I looked up and it was my uncle had just passed\nAway and and he told me he said\nJohn ... your car and I was shocked I didn't know what to do and then again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone but still I was you know I knew something and so I got it right on our friend of mine in the next morning I called my cousin which was the son named it that way\nAsk him if he wouldn't mind bringing my car to then I get him right back home he said not at all so he and his belt and got my car and took over the keys to pull that anyway he\nUm it was that in my car they pull that that ... talking to my ... my truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know I mean they had ... votes in mind that too but\nI never told me like this and I was really a lot to say anything that is what I did tell two of my close friends and I'm Out in the leg and not with the show they have\nThe\nI guess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know what I didn't want to ask you told me down and\nSaid you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that doesn't have any idea\nThey engage in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a ... that's the only time I had to think like a safe stage ghost yet all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientists who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are a spirit trapped here and this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on but\nOnce you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents and so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over my definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and\nSee somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point live like a king and and and this is very funny because\nHe still down ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and cathartic we releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here\nAnd you know Romney was fighting back yeah and it's because of that\nThat um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in part\n\nTwo seven nine six four or five want to

I couldn't seem directly straight you know just that core I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and so I start mop and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really\nShow theirselves\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there or was he\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone watching them and I was just wondering might\nHuh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\n... do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they ... from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nWhile he's off what do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold when when they call it an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and\nCertainly it means that again at least here in the United states this is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky ... or at very least metaphysical\nJosh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mysteries the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited it I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren

wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a of a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and ghost stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it and kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already are and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that\nArea of ah of ghost stories and a supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to\nCouple ghost stories with you know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these goals stories and events from World war one that overlapped in the world war two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise]\nYou know most of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there is there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past but sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in Norman during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn oh we're accustomed to less than was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was haunted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some a theory that also say that you the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole\nSkeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so high on it\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most talented a bowl\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists are documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers ... they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences\nIn Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and uh his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the our dense battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle the ball ...\nSo a pretty peculiar in and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least I hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah what you want to do a different time warp or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said\nThat as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... you make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these\nPlanes to be seen I bet they handles hundreds of we're going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you share your questions and stories where this\nGoes website is no

I didn't want to leave our our sailors\nOut no nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that ah those sailors served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and\nAnd some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the or the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona poses a and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah they're the a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seem to all\nSimilarity in that has to do with tragedy for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know the not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to\nWhen we hear these tragedies can maybe hope that that uh the spirits go honor the spiritual anger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and the let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of euro haunted rock and roll stories those ... those are fantastic too\nI Love
