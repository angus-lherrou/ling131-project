I like to say that I'm as you I Am a citizen\nOf history and history she clearly shows that a civil war shakes around fifty\nYears when it half as most people don't realize that they're already in the civil war\nTroop ... when they go back and look at the things that have happened in the recent past they they immediately think that you know we are in a civil war\nEspecially when they're young something like ... symmetrical warfare and ideological warfare people tend to think it has to be always an armed conflict that's why the guys who was the definition of war and I says well\nIt's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand are are armed at times and at times they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars sometimes there are warring factions with in certain groups where there'd be right or left\nHow many faction of groups have we heard the KKK the Nazis the communist or I could go down the list of black lives matter me too\nI mean just go down the list of all the factions are at war with each other right now none of them pulling guns on people but yet we have somebody who ideologically disagrees with Hillary Clinton the Obamas and the Democrats and they send a pipe bomb whether it be someone who's deliberately doing it to prove a point or at least create a false flag attack\nOr if it's someone on the ... on the right doing it to ... out of a left\nBut no one had even brought up the shootings of the congressman\nThere not bringing up the other of rice and that was ... and the rice who was around after President Trump this is certainly one sided and it's better just to basically harden the resolve of the persecution complex the left it's obviously that obviously this is what is happening\nOr a yes or am I still on yeah go ahead\nOkay I'd also like to say that um I Believe it was Mark Twain said a patriot as one who is scorned at first but when others join him it cost them nothing and I believe finally that that might

FBI another suspicious package this well founded a male sorting facility addressed with the California offices of congresswoman Maxine Waters\nBut I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing he's create an environment that somebody would be induced to do this you don't\nKnow that you don't know that we need to wait and get the official verdict from\nAuthorities intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about it a grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you\nKnow at one another stroke but we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorous\nThe debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media not not coast to coast\nBut the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem\nI Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability\nIn this we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned them into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keeps keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nThat our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false\nFlag it'd be somebody on the left that\nDid this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation\nTry to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stuff done but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a a ... it'd be one less thing but they flew it and they flew most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... and ... and when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric that drives us apart\nAnd and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ... we will talk this week\nAnd and see the rest of the story

easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost sufficiency let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I I like to make a technical comment on on the fence today um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as as being very very high\nUm for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat means all kind of trace evidence is available for them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the UN at some of them were sent through the regular mail us ...\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities they\nProbably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ...\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office cameras at\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story real quick\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individuals I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it\nAre the highest paid is going to raise the band with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the ah high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr am I from Lauren thank you so much will be

that\nOur our energy or aura right everything that we have anything lodged and everything we picked up from others it can also clear our own negative thoughts and you know everyone has negative

how does one heels themselves how one he'll do I want to know fail much English just recently or fail that is that something you can do to yourself absolutely merging has always always good\nTo explain smart you\nBurn okay this is just um like you just you get the bundled up stage and you light the stage and I prefer just to stage when I'm naked so right at it after a hot bath I should've said that before and I didn't\nUm you just said and between your legs and you'll stage all around your body mostly around your head and especially behind your head because that's where entities like two to hang out [noise] um so every\nCrevice in your body just going to stage um and it works if you do it forty days in a row if you said your house and you said yourself you'd definitely will fill a difference\nOh I Hope that works for your Charlotte Allen in Fresno, California is with us now while I'm going to\nGo and bus um I have a question of how do you get a ... and you know\nHow do you get rid of spirits great question you're gonna have to email me for that because it's going to be more lengthy um I can give you um information on how to do ... now what kind of spirits I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know what do you wake up in the morning what how how serious or the ...\nIs is like um I wake up in the middle of the night and you're ... you're going to talk and then and then when I go into the causes no one's\nOkay so you probably have ... what is known as a a called an earth bounce spirit so it can be someone\nSounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not like the men it's probably just as maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nOn to use a possible ... that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit but uh just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked um there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nBoundary and wanted me ... ... oh [laughter] well usually my magician girls\nI Know I'm Sorry and clarify a magician and it can actually send you an earth mounds spirit and what they do is they will go and um\n[noise] look for spirits at the cemetery who have an crossed over and they will um make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send a spirit to you and if that happens actually quite frequently\nThe under the control of Lucia per se\n[noise] the dark lord ah absolutely I definitely have been dark lord exists\nIt was when you should somebody's sons though that's who I think is sending them\nWell it depends because the always the the evil magicians are definitely being manipulated by the dark lord and and you know other demon so in a in a in a sense yes absolutely\nYou're going to war zones you got to watch all commercials what side username ... dot com she'll answer\nAll your questions when you email and that way things gruesome appreciate your being on the program ... who's beyond the group\nDoing the show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with him we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom Dan highs or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight I'm\nA I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the shows to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to tricky aren't really creative I remember\nWhen the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not guess him at all\nHe had you and I think in honey and\nIt was good to in he won't even was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nA in this nine will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes next Wednesday Halloween Night or you're putting together a number of uh email ghost stories from people and will have the actual people on the year with me that night\nUh and of course we'll take calls from our listeners to what their ghost stories so we're ready to go there\nReady to go to ship enough to be a fun show we're going to honor\nOkay Thanks Tom okay so let's open up the first secret door\nGosh I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd how you doing\nOh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\nKnow not and not for ... days up\nOh I don't know I got older things get tough for\nIts tend to read more hits Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed the\nHeightened guy you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell or it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to Olympic demand hunger\nAnd yes you are nine we need we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in on teen years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December can't believe it two months of outgoing anywhere\nAh against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you why we love your standard I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News\nThat he was going to be speaking before group\nOr an uncle in university and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder\nOut I once interviewed Stanton Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming where there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo and ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field of you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nThe latest word gap looks like they're about one point six climates per star not bring galaxy star and our galaxy\nThe Milky Way has about a hundred billion store all that main one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave hunting you\nRoom in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know get to hear from there is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that the you know it's got to take a very long time many years to get between stars and they can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're fusion for example or you\nCan get ... or\nWe also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand ... see\nThat's right it can be filming beings around you know\nWell he was off a little bit four billion be seen as\nThey are just a little the little\nUh our natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her family [noise] um we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and\nThere should be no surprise that people see others coming here\nBecause apparently they seem to be all over the place that was the result them\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere on migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that a mirror throwing some climate that they put an incarcerated people you know\nAnd they had bought this guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people it's it's it's a Sandy you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially you're still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ...

George Parker Parker I'm thinking of the ... board with Parker Brothers you're right and that's got to where you have you been Karen\nI have been doing great Georgia how about you and I'm great together we just didn't act like\nEverything's sure enough for people who need to know who you are Karen ... is the ... board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say we need you Portland tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board Historical Society ... so we diversify and all things ... board\nMarlin ... a more moral Martinson believes the you're the greatest ... personnel author\nWell she's very kind let's say it that way she's very ...\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves Luigi board folks as you know I'm opposed to it I don't want to use it when Karen feels very secure with a I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nGeorge has to do with\nThe user your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also what people forget it has to do with your own perceptions believe in what you think about and how you view yourself within the world or even if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nFor the place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around the world changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow these evil spirits and entities to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and so I've been won't believe and that they're earning power that they're just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength then and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that\nKind of ... and beyond that kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating in communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the war that I Do with this tool is no different at somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your attention that\nYou use it only as a tool you have there's no hidden spirits and view or power inside of these chunk of wood or of cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of\nIts within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in these Ralph\n... have you ever had a bad ... no I haven't had\nBad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing at me once and the more and this was many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty through through the board they were costing the board\nBut let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm like standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse and so the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have board\nOn a diet and going good and going and that's\nIt and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs about where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful of everything that's on the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment with me that I could really\nA strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it than just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving the plant ya Karen is it the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving well let me answer\nThat from a few different directions one as many people believe is India motor effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles through the power suggestion is making the plants shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or mid ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back\nTo the Eighteen hundreds that's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plants at the moving spell out messages\nThat's Beijing worked with that happens in really absolutely\nAmazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked to him before I talked about um before on your show and work with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say when\nYou come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning the frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect to the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows the messages to slow the plan to move and for the for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half worth ... your questions and maybe you are ... board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you though Karen to put somebody down if they don't like to read you born and that I appreciate\nWell I you know that that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness and this talk a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness Roche and I'm not for\nThat I'm for having discussion about it I'm for people having different opinions this tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use a tool this kind of floor are different one so I think it's great to become together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group that talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a among stuff without us believe it doesn't work some of some of his leaves it works because if you didn't motor and a few of us might believe it works because we're actually connected with an energy outside of herself\nIt just
