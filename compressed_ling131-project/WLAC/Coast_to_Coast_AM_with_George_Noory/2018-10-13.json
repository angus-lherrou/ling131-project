Arizona\nSuddenly the daughter explained why she was driving the father was in the bunk getting some rest she explained very loudly for her father to get up into the cabin immediately he didn't know what was going on so he jumped up and his daughter described a very peculiar event\nShe had seen a what she thought was a meteor going from North to south in front of her truck as she drove to the east\nAnd about two minutes later looking in approximately the same direction she saw a disc shaped object\nShe described it as being parents do or paradox grain I have no idea what paradise is but it's somewhere between yellow and green descend vertically and here we're here's where it gets really exciting and George the daughter according to the father's account and this is posted to our

any sense\nThat even even little things mean everything goodies and people's that part of our states family ...\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guess George but important thing to remember is that they're there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and\nThere's a lot of negative emotional energy strong ...\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments in so doing negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environment\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free is I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all\nPeople call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything any ways we can personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes they're already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment\nAnd they're ripe for attack and so\nIt's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies their energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which called me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for the rest of the ah we're coming up to the top of the

forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six\nAnd he's wearing Nashville gums for talk talk radio Fifteen ten W. L. A. C. [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey Schumann with us we'll get your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what is meant for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a stand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's\nSomething I was against for years and years and years for fuse all invitations I finally uh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and ah so ah it was essentially set up\nFor ghost hunters to go in and uh with her quit and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh\nI was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room and it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know this place is really haunted and third night I was there\nUm I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning men can be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite need\nYeah because Obama people home negative spirit's just they will get\nYou know to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the\nSay the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song\nThat I'd never heard really is I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was\nNot any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by and it was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in the bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick ... and I could hear it loud and clear\nJust horrific song slowly\nAnd I'd just I'd you know ... shot up immediately got up out of my bed and ... it kinda went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I Try to change me a from being very happy\nAnd sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at the at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night uh giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just have to learn\nAn exorcist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the\nCalls come pretty quickly you know in times immediately you know it's like you know we feel\nBetter right away especially when I Do a personal Claire and I do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed\nBecause they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious\nAnd so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit and so you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot\nJeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround six people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on\nThe business or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people thing\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's ...\nShe fields both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy\nSchools people go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon Leonard she didn't see any\nLaid it and so people become uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good long term costs just for you know most\nAll energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about ... and everything else but Jeffrey\nYou treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and I have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war\nUm after I went through that what happened often we'd you board followed me as it said it would [noise] and I've lost\nTwo families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated\nMan and I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried cleansing my house with stage and everything else [noise]\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the jury for the other question go ahead Jerry\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches ... beach and the guy go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many minutes years out there that each or this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is\nWith this with this whole scenario as it turns the off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion if it if it's the relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell trained or you have to be God man Jesus title is Jean\n... Lord Jesus Christ lord and have the genes this means humanity and cry and only did one [noise] okay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the third in fact in fact Peter said\nThat I'm a I I that God is no respect or person so we're all in the same boat no matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God because we have a nature\nBecause where where warning stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then ah our entire life\nWe we are and and even all that is that that none of it started the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seem to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\nGhost insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm going to end now Android for ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nScreen along with W.

negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness a overconfidence\nAll sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits are experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden demonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power\nSuddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it because it the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle\nSo it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark romas that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm I think of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\nWe'll home polish on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or ordered\nTrip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves\nWhy don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to ... still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job\nYou don't have time for spirits out there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing\nIt's not my job and people who hire me\nWork for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch he's gonna he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's disaster or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit aren't clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nYour every are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nI Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary 'cause when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nI'm On for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call in you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they lived it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is feeling better that's what it's all about

Prozac\nPanacea [noise] or I Am for Thirty years his research government approved prescription mind altering trucks uh regarding your previous guest she actually says that ah another name for ... which is one of the holy Bible or pharmacology\nI Believe and [noise] and she said\nThat uh that actually among some of the bad effects of these government approved prescription mind altering drugs including F F horizon added raffles or that they create\nActual portal or negative dark and he couldn't demonic spirits but they also a interfere with people's ability to\nHave a spiritual\nThing positive spiritual experiences including belief in God some people when they go on the trunk space stop believing in God [noise]\nThere is a boy who is featured in a Youtube video and like Tracey and I hope everybody can watch why cook gone to school and in that he is uh basically describe this when he went on these medications um\nWas waking dream state\nAnd uh he he didn't know the difference between reality and um you know his delusions and what he was doing and it almost ended up very tragically hit it going to jail for this boy\nLots of people do yeah but he he later you know got out a because the people knew that there is really something wrong with this this boy they belong there didn't believe that he really was responsible for that and sure enough you know it was going to the medications\nBut they believed him [noise] but\nBelieved him yeah and and what I'm what I Want to talk about is what he believed that he was experiencing in this way can dream state which\nIs common and trace is about all these cases and even which includes suicide and domestic violence workplace violence she's federally suitcases with the school shootings or involve kids that\nWere not on not on these drugs now you know and so the\nBottom line is what I'm suggesting that is that it's possible that because some of the side effects are uh the dilution hallucinations\nAnd I am Tracy has a false memories center article about a Roseanne Barr who accused her parents of molesting her\nAnd later and that was after she was on the medication that's right\nAnd then later she she realized that that was not correct at all and she was really certain that it had happened but uh but but then you know she\nAnd she would only ask one off of that she would have passed a lie detector test because she believed it\nExactly and so this is what a I think is important for people that know and and who has a documented thousands of cases over the thirty years of the things and what I'm saying you know in in my previous call and I I didn't get to\nInclude all of this but I but basically I had a dream in which it was very vivid\nI had mentioned that you know I was told by somebody who had died twenty five days before that he would feed me and Thirteen months and I said how do you now when he said the holy ghost told me [laughter] and\nAnd I I you know I knew it was a dream\nAnd but the ... I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and wasn't a loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream\nBut what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream\nFruit she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them if they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that but we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know and you'll okay where are you\nAre I'm engaged hanging um I had a um the thing you could lose believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know\nAnd um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if they do all this you know and I started reading the Bible\nAnd then I'm going back to the point when I was out of the gym and a a ... and I was like well if\nYou know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I it's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened when I\nStarted seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight and it seemed like everybody and he had Koreans eat everything he did he touch with no I mean you have a one my ... in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay now these kids that you know\nYou go oh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter]\nBut he didn't have one at that time and I'm leaving it was kind of me just to show me that you know how it works or you know Indian\nSo I bought a church in a ...
