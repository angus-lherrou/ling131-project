coast to coast am and we will not disappoint both tomorrow night and tonight or coming up uh again tomorrow night the uh the book that I think you will love hear the story of demand from the train\nOr as scary as a story is um it's still not as scary in some respects as some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen was Clint joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place\nIn America and uh and when cameras\nCaptured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment and coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel\nOn the top of the Web site at coast to coast am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City era our parents to leave that

starts to move that Andy ... next to it\nI said okay no positive here for a new we'll just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to come\nAnd look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know\nYour ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's\nFan Michael well uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spend a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked the uh uh\nUh later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way uh my we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing alot terrific come in and you know she's\nA she's a frequent guest here and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what\nHappens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and wish you talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen if she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and but I mean I what what\nIs the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicate in science I\nTry to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at a ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've tried to cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that are Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um [noise]\nWhat I ... in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic rope so that Larry King can\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the world Wide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of a you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in ...\nLike you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of a mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nHave an aunt at Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years a Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an export into wisdom and Buddhism and Islam in transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I like I was not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my age very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist ... well there are some innovations in this book\nThat I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should\nWe then that's where we go with the next pitch the plastic studies so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it [noise] just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list [noise] next on coast to coast am\nListen while you're W.

you don't want to miss ed coming up tomorrow night but what's um what's giving me goose bumps tonight is the lift up for Michael Guillen what are the things that science is on the threshold of

Fifteen ten W well lazy [noise]\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical lights are on this planet\nMore facile [noise]\nYeah yeah you're you're you're raising a good point you know I Do talk about these\nThe extinction efforts that are going on right now I'm that are primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nAnd I I remember when I was at ABC News I was actually invited to come to Russia where\nThere there there were a group of scientists I think the French guy was in charge of the group as I recall and\nHe wanted me to come up and covered the story I never got around to doing it I got busy doing other stories but what they had done as they they had carved out an entire woolly mammoth a carcass if you will but pretty well preserved because it was the ice\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know\nDo we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's nice to you and I was not nice to mother nature\nYou know that the one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we've got to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you\nKnow a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a ... year peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped\nLaunch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuits are feeling a industrial secrets and so forth and so on but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nYou know on the surface of sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into\nWhat the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they can control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay\nOn its good side because he did that this technology we're creating\nWill run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's\nNot that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I probably won't smoke\nYou write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I\nMean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just\nDoing computations 'em but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that\nWell you know like you they're ... it just buttoned up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than right than we would have possibly the imagine so\n... are like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose\nA yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how is raising was at the right now I fully believe that completely senator and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile then people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael ... lost to shoot the numbers coming up and about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation and then it's open lines for the rest of the night\nCoast to coast

I Know several people who have a ... who have\nA trouble walking or they have lost their ability to walk and they've been spinal injuries and and this to them as a dream ... you're just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a call the trans human movement where\nAs you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside I mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who\nHe was a power lines when he touched\nA high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms that them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat require you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I ... them isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even um even in a military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just it it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons\nI I think that's a I\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we could come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead\nTo what this technology is pointing to [noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are\nEqually realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon\nUh using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes do you get such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah\nNations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now and another escalating arms race so right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know\nYeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nThat's at Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for a million or some terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nUh and his weaknesses but but positive for setting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nKidding me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in what line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe it there in the Saudi consulate they have a they have Google and they had the little ... theory whenever there and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um the Chinese\nAre hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer that that kind of a ... year treasury rate or your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the

L. A. C. [noise]\n\n\nMichael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we get because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing the these women wearing a fit if one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so\nThey downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nAs as I remember being told by an aunt of mine that a a a cousin that was being born in the family wouldn't have a soul because she was a test tube babies\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I'm like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's were great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this\nBook you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] and how they're I think you you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and\nIt says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up and are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse a summer camp as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation [noise]\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd so beyond the you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on ... you know getting ... getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where\nYou know you're you're like try and everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher ... so ... that actually were those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say it's really interesting about the Bible\nIn this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to David who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for me I'm ... and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and then or if they really just losing it just left them oh\nNo Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but um\nI've been I kicking machine going on forty five years yes or no macular degeneration\nI'd like you know from your guest or would you feel that the shoe will be overcome through Chris or or uh it'd be a journey either by pigs\nI'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very helpful um they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joy till spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next done coast to coast am

Kurt ... I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of the things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore it our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situation is and\nThere are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for that is families with multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not he is\nOur use of all wrong and we don't know even with training we don't know if the supplies which is ... somebody who was in a\nCave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt that on your way to um volunteer myself not to a consuming somebody's supplies\nBut just chew on my cell and my child\nEven I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies they just see somebody could even his thing then sell\nAn interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive that could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored up in these codes are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ... I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just would be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do\nBut to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's a series called uh like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and they are they following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and wouldn't even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but ah yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid a John is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of your commercial market goes to the pawn shop in the record that was their name was Andy Gomez remember Gomez or the monsters yeah\nSure looked upon gung ho you know a now\nNow you mentioned the young lady mentioned about the woolly mammoth and you know Howard could survive a first of all wouldn't survive the five gee cellphone radiation or the ... over today\nBy some [noise] getting back you know back in\nMay a coast to coast published and a picture of a police force that washed up on the beach of George ... beach I Believe it was [laughter]\nAnd the scientists claimed that it was ... decompose body of a basking shark now check out a Baskin sharp a totally different you know\nA messy doesn't have get off it doesn't have a dorsal fin it has a a very small mouth um [noise] uh so you know we're being led astray there now I I'm On the phone number of things that I don't want to pick up a lot of your time I'd regarding the caller about the mortality of revelation nine [laughter]\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a\nVisited him from the spirit world and delivered a message for him to give to\nTheir parents and so anyway this individual by the way it's the same breath I'm now and that in a at the edge of Ninety three after having been on a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having less is world renowned medical career\nBecame credit to the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three\nAnd a an amazing man even at the um downhill skier at that age\nUm [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and let her things and which\nI'm sure he'll back across the judge gave a little bit more in height and I'm ...

it's you know people often talk about Islam and the ... you know they make all these characterizations about Muslims and it's it's really unfair\nBecause murder any kind of death anytime you're killing something that's a big deal in a slump\nAnd so the fact really the elevation is really my point was that they were elevating the death of Jesus by using the word murder\nOr they weren't

I'm more in line with like Quakers and I'm fascinated with the idea\nOf um the beginning of an age and when they get the current age began is there disagreement about\nThat and oh yeah that is is that I'm going because\nTheir current I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or\nIn this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism in post modernism Marxism and Neal Marxism and you know all we can never do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ...

know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona in right or soon to be a a a cans and isn't a didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to your philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need

we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day as I had my son was born in Boston and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that and that's why a ... a a later on or\nIf you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think an elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to really tell me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest you're in the ... very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what\nHappens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the\nThings that would happen is she is very I Love it you know she's grey and you'd really like her in this very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I\nTry to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at a ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the Huck basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can uh\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what
