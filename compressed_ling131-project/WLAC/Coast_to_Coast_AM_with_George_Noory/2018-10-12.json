publishes the newsletters economy in markets boom and bust and the leading edge among many others she has an MBA from Harvard\nWas a consultant for several fortune one hundred companies wallet Benin company in lectures widely across the globe his latest book that came out in November of two thousand Seventeen zero hour\nHarry what is going on with the stock market my friend\nOr you know we've been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or if we can hold for just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction here which are pretty close to that\nUm we may make it you know and the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by six ten trillion dollars are free money printed\nSince two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than early two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed or\nYou know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct in or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years\nLike a clock and we're coming right on that clock in stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nDo you buy back in when things hit the bottom\n[noise] you you know that's the secret George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high\nOh the bonds and make money which she did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down but the biggest bonuses it'd be preserved your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and just short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna hundred dollars\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world in which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollar know next time it goes to four thousand instead of two thousand so\nNo that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much as it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the\nSale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip when one of the indicators market the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause is uh just panic or ... what's happening\nSo the low interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kind of\nWent sideways and in the laboratory emerging countries want on a spree and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're three hundred trillion in debt financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd those are cracking you see turkey blowing up the seat Venezuela with hyperinflation runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash\nBecause they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop it they just build a top backup with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\n... absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad Harry stay with

gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not end well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd upon Amazon there oh my God I was\nThat's why how he won he picked off\nThe far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans bullied him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats\nHated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time\nSouth seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time especially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument in its argument hatred bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter]\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the ... the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our news letters than Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know here we had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September a news one fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called the leash me\nYeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then\nBut you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest in that\nWell that's not good to when I was just going to last night and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or it best when Trump was on and noticed that we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting power\nNext to the end of next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nAnd the forty percent we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes China went down a little bit in China made the biggest ... was the only stock market it violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more of a came back up to eat but it's still violated but the U.S markets looked like the Dow is going to open up two to three hundred point them are now that minor compared\nTo fourteen hundred points over just the last\n... stay with us

heart rate\nPerfect for decorating the house or just letting the theory mood\n\n\nAnd welcome back to go to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nBoom the difference is George is that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been a commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but\nBetween now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more on the downside of after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes and young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we just for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world man makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time\nAnd then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this is zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out this is a major war between the\nThe leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat and they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nNot tourists on let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in

to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're going to take your deposits and worked in a kind of ... them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nOther than you need to pay your bills shouldn't be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm on on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's

more fluent accounts [noise]\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and got may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst\nAnd and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTo thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative\nYou think for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent\nEasing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and\nThe rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send to try to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say that but if if they just sent everybody at twenty ... every household with twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefitted corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being in bed but you don't write if\nThey don't spend it or they got you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nWell hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh they taking the money I'm typing and like what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems worse farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have takes procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nRight now yeah okay thank you and I think yeah I guess and think that part of one of my question but I asked\nA direct tonight at ... at one point in my way around ... fly or not but I'm like hey I'm going to come back on line\n... yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my garden along with that comment I'm here at talk of that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as um as a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting for those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposited more Iceland\nWent down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a\nProtected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time Harry's website at ... dot com up next a psychiatrist looks at

of experience working in the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University now throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the home\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or anomalous experiences visions pre cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with the message Barry nap or Russians as well\nWelcome to the program Dr many mate is on the coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnd are inviting\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died from anytime you know when my book to but it's not my first came out many people ask me\nBook was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential a doctor is bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patients and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many Russians that that um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's climate document moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago it was right\nNow I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans has either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of this seems after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had the classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then he and an increase need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual the first um couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of that might just kind of brush them off you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them but then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and\nWhen I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\n... the the stem cell transplant so why do they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous stem cells donor it's called in how Jeanette transplant\nMhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer or this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOne of those super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nWas was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses\nAnd that's why against that they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy and when his name came up\nOn the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThe abuse still in touch with them the happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life\nAnd it is here altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive in one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required his cheeks swab type that's it\nYeah just to ... to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang\nAnd then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live\n... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nAnd Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your ... your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have no serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post deaf contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say you're a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post deaf\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs or belief in an afterlife\nUm and in fact you know atheist agnostic have these experiences well as religious people you\nSee that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you agree with you OK but when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pre cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions some voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of psychic experiences such as ESP\nAnd collapse of the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that person then you say oh you must be said you have just thinking about you right\nVery common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences\nAnd so I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to their but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nUm the AG could measure what we call them sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the average rent dream state the Centers for giving random images and they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them to be seafood and they found that people were more susceptible to let it can lead to the when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more\nSusceptible to see when they're under hypnosis\nSo there are ways to augment fuzzy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say

paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who's dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened to my dad when he gets in the hospital he saw his\nLate sister he mentioned oh this phone so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm\nSaid someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them a mess\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say is coming from something they've read or we could say it's coming from the spirit world\n[noise] you know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\n... you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about a group of people governmental who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know they want to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\n[noise] [noise] well that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of\nGetting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and how how would we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't it the cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I thought I I just saw these words that said\nThis is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their permission stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should go after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was the horse racing and bow yes one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else some loss\nIn ... in movies screaming at you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that it is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe that they don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nWanted his teeth background yeah have you\nBack but then then they said I don't know why put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were well yeah it works it would that work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual components life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's ...\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them psychic some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr Mr polar mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe\nThe same events so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nNext when we come back with Dr many ...\nSo we're going to take phone calls your calls your stories about pre cognitive dreams and so many of the things you've heard us talk\nAbout here on the coast to coast am

what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors\nAs a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether the person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the fake from a psychotic experience for example if someone hears the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and in fact it may be\nMore than one voice to hear the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once had price in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and climbing the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than as a side from the ... for example the thought to order or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\n... you played talking but then this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened there is a psychologist that did an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients while they were patients they were actors pretending\nTo be ...\nThat they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the word the patients that they were faking so\nThey were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their parents their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come the doctors couldn't figure that out\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true but but the patients that and\nI think because well the patients live with it they they know the ... thought well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that said All right\nLet's take some calls for your Judy in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in that had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have left my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they get all the major planning for their European front\n... well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were out in spirit that not legal\nAnd they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be there\n[laughter] but you did that it is a remote viewing huh\nI ...
