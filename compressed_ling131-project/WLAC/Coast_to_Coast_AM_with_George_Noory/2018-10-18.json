go go wasn't going to get into the technical details on this the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty\nThat's weird well it it's interesting because um as we\nKnow that the the actual video streams to people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so the fact that this was a global outage suggests that there was some kind of access related problem centrally that caused this in my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I were to YouTube dot com or you'd normally get all those little thumbnail\nIt would just get the shadows with typically appear before the video from the ... of that with the wouldn't actually get the video [noise]\nSo uh it's an interesting ... interesting situation apparently uh there were people tracking where everyone when when

I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fared ... practice laws federal um a fruit in lending laws uh\nAnd these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of\nBankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprises\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices trees in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars\nA year well I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course\nFor a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the backs of students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but\nAlso really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\n... there was a story just recently we're losing\nA guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder if that's all a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond in shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and in many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be felt\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back if you've got a student loan give us a call if you've got a question give us a call\nIf you're an instructor at a university and he wanted to give us your feedback on that give us a call as well we'll be back in a moment with Ellen calling on your phone calls right here on the coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am app is now available for iPhone and now Android ... listen live on demand anywhere any time when I go to go to go see 'em dot com and downloaded today\n\n\nThis goes to goes day em on TALK radio Fifteen ten W well ac [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was that Alan that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I've three degrees in engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance et cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add [laughter] uh and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later\nAnd Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credit\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got the student loan situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great\nAnalogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\n... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and\nThey're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting lower interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more in schools but\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen ...\nWill cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you\nI got good news for a two man a trope rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they throw support the seal day and he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to\nA ... a former company I used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a totally went under the owners of the night a private plane crash no mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but uh we pretty much going on there and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I Love her job over here and then I found one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast because I didn't have that little piece of paper saying to them they would all too\nWell and I said well ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just for oh I think it was a two month course there's no well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going unless ... thousand dollars on the grades loaf are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not a surprise that we've been talking\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place so\nTo Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nA private bank and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program\nSort of a bunch of government programs out there that sounds like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment but\nWhat all everybody out there needs to know is that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you\nWork for a you know if you work in a college or hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being just qualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals rate probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nDo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that has you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\n... going to say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they just send all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back

... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Alan RT scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time

before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans in the fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know\nAre listed a breakdown of all of a a a cost but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can get me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight uh first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back\nSo that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm the owner of your loan is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a question of you know like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information al unlucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public jak clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so I definitely\nRecommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nMy niece lives down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave [noise]\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan\nBe glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have a ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order

try and do what you mean tree fell as fast as I can tell the story of US government don't want any relationship with the\nPhenomenon watch decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering the town that has been the biggest thing go wherever they are the UFO community I think that I the only story that I think comes\nAnd I would say this is the vacation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that\nOften decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort program after when it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence agency I'm an agency of the day and\nYou're like hey oh yes they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this with knowing trash or no investigations and of course\nThey were and what do I really focused on in in the film aliens and to get to try\nTo train angle the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this Robert Bigelow Senator Harry Reid combed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up you\nKnow you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer to that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one [noise]\nYears people have said the\nProblem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times when they are they a\nLandmark story on this on December sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a than a third one\nBut now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this walk stone guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman and and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's\nThat's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in the course tonight and then they're gone but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a a diverge and for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and then you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you can sit in the hot seat a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this and when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... oil from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... this thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way\nI have absolute control of this and then literally I went into a a recording studio you know you\nHad it all ... headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and ... than\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it\nFrom from start to finish and that's a departure from me and they took completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a\nA a great movie but um\nYou know I I was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish within the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go ahead on to the platforms\nThat the young people need to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google playing food too and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take their subjects not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but to young people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people\nUm and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so they ... at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite the U.S and put it by where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization doing nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization I'm E. T. I. P. O.\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well it always says in these sorts of situations I eat as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that\nHe he says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in the proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism and he might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm but that skepticism is ... those sorts of\nNicole or intellectual\nOr humanists skepticism that I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it it said the probably trying to build the trip and skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the Pentagon um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so we'll at least by these people and skeptics told\nThey would believe those but they would you believe us in some some great more in heaven with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can get you up dates with other ... would you do in the ... the school just go to these ... dot coms to go see him in my book [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n...

I think people so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work more that has the ministry you did\nYeah I absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nWe saw that any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well\nYou know locate Soviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some ... that sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact scenario probably one ... but if it does the payoff is so big wine on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about ... son street can Stargate the ministry defense going into this briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd did a study which which was classified I think the ... only it's now classified and only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it said that it it wasn't a very good study I have to say\nIt um didn't live in the last ... some of the U. S.\nPrograms and on because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they work so much in silos but they didn't go out and talk to the people that they probably should have to I some of the people involved in Stargate and real frame and from the tree\nWhat do you what do you think of rumors about a congressional hearing on your phones ... ...\nYes it has I and actually this this is a big breaking news story literally just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors I'm only know from\nReliable sources but the Senate um service um Services Committee\nHas already started looking at the two thousand four ... incident which of course was the focus of of some of these\nThese be classified videos that we've been talking about they've interviewed at least to the pilot and I think one of the radar arthritis so so we have the Senate\nArmed services committee involved we also in parallel have the house armed services committee involved and if you look at the congressional record\nFor the house armed services committee dated April ... you will see a paragraph tucked away in ... I think it's run through about forty three forty four pages but All right there on the second page paragraph for three I\nWon it says that the CIA say ... supply the committee with a briefing on\nBasically what I did\nNick when we come back we'll talk more about these rumors of congressional hearings and then we'll take phone calls spine law were just ahead with Nicole bunk coast to coast the mind more about tonight just log on to ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n... to fit into your workload but what if there were a ... method you need ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound in pastas degree then further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that\nDegree in his little sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text crowd to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P R O U D to seven nine six four or five\nStar you're on line NBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

well let's get back into these talks of congressional hearings would you think could happen it could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nSong ... coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee in the house\nArmed services committee have been looking for ... ... ... have been doing and secondly I think by interest has said wait until the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the\nChair of of the uh science technology and space committee and the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolves into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings be as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly it was a a military and intelligence program and I I just don't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks in its terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay\nA mystery it's it's bad so so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is low being going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that have actually going into the fine but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nNo bomb us one us no not yet\nNo no thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster results are doing what they do to get the word ... neck\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately he got the chance one one of the things is I now do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with aliens and again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes when you're writing documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed services\nCommittee interest and I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering ... before articles I've seen about this all for it and I'm a British not one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course off off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we'd only write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's a the online version but now I guess my ... my reaction should be well great like\nGets exactly gets the attention [laughter] absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies hey Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again hey hey\nAh first of all you had that you open up the show about a special report about working less in being at home\nAnd yeah yeah I got I got\nI co signed for student loan you know kind of stuff so I I gotta work\n[laughter] but anyway I make great ... great\nCrew time of your top notch guy but a Mitt what an honor it is to talk to you my my rent or not my friend but third great honor thank you Brian hey listen I my wife and I are eight namely why a lot that pretty religiously\nAnd in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like number fourteen or something like that to come out in the fifties\nThat they they sign they said they scientifically proved to UFOs didn't exist now you said earlier that uh some of the believers in your new book or a movie or we're ... we're we're the people that they ran into the disc labor were people from project we book\nAnd I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up you'd\nWork thanks Bryan we'll talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the Condon Report\n[noise] yes um that that was um of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear\nThat they wanted just to get out of the UFO business or at least they want it to the public out and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the winding up of project Blue Book\nUm which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous\nUh Poland a memo\nWhich which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for ... sake\nAnd on ... part of the blue book system so so in other words the clue with there all along that that you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long now how many years well\nMy goodness ah I guess I was appointed to the British Government fewer project in Nineteen Ninety One so uh yeah that's more years ago and I can't mention of of course I did that for much of the early nineties and
