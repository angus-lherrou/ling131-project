the book I think that a lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things\nOver the years I think I could look back um to college when you have a beer bottle of beer that sounded twist off but you don't have an opener um but somebody always had a big later on them and I got taught a kind of the party trick of being able to to wedge a bottle of beer open with a lighter um\nAnd then you know kind of accumulated some others along the way and then you know like it was\nSilly enough to talk to an editor um themselves with silly enough to say we should make this a book\n[laughter] the uh the big lighter that's if I follow along correctly in the book that is a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against the tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there hum with illustration diagrams a and everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're essentially using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a fulcrum\nUm so it's all highly scientific as you can do\nEnd up for those in desperation mode even holding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nI think yeah that's a great one that one's actually um something of a bar bet to where you tell people buy but chicken open this year with a piece of paper that way and\nAh you fold that six or seven times until you have a

way through the beer a and you can turn it into a a glass to drink a glass to then put beer in um I'd recommend you know sending\nHeavily uh just to protect your mouth\nI'm can create TV charges or that you can put outside to ward off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this uh mosquitoes love people who've been drinking beer so you gotta\nGotta fight 'em off um [noise] yeah there's a a number of other you can make shot glasses I'm with the basically the the bottle next um that you've severed off\nFrom the bottle and yeah I think there's like some some fun stuff to do and I think all these things or you know better than getting five cents at the recycling center\nNice bin bin ... then

Institute in Virginia\nAnd William sounds as a suicide therapist and he guide you through these incredible states as hunch and I personally know that they exist from my experience in love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show thanks for joining William\nHi how are you feeling good side\nHe'll tell me first of all what led you to even create such a system such that I had out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer in the ... be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a\nBeliever but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your ... your\nTire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality has shifted\nOh yeah it is that now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise\nUh that I\nThat I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. will get you go what did you experience how did you know that this was this atmosphere\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and\nYou fall asleep at night and the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you reach the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but\nIt was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing\nMay um but they didn't I didn't\nCommunicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I at first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhat I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system mhm I always\nYou know incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information in me why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once you have these experiences\nYou realize that the universe is multi dimensional [laughter] and and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms yeah and not all human\nAnd it has to be it wouldn't just be one that did not want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and union of their meal because especially they feel real you aren't you blame them because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat another mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes I there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the\nTruth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really tell us what to look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia I'm only twenty four people can attend\nIt's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um\nWhen is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation booth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nMm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after a a tragic incident national tragic incident where ... one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences\nUh during nine eleven and myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time\nUm that was a that was one of the original facts where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way about junior having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body it's called ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its functions and different names and different cultures\nGoing up to the Institute we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can ... that goes\nFor all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because really allow the person to have their own experience but then all of that I Want to find out a little bit more about what other

or their vibrating\nOr they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean ... when you are when people are going to the travels the game to he mapped the brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery\nOr twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're\nThey're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught any\nMore interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these what is a mind near twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just the device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device um\nYou know in our class we will have a four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\n[noise] but it is it that that that's\nOne of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body

I'm a retired I Will switch and\nI think it's his muscles nurse you're saying that's an out of body say no I'm I'm\nAnd it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experiences I've seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLosing ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream the can or\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc it temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nDidn't ... biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what\nThis multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into and it'll be and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how did you hear me now an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way\nYou know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank I\nMean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us\nOr we open to these experiences and we get to download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's not needing to be validated verify ... anyone other than you know\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left of specialty uh religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe that you would have been born in India ah eh we're all been\nProgrammed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nAnd it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\nMm need in ... back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... you know\nThe average age and the first Adam ... hearing things ... years old people recruit recount Canton and it's often heated experience happened over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you get that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest just a sec says something to do with it\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the ... that we tend to get in with his camera ... news that\nWe hadn't ridiculous and that's and\nYou realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core\nIssue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being not no ...\nNone of that would occur mhm because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that do connect [laughter]\nWell we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick Brinkley and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls says he'll give us a call and [noise] I only think I

I see it and I actually feel it\nOn ... like humans to examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today\nI was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nAnd managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was\nLike oh this will be fun and kids get this\nWe are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California is a time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first\nOrder of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans\nAnd said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after\nUs and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] yeah\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps\nDo what you want he goes my mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nDo you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that while I hired twenty\nPeople um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you jumping allowed\nLou ... everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named\nBeautiful hiking trails that we had in my house is shaking my head and never find true north I kid you not the the end of the American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in the second place in the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just carrying it so that the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up and he um you can feel it um and the other thing that curious about it is that because these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas\nActually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as the bird um we're just\nGoing over managing spring was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense they're ready to find their way true north or south was gone and you know they have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain\nAnd it was the he was he must be leading that maybe because of these magnetic anomalies bred for hunting confused because\nThey were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like ...

Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that\nWere drawn to manage it springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American\nTribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nAnd the ghost is gone it worked\nSo the manager confirmed that\nSnow yes all of this worked up beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating now had she seen the operation of this not since\nThe book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball and all this was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes but you seem to be the you'd like to publish this for the east coast and the [laughter]\nYou I think that is the main thing is\nIt's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you you do the research is like a real

I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not\nYou know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the boats that come out at midnight you know but Tom or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to\nActually look for those if you want to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself\nTo the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make straps when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is a place that you're

thought that the street lights and managed to or on a timer because whenever I Would walk on her name's lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know it'd be certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would\nOn when you've locked underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter] so they really\nDo communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and I went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah because I happen to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and yeah and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nI'm trying to say it's happening it won't so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm like no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and manage we springs that you know we're also carry that type of energy and absolutely Estes\nPark right in there\nOh yeah but you know this family hotel right there on that a native them it's very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a there's us [noise]\nI have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down on managed to springs and bolder and even as to part with as a with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up\nLight up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine is you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the world the pikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very low fat Ernie I Love this stuff [laughter]\nPikes peak it's very popular and it has a lot of um a lot of stories around and hopefully I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it\nAnd we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay now the name of your book again is called the latest one you have for\nAt five five minutes all came about after cancer was on my bucket list I'm a big believer in manifestation\nAnd you find now in fine and it's wonderful and I hope I hope to God thank you for Apple ... All right we're going to come back and find out about them you know [laughter]\nAll right my guess is definitely waters and we will be right back at least the guy you're listening to decode\nThe\nGoogle Facebook and even television recall thing who have time to sit and watch TV so we want to connect with all those constantly moving adult things and millennials go to our media dot com and put am FM radio to work for your company\nOctober fourteen what's new today on the free our radio our heart radio talk\n\nDo you expect ...\nWhole lot more backyard looking Greek wrong when I was planning on voting no one could contractors why don't you just ... home one\nHome advisor dot com you just told me about your project match you with local Rosa can do the job is of course the home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews pricing and ...\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just do little to bring home advisor\nLike your son's Facebook just to go to W. Willie C. dot com bubble [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and we're talking about Colorado legends and lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore spiritual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters in mineral rich area in that particular region of the U. S. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well I'm Pete I think it was called T. T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native youth used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe\nI just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why would call that connected to the mother okay yeah it's\nConnected to the mother and think about the native as the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it on during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I\nHope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient alien and they talk about that that we had a lot of UFO sightings silver pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on the ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the\nAll metal mining camp especially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk hearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that\nSaw UFO when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it's cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships and they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards it other than it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is\nAmazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally before there was like\nYeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brush it off as being an airplane but before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the fist it\nMhm erratic flight ... up and down sideways harboring you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating\nAnd they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not that it's a lot of\nPeople out yet but a lot of people thought that I mean just outrageously crazy\nAnd he found his story in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's there was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web could possibly know when farmers\nIn Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know [noise] um well we you know that we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit or a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal convention and one of my friends is a named Dan Mathias and he lives in the mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak and um he saw\nWe would do [noise]

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out\nNo I was not quite I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized\nIt was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking\nI was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here and a ...\nOver the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that were in\nIt doesn't stop it couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all of the tens information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nAnd that\nAnd that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and it has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and union of their meal because just suddenly they feel real you can you blame them because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an ... is a universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes I there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes ... each each ... tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invasion only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being\nThe center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um\nWhat is that controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation\nBoth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization to kind of technology plus guided meditation\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm\nAt a ... that the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses\nOn that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist them in crossing or have you ever done this after a a tragic incident and national tragic incident where ... one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences\nUh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone\n... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions in different names and different cultures\nBut and then I went to ... we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can that goes\nFor all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really loud a person to have their own experience and all that I Want to find out a little bit more about what other cultures I got this and what it\nCalls and other cultures are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can get it on your own and and live like that but my guess William moment I Am an argument because the test and\nFind out more about you and I guess to log on to ... dot com\nAllowing\nThem\nListen online or on your mom and I are ... are you willing\nLet some early shower steady arranged for the late night overnight long back to the war to Greece early rain for Sunday salads on in the afternoon time mid sixties around Seventy says like ranging in the Sunday night thunder showers late overnight lows the soon and rain heading for our Monday\nAfternoon ... sixty hour by the ... with the weather channel used on the hour on to ask\nAnd awesome man is W.
