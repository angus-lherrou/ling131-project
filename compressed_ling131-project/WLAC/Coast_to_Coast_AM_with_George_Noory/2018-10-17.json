name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie or they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells you know he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThat there's going to be removed and the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they gonna era\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is they launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how\nYou know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a so called credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what can you really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of these is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift [laughter] she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod certainly could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes\nAnd then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said there are so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking\nDistance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will\nYou know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful life was on the Willoughby or it's just like really as kind of a stop at will abuse kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they both very similar and they're both\nAmong among my favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth in and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know the that's\nThe [laughter] ever [laughter] and then it just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the uh you hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling is very first breakthrough hit\nCalled patterns on crafts theater or he started that and you start in the fever and yet exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged to Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine of the things is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah for the\nNext day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas ... about some of the older type television programs check in with us next on coast to coast they I'm\nNever missed a detail Lewis show or a gift sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\nAt the end of the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spill person you know a sense of you thanks\nVery found out who they were in the the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery\nOr because everybody thought she was ugly and uh she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter about the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode or certainly wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally released years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas deal\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to half hour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated\nSo it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years or in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course horrible\nHorrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nLike a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very escapist\nWell then maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had one job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really light that my second question would be about\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what that what else do you know about it and that's cool well uh\nWhen his career started that I think a little bit ah he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from a a word come once in a little cemetery called uh inter lake and write on a lake in much the love that area and it's white or when they first got married they had their honeymoon there\nAh on ah the lake or a ...\nA her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they live there and they always went back there on a summer you are\nRight and relax and uh but uh a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion for ah people\nHey no an area like a street or whatever might be a store I mean which kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help him out\nYeah absolutely ... every ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in the ... yeah he he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses and I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent he every letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters written signed and everything [noise] um he\nTook that time to do that and it's really amazing that that you can't really find a
