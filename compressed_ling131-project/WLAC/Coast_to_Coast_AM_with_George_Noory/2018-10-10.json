world after they pass on to the body the person taking them\nDo you get just a disaster gotta be careful\nGoogle Plus I don't use it but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet Lauren Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus from so hopeless\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform as it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um this is going to be missed\n... if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his\nBook so there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on\nBut prizes everything with social media scale is everything at Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top of they currently found out about this a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why it's her petition\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient a kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would have been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus\nWhich operates for their G. sweep the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using us that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place\nThat's a time at ... at the end at the time well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke who do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a wall up yeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there or you know kind of messages to the troops the kind of ... tried to cheer them up\nUh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nUp there that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly you know ... you can live off the ball and you and you can really uh fall flat later on whether or not snapshot steps that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now that they're not they're certainly not the uh uh the star of of the moment like there were some time ago\nPoint thanks Lauren

work in into upside down thinking\nMarch ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues would you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition telecast psycho couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat the pre sentiment pre cognition studies have done it to reverse order where the body is measured before the picture is shown and no one knows what picture will be shown because it's randomly generated by a computer\nSo the computer will vary that picture shown sometimes it's a violent picture sometimes at the picture of a peaceful landscape like a mountain or river want something that wouldn't arouse the body\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect I think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they show videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true\nAnd I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that\nMatter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in people people have that ability growing up\nThat's right George ... those are perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around event\nThat we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a concentrate basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for

incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\n[noise] well I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked\nInto it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator work actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller then and\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real um but a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies\nWere run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that town totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where

music all your favorite thing\nTo lead you to see him Nashville\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up charts this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond Lucy nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't see with our eyes I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest their resuscitated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one the real scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma\nIn many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nWas later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWho is look at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit when what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes in our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us\nAt our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientists you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid in Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist and I materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the\n... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing your Larry to you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about psych medications explains psychiatric medications\nMedications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nFact chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical leave the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nThe going back to ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in fact the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia\nThe brain does affect the consciousness the mines does things that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and that type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if\nAnd then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue that says well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up a very strong\nStation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark reincarnation well I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on\nAnd the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drumming let's say\nExactly what's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm

not American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet a but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that the system with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being researched widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something where the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has Ariz outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world on an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though there are localized in

L. A. C. [noise]\n\nWell\nThis is that time of year where we talk about those stories and we're going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collected Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the wrong with the young known the unexplained and the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me look good for to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful woman when I was\nAt that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is a famine and feel often when I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed and her her guide and very regal looking very on you know she's a big prize\nFor her and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just\nSay the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft\nAnd um so basically she did you know she really changed the whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right Fidel type of these and then it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ...\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said disability what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just\nNever really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought the girls in the same um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I mean it was normal I did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her I should say out here in the holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father shipped normal um but\nShe didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but saying the metaphysical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in there and he finally told me that he is you know what Marlene ... from my family\nFor many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll than of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding you reading to them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew\nHer um but my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people who I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so\nIt's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history and who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and ah I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and that she was maybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a ...\nTo see 'em and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique about what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nNow you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter I'm a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um [noise] you know he started to cable program and during that cable program he had to do\nIt on something so he chose you know doing on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individuals\nThat you know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get a you go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee why look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then we're just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigation is\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain in their lives\nMore than you conclude about what this may be or make a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think there\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case\nOf a woman who was living by herself with the door to door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs on you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\nUm doesn't mean that you're going to have a spirit that a hundred percent you know wonderful and nice\nOh I see it as much as you probably try to try to stay focused ... you know you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realized that you know our own you know mortality right so it can you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions money it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest case you've come across strangers\nStrangers case [noise] okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time he would never tell me where we were going on because it's to keep me honest right so I'm not\nGoogling line that information eager for\n'em to one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case at ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us in our\nYou know ha ha ha so yeah exactly um yeah I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I say oh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home it's just you know little ranch style house and\nWe we get there and if that's you know meant to guys there wanted they just look really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like run I think his name was moose and the big big guy covered in tattoos me just try to you know\nJust overwhelming right to sit there and so why is just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is shattered glass table from busted and\nIt just looked like someone to the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've\nMy phone's been ringing with all heroes on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all the things they kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes and thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry and very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to use them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right\nI'm elites Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any rags me down on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself\nAnd I said well you know I really\nDon't feel it's a little girl and you gotta be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want you here and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast\nDream along

more goes chronicles is is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation was daytime investigations jumped him call me up and asked me to check out his house so I gather in Marin now but we went to his house and the places that massive would look like it's been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kinda got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of ... separated from the other one and the other one talked marina as we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted more rain and come back alone but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling

a sound equipment or something like that and I was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies when
