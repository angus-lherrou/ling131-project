with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because you can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population and increasingly allowed them to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to charge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates filled out it's because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record what it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution\nSo I think he's apt to sort of bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to get some of the

know just sweating under a coffee table shaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid when the skipper were yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island\nI Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether you know and we were watching that blew my dad and I think what a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nCar and I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies to kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature feature I'd be next to him are hiding behind the recliner sometime\nThis move Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to take that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I

years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that baby baby a twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year old and and beyond are probably a much much more likely to enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going to be\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and do well on whether they go to movies or\nNot I I Can't remember the last movie I went to I mean I\nI look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it uh but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual really I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience but a lot of times\nThat you ... ... that's your ... your business so I I I'm\nI'm

I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes and yes you'll remote viewing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear misses viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your book you're my gosh\nWell thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and socialists or apology you've just been elected a vice president of the psychological shows you usually get into that but this will lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and the ... the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered\nTo books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book called the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nAstronaut regard and I didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about\nMm Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we're looking at trance personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of our experience\nThat transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough the understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is really only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually strollers brewery what she'll remember I remember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe ... still college which beer you know I don't know I haven't really ... death toll Hampshire\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences of all the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste a son that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then more and more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention you know the fact that the intentions of\nVery important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going\nForward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter]\nI think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the ... are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House\nAnd her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more and his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nWhat's important too is a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about this\nStory reincarnation of on the little child but was born with

Seventy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of\nA personal worth their ... their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem\nYou'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people so I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI I think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know Edgar Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with\nHim for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean\nIt was like a needle in a haystack and so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he\nFelt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death [noise] if you are like quarter law and she knew this was challenged debts was challenged could you prove that there's life after death\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show your love Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge in a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences we ... put it right there and then you get into this question of what one shift\nPeople's mind about that question and\nIs it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think\nAgain we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shaped our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called in attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's\nA lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness live just outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is\nSomething that has intelligence it is self correcting\nIt is reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an lp phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it\nDoesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nIt keeps coming ... exactly you will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all of this\n[noise] I think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot near Hartford\nWas her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that

wife after this\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that give them a sense of that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know beyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future uh people\nYou know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location the whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that the majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education\nSo this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences\nCan lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHound them were younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of uh there's certainly a lot of fascination with\nI you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see\nSo what's that about you know is that about just something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening what's\nSome calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either Giovanni\nWould go on your roof me when the war\nYeah and that's been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth\nMore a wonder and and and and after you into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine that are just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forest or above the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are very very uh very rich culture of a ... and and also a you know being able to travelling through you know in three dimensional and\nAnd uh and explore the potential of the mind through um through an ancient practices\nAnd so it's been instilled in me over time uh the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travels I was traveling Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called luck than on negative or roughly childhood or the black a jungle and the this this black jungle is just is an illusion jungle it's\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely explored still\nStill rich with with a with a with undiscovered I'm\nA lord knows what's out there but when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour in my meditation I felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle\n... it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered that beautiful because\nI was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling you or or or trying to pull me into it\nSomehow and I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there ... and the more we explore the more we'll find like you said if we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it as opposed to just\nShrug it off and not believing something is there what did you think about ...\nAm so grateful for that comment on the question I appreciate ir supportive words and I think that one of the reasons that many traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is\nThat a spiritual leader or you know the mistake who's been on the path before so they can help guide the process because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered\nAnd that have the capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey work\nOr they can help calibrate that and you know keep you grounded in the experience\nBut it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von who uh is no longer in this plane of experience but she let this meditation where she took our identity into a bubble\nAnd the bubble left to the body and went off somewhere and I know that I got pretty lost in that moment and I thought\nIf I didn't have the kind of grounding that I had I could see how some people could be very frightened or destabilized by that\nAnd in fact there was a woman I'm Willoughby Britain who is a
