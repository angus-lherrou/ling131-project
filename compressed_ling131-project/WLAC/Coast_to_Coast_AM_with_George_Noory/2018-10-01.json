missing for one one guy coming back Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great to have you back\nIn Georgia I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities or some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family are people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and\nThere's a lot of parallels to my life a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put in the book just recently probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know have these people are really really good people these are the drags fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers but people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out\nTo you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah I've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got stuck well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nSee who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative back right on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd a sort of how it all started and I filed a series of the freedom of Information Act of course the confessional Park Service they have the largest contingent\nA federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any listened

yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\n[noise] so this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David flight is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds\nThey're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent\nAnd listeners to get on and\nEvery time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads the only site that has me is that can ... missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know\nIf somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use aero Flynn on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there is a case from eighty six\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen all these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address and want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child with a child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and\nAnd go to sleep and I said how many how many parents and your that your kid would run up hill nobody raised around I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise] but I have all these examples where the heights been achieved by these little ...\nWhere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on a you know you've got to move we\nTalked about a two year old boy that they just traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was found face down and you know the next morning unbelievably of why we found that got years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and this is Martha couldn't believe we found him and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on the bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he didn't have to go watch six miles per hour\nBut kids are going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and blocked him there\n[noise] [noise] well and and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know I sure as probable somebody put them in the car and drove down there\nBut when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody sonic cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make a difference in that time ...\nOr in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one\nThat happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona ready to take a break now when we come back this one has really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy\nI Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David polite is going to take a break the ...

case of Carol Turner this is pretty creepy what did you learn\nSo for people who don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service it's their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's an ... a location called Oregon or gee a an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nOn February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old name Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called her\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah some pretty documents on that case I got the documents in my hand that I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they said uh we don't have any\nI said have you heard of that case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles and all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money\nShe love the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions was smart February second she went to the park visitors center spoke\nTo a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved her car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling\nAnd found carols car parked in s this Kenyan picnic site with a note tape inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February third please contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly no I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he had the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advises them that he has a missing hiker and starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined care was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs\nMonth an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search every three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that are the care would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press it's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery\nMarch seven one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service put a team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines a search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says\nOne

E. airship and this was originally taken by our military [noise]\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for a person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minutes to the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to you over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the blunt [noise]\nWell the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them at ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen Fort function cause Moffett Field against dating that in LA had crashed\nIn the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast or the navy response to Daly city and they find the airship on the ground with one bomb missing the\nGone to was in near perfect condition both motors on a ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of her life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone\nThere was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks the radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor function and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a postcard shipped to solve the blimp dip and dropped to ... on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds\nThey said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean the\nCrew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break in the background to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nEnded up break with journey wheel in the sky\nTo find them more of us just log on to go to ... am done\n\n\n\nAnd my father down there in ... and you say no cars and they now you said from the ... the parents [noise] Hi this\nIs Brittany ... owner and I didn't go in and this is why we always is a regional quality part and written here to the manufacturing specifications which is also why were started by by more on and they have been any sat in the mid town it your being sent in ordinary\nMaking gay raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring the men of this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever we age list male Macs a patent pending formula was an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases and muscle size and twice\nThe reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric\nOxide he shot by the ensure be aware many insurance companies shops are working to stay the insurance company money in there for you that mandate or junkyard parts in other words they're working for the insurance company to save them money prices\nWe accept all in saying that we work for you and you do have the right to choose where to get your hair she's the one hand we're seeing in your family say\n\nThat again in ...

L. A. C. dot com and click that little T [noise]\n\n\nBefore the break we're talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast of California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone Dave pick up the story from there [noise] so\nThe navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it dropped one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch a lick that they were watching on the water there\nWere lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nOf the Golden Gate to a location called the half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that\nAre very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area and nothing immediately half half moon bay so it's one area that have just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and ah and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak right because the the area of the water that was searched up there with search so\nThoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so all these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I noticed that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works uh in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle ... that had happened and he went to a base in\nAt the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched out of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point at one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they uh they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulls me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it any asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomenon at the ranch and I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nThe idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's\nThis person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so you know he\nHe has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think it's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call I think so um\nSo ... you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a disappearance so I could sing my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but as I said before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood\nBecause they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre and isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the most right in the middle of the ... reservation to use a control and property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people have drowned there and uh\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure uh December twenty

direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around ab ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the the people that I haven't been walking with the

persons a mystery\nYou have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story my last book one right before the ... about a story of a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing that came up on this giant piece a pink granite in Texas it's a state park [noise]\nAnd he said that as he ran up to the top of the granite it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside this Boulder he guest made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount\nAnd that isn't the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories out of Iceland that they will move road when they're building it
