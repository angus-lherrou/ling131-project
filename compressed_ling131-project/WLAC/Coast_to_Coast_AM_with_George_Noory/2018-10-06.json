married and have her children that that seriously that's all she really ever wanted\nHow important Marion or the dreams for communicating with a dead\nIs very important if somebody died in there was unfinished business\nBecause if when that person comes in your dream you can ask them ... or apologize to them or what it what happened why did we break apart anything like that the same thing somebody that died violently or was murdered\nIf I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over I Can't give the any law enforcement agencies any information\nBut if that person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend that's what the heck happened and you'd be surprised how much information you can get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo I don't know or or if they do they're not passing them on exactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show maryann in want to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were\nA little girl correct a well were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth spirits the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and\nSo you know I was grandma special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never skill to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it but\nHe was and he was talking to me and I you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the goes turn it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared that it'd be ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person because I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did the did you always happen like that\n[noise] [noise] no I think that the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time\nAnd by so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly\nLong if I'm doing a place like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there\nAnd I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough and it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to\nHear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that oh you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five\nThirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face and\nAnd I wouldn't houses if I thought a ghost keeps telling me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that act skip the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it's still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this is look at me and go ...

double\n[noise] I think that and I keep seeing him maybe three times or the ones that were so evil that they had come from the\nBlack cool yeah and I if I ever\nRun across that situation now I really try to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTo trying to get rid of the level or the demon or whatever it might be exactly\nThat's exactly right and there are people that say they're deem and I'll just like they can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I Would end up bleeding somewhere I Would get scratched or\nOr looked like I was bit GE or something and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that's again something that I Will refer to in order to increase\nLoves

did they did it on there and they knew better right of course\nThey will love would call me up to date because she always got her her scripts you know like three days before the new one right\nWhen she was good with you she liked to you\nYeah and she would call me up and she'd go you should see what they're having me\nDo I do know but yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour\nThey seem to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made a\nNew to Dr James van Prague nuts\nWell no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming when do you mean talking about why not it looks all were found spirits like the ones that oh [noise]\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and uh but he really Clinton helped set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios are doing a I'm\nA something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a miss barber stand with standing there\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria ... from the ... valley\nYeah exactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was there a pound and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that\nIn James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going\nI literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went into the light\nAnd she said huh\nAnd I said have you talked to other people live people she said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go the Jewish she'll walk and talk about it in she went in the light so\nI Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nDo you remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady kept by little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possess during tricked or something some strange way it changed your personality\nOr so I Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when he goes was ... was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house\nAnd sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person\nDoesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and that and I helped you know\nWork on that and I looked at him and I sort of squinting my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked at me I says why\nDid you put flies in the attic what could that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill I said\nFlies have nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold\nPerson I says why did you even do that it it's like people just do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of the I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of

give\nUs our go ahead of though about anybody you'd have to put on them [noise] ah but\nWe're not going to be like you said are back in the day when I was maybe Seventeen Eighteen before cable you know I was watching the losers shows like watching them a lot\nOf these Christian pastor who were sitting on the log around trying to think about it is these Christian ... used to like go to sleep at

like it could be credible I've never experienced it but that doesn't mean I Can't or hasn't happened\nBut the everyday people that I run into now don't have that ability or that resource to go to so it's I can only do the best they can\nYour generally do every time I talk to you beat Maria and I've never seen you down or your energy level low you've got to be able to ban all these things off you like crazy I bet\nWell I I think I can but I think that he has just been what I I made a good shells around myself the older I've gotten it's gotten thicker and I'm more you know confident and and

within an hour as\nFriends come over that person I work with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up he I dislocated\nIt I thought well now a as well you might as well get up and move around on it all\nAs otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh\nLike I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with maple little while and uh they all want to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening\nAnd a wintertime and we got up there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me I didn't understand\nWhy at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a at the water right and tied up on a rope or something\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean that was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that often enough and the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and um yeah they're to me it then you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried to push and couldn't get no no moment um\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on earth is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sent thing when I was there you know in those places\nEarlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh our father who art\nIn heaven hallowed be thy name leaves are doing that under my in my mind\nOver and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this new that I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him and I says yeah and she goes we better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up\nAnd pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that that's where your car pulled out of the bomb
