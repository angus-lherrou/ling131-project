welcome to the program\nBum bum bum bum bum [laughter] not all opera singer and you know if the deep voice you know if you've been\nWell I've been a really busy I've been so busy that I kind of dropped out for about a my last hope bulletins\nCame the eleventh of August and just today I unloaded a forty thousand word Thirteen article a wave I called the nominee to catch up on everything and it's just so much going on also I was traveling I was traveling into the deep red state of Arkansas uh-huh\nTo do the arc land has\nConvention and also on the way of ... I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always it always strikes\nMe as somebody who is a free\nWing neither blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems\nTo be polarizing the country as your report said worse than ever before um but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news and just talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state\nAnd ah it's ah it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a a this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned\nAnd uh I was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a\nThat was basically is happening is a\nA level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy their play right now\nOne is a is you're honest and just recently come in to tourists\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn\nLong story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the story in fine which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations whereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn\nSaturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's\nDigital and so you have a long story short it's it it favors the establishment more than it favors\nThose who are resisting the establishment um because Iran has in Taurus as in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable flying\nThat it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nDestabilize established banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of time in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms has slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth is almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so\nThe the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and it is a\nIt is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from getting the house by\nGetting the sent back but for what\nIt's not really define itself is what we know what the resistance is against right here at all every day here because I live in the very heart of it at your uh but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if it if you follow this pattern with much more energy to it then it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said\nClinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland\n... five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it'll happen because\nIf you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except you're on a tear them down and then\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news that it is really quite and this classic um Iran is\nConfusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sign it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior\nThat's going to come and save you from your cells and you know I have been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really a hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world [noise]\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around of just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if if red voters threat American voters go to the polls early\nEspecially in a lot of the areas which will be in the early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecasts for this year she how close he's coming and uh also march twenty third you live in Everett, Washington\nJust circled on dates for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to [noise]\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download to bring home advisor\n\n[noise] well thirty AM and you're listening to coast it goes [noise]\n\n\nBy the way I view swimming visor dot com for some home projects and they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different ... names and the other all qualified pick the one you want a\nSuperb workers way John ... with us as we talk about process the predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\n[noise] well uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking have been my my eighth prophecy what I did is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nI'd definitely things have intensified that way the second prophecy was a year on us in the last chance sect style that looked at a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but that petered out by\nMay ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also\nThe third prophecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nAh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted astrological we both had the danger if not if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise] so\nUh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before\nThat the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at ... eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so\nWith that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that if he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president\n... what's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking\nNotes taking and it's like I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise]\nUm every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists uh\nThey're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six years he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states\nI see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote rice said\n... million strong\nYou know I said ten months before Trump was elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats just switching back and forth and in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just\nMore and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\nAnd it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this\nCrisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world is just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually\nThink of a way to get out of the margins it's kind of have to get much worse and frankly astrology a saying that they're not going to see it a tide shift until the middle of the next decade or we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen it was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all this fighting about that [noise] is it I said very clearly\nAll the fighting about that [noise] is it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send the Kavanaugh would be picked\nThat um [noise] I I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look a cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I I don't think so why a lot\nBut I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty these these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two\nMajor corporate establishment will to power [noise]\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging Miami which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's a sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty with the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states\nAnd so that's that's\nMy call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more\nRecently we're on the History Channel really you know the so called the last hope and the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities Lee ...\nHee huh it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show\nUh I mean to have to kind of talk about something that happened uh for my own sake of credibility I I'm Sorry I even have to say it

help the British Petroleum retain a Iranian oil\nAnd then they helped train the ... which is as worse as bad as the stop all in Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic\nThat's why they threw the shah revenge really\nYes and so so this bad karma here and we're basically blindsided to our side uh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here ...\nNow so so we have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\nNot just the city in Syria\nSyria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started is um arid organ of ... or ... the president of turkey and ladder improved and\nGot together and made a pact to not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area owns horrible what what's good about\nIs it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the real red staged and film the White Helmets who are basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them in some gassing attack that's the story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still ... started as a once again another false flag the Syrian regime had chemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused ah [noise]\nYou know we have thirty Russian warships says this time around\nAnd and the mere equal number of American ships crowding eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious and and so\nAnd then one thing can lead to another in to a\nNuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen um\nThe soles of October twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen um the astrology kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in a short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War\nWhen the Russians announce that we achieved a parity in March first this year they delayed they're putting delayed his address to the nation Russia and any so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves a very very destabilizing move a hardly reported so the Russians declaring march first that pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now\nMade a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense the same time Trump as another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP\nEvery year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed it was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed we're doing the same thing\nSo uh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of ... through the spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and ... who was considered the Swedish Edgar Casey Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and trance and he he would say things like ah you'll see the one side of the Cold War with China and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union and police in this economic sense [noise]\nThat's true uh with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say from my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with than the country I grew up with\nNo that's that's true in in ... and the last minutes we before the break them will take final calls next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide that this this intrigues me why are you doing this\n[noise] well I've been watching ... two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique rebellious but really an unorthodox way of\nKind of dragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate in in my travels it's kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach\nTo really meet with people when people break break bread they they they it it's a connection that is what I was saying earlier in the show how\nWe can we need to talk to each other rather than polarized both\nHave a big bank would have all the red Republicans with blue Democrats break bread together like Anthony would do so anyway I watched the show I also saw this brilliant man his doing what a lot of potentially brilliant people and he's also seeker\nA spiritual speaker in a true sense because he wasn't buying into\nEasy a rationales of belief he was really questioning things on course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well and it wasn't a surprise to me that he committed suicide because I feel\nAs much as I Love him I also had a similar things issues in my own\nLife really let's talk about that John when we come back in a moment we'll take your calls have you on hold just hang right there\nNever was a detail in the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... am dot com [noise]\nApple groomed us on dot

deals reborn everyone how's it\nGoing to do their thing Donald ... says\nNon am twelve thirty Jay Z are at the river [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back coast to coast George story with you John ... with us we'll get to your calls in just a second I just have one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about\nThe lead celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicides a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because my experience with suicide\nWas a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide most\nPeople encounter um basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in but in the suicide that\nHappened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane Lee going to do\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and remained and so this is one of my most intimate\nAutobiographical tales of the whole other dimensions of my life for all these years I've never known this way I was\nI was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time\nAnd when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and I was having a very bad day and so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me says I could just keep walking\nOr beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks and I was going to do it because suddenly ice had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible unclear I have to see how\nThey're really one there really\nThere are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond where it's really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um\nIt was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff if I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences over taking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat\nUp against and I said okay before I found myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge and so I sat there this going inside and feeling\nIt at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass\nOr I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing the you know not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeve and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where I realized the sky the earth\nTree existence love me existence sees everything that's created out of it\nAs a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant [noise] and I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death\nInsignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an ... it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about what's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... has a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my\nThese books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this\nBook I'm In a cashiers line and there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before\nShe's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's a people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so intimate and beautiful\nAnd that's when I realized wow I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe or in\nFairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his sins and all that it's really pretty practice and\nAnd and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one and I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much um\nHangst and polarity\nMy inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ...\nPoint this center of silence and peace in the cycling of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that is what I can share with all of you in meditation science of self\nObservation is is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and\nMore and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nSo huge on let's take some phone calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while it's hard to follow your sharing your experience on that but my question John yes\nFor a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world how can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are not enough for dead\nOn a fact dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise] and\nUh so my answer to that is\nIf any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting to [noise] um\nI Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed jury you can be a Buddha and the market place but not of the marketplace of the world and that was what my teacher taught oh show\nAnd that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time
