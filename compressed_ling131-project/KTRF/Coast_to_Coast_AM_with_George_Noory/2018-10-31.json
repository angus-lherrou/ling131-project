height of the economic economic boom of the sixties and nineties and their mood is bright across all income groups not just among the rich what's going on let's check in with Catherine Austin sits\nCatherine why this year for a about the economy\nWell we've repatriated economic capital we have very strong fiscal stimulus and you know that means a lot of money is coming back including George the fact that\nMuch manufacturing that we had a broad is now can be brought back and that's in part thanks for robotics and technology so you it has to break up right now in the global economy and\nAnd the question is if the rest of the world doesn't join us there you know well that drag us down but for now\nPatterson perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\nYes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use digital radio is to scan the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can\nLiterally break it in such a way so that does that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station\nWhen the signal comes and clear it just continually sweeps and again that that's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick sparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with what is called springs box which is trying to exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex he'll eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing\nSomething that had been being done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John the who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that use of a scene stone is the same as using our radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic the vice some material device\nWhere we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be dealing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers that have more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers would probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home\n[laughter] that's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with the Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something in the U.S with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend typical them as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help that\nThe goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked or there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal of becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it\nIt there's chaos as soon as the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep get one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dot sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories\nBut if you look at the actual Jewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways\nAnd means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual ... it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal um itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful tell my story where\nA rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal in the sense to them well what can I Do care to speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right right so\nWe can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nHere what about the Sherman says well you know in native ah American tradition and other types of was a direct cultures the showman also seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the ... would also use utilize sound and\nLight off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to introduce the states have consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet but\nThey were using technologies to be able to create the state of consciousness\nIn the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in ... we want to invest in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think of something that we have long been excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ...\nSure experiences knit\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was it you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists rational\nAnd it's not that they were the bunk and because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that they are to be the truth this is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his\nHe believed that it could be possible and I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves\nInto those either Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] maybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you sort of you to move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most ...\nTried to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in the moment to talk more with Peter a beeper goal his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book you if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural she'll stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour will even take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCaused insiders who knew version of the coast to coast am Abu no available for iPhone and know Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded to the [noise]\nSomething about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we\nAre in charge of our own salvation\nWhere we want to be right in front of our experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it and so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right\nJust another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool and I\nCould we put you Peter in that category\n[noise] myself yeah well\nI definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we\nOnce used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual aren't are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working\nWith these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular are you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's\nWe live in a world where we still feel that\nThese questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when a ... or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that\nIs underneath it scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's southern effect and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there\nAbout how we can think about technologies in ways that that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't know on the radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and should Peter ... voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he taught there he's out there and you of course who never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or but my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to is the right kind of receiver\n[noise] well it's fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual as a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology and people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph\n[laughter] they really\nBelieve that there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology tell me why\n[noise] [noise] well I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah\nIt does the some of the the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually\nIn thirty four called the blue television company and they actually they this is how they advertised on TV this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird but to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that\nWe once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate Chaffetz VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those ghosts I so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically\nIs is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we talk about technology that if we're not believers and even if we're just using it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight as but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk go radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was a case in this beautiful piece of wouldn't furniture and ... co written across it uh it ... it was it was a piece of art\nIn the same we have TVs in the in the cereals that they started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be center pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited\nAll place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about is about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states are in chanting steak it when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence uploading our consciousness to computers\nThere's a you know movement of what's called trans humanism and hosts humanists who believe that we will become so merged with technology\nThat that we will become the new spirit world\nThat it's going to be our consciousness inhabiting this electronic digital realm I'm so I'm I'm more convinced that that it's going to be a that we ourselves will become transcended via this technology\nLooking for a cause false claims I'm only a princess

and him a name you know so\nSo that that's the whole point let's we we we shouldn't name or asking prayer the name of our angel [noise] uh I I Know several friends very spiritual religious friends who knows or guardian angels name a gentleman and like one one friend he was at a charismatic ... conference one time\nAnd like some lady didn't even know have them on the shoulder and said you know you're a guardian angels name is and and and she said you know she said that it was a ... era your guardian angels name as severe\nAnd meditate it or that he said you know she's she's right\nHe never he never saw this lady again\nThat's Ron I'm going to ask you a question but I got to know how old are you because the question does mean anything if if you're not old enough\nWould hold on I'm sixty two okay do you remember the Catholic bishops Fulton Sheen\nOh absolutely oh wait a life worth living he has to have is angel that's right on the board and then he'd go off can go to you know a different you know with a view of the camera and then he said there's by the poor would suddenly you know\nFrom where it would be raised or they'd write something down and the and it was a highly rated show with one or two cameras that was\nNot it not Milton borrow awful number one status attorneys called Milky was was number one before fish of shame came on and he he had he had the highest rated show in the fifties\nCould you imagine people would gather around and I think it was on Sunday was isn't it\n[noise] I I of course that's what I was born so I only see you know his shows are on replay now Anita ... and so I mean it kind of makes sense that would be on Sunday but you know I I don't know but yeah people together and he had these penetrating eyes\nThat yes we're kind of what he could he was like Padre to you [laughter] guys\nTo look ... look for in a TV screen to look into your soul and talk to you\nAnd and you really believe the angels were there Ron thanks for that Peter you're probably too young to remember that\nNo but I Love that it all happened um that these miracles happened over the television\nYeah that's true [laughter] that's absolutely true technology at its best\nTrying somebody's going to come up with something somewhere I think don't you\nI mean some you know we can only become more advanced and it's going to be interesting to see if one day these different parts of our lives can really merge in some way and maybe it's technology that's going to make that possible\nLet's go to Carolyn are hemmed in Connecticut now Hi Carol thanks for calling\nHigh on maybe I haven't had anyone tell you about a strange and sent them than what they a CD player or I go ahead please\nWhat happened was I was writing a one block past where my son used to work and and die in between the songs on the CD it's about five seven seconds and uh all of a sudden I hear a young boy say\nSeven second and uh all of a sudden I hear a young boy hey don't drive that way\nNo one no one has any access to my CDs my anything and I'm looking around on a thing where it's coming from is coming from the thing it never happened again I played it over and over again never done any other CDs\nDon't drive that all of the advice of the slaves or I bet it said you didn't had Carol\n[noise] well I don't know if that if you just don't don't cut through past where I'm I'm all we where I worked\nOr maybe a trained me a car was like that or yeah or or maybe an accent but I just drove the exact same Lincoln to\nWhat you were what were you aware of it were you thinking a little bit more\nI wasn't thinking about it [laughter]\nI got you know in between absolutely quiet you know you know a pretty new CD and I played it over and over again and I just thought you you'd want to know about a CD incident where you say there's radio you know am FM or whatever we think this is just said hey\nAll right it's pretty ... pretty soon it'll be popping up on podcasts Peter\nTouch right exactly what those to the whole range of electronic Bush phenomenon I mean the earliest researchers weren't using radios they were using white noise they were using just a quiet room with a microphone it was it wasn't so much about that that the vice itself it was the fact that it was a electronic\nMedia it was making this possible some record about media whether it was a tape\n'em or I next case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some people do not react\nTo that little angel city now their shoulder whispering in their ear telling them don't do this or no here go straight to stop you have to be able to\nDetermine when to do these things right mhm because if you don't you could miss a great opportunity or you could get killed or something like that and put out\nAbsolutely and I do you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experienced but maybe you know maybe sometimes we project\nThese things from within ourselves on to the media you know maybe it stopped the spirit world communicating chew off with the with the um radio or what the tape player maybe it's our own unconscious\nOur own spirits that are trying to communicate something to watch that we need to hear\nWhen you started writing the book strange frequencies was an easy or difficult for you to get it started\n[noise] well part of the problem for me was is that each one of the subjects that I took up there's been you know decades of research and books about them so what I Would have to try to figure out a way to do is take all of this material and and turned it into what I think I Hope is interesting stories about\nThese these specific thing I mean the history of there's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography but I wanted to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and doing show take up\nYou know some of the important background information but yes it ... it was difficult and I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand that but no matter how you want to approach the subjects whether you want approached the skeptic or as a full on believer or\nThe way that I like to approach them more as a journalist and a historian that\nPeople are wary when you bring up or it's like supernatural are caught they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or if you're coming at it from a\nFrom a way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I wanted to work with the subjects that all poses problems sometimes when I'm asking to interview somebody and they're a little bit mistrust sure my intentions might be\nWell in a lot of people Peter when they hear the word a cult think

supernatural at a moment are very special guest professor slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was a Hungarian born American illusion is than stumped performer noted for\nHis sensational escape actually first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S and that is Sherrie ... got a tour of Europe or he challenged police force has to keep him locked up\nSunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from skyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath inside a sealed milk Ken what the water in it Ninety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups\nCommissioned by London's daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour\nAnd another ... buried alive only just able to claw himself to the surface or merge you know the state of near break down\nNow ... suspected that these ... were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge are fake spiritual as he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her\nHe was not successful he told his wife bash that when he died they will try to communicate he will try to come back\nHarry Houdini died on October thirty first Halloween\nNineteen twenty six in Detroit Michigan on October\nThirty first Nineteen thirty six ten years later that the Knickerbocker hotel in Hollywood, California they conducted a say on ... to try to find didn't reach Harry Houdini\nWho do you have the substances that what happened\nYes yeah it was a\nParrot might have ... salt through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work during those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he invests it worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds\nOr since before Nineteen Thirteen they had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out\nIf one of them died that they would um\nUse this code contact\nEach other and so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget the code what are the you know I'm a medium tranche what happens\nIf aren't there Ford was a tramp medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which\nFrom arrived and she's like was he was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a post\n... he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep okay like like Casey\nAll righty goes into that ...\nRight he just goes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious\nBut he consciously doesn't really remember all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these than says in one of them he contacted Houdini some other\nAbout a year before this and then he starts having these stances and he starts getting the code now Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than\nA nine words spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says\nBack to him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side one word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but\nHoudini was sharper than that who he said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him [noise] so this was an ingenious code really at because it's take it's a ten it's like\nFifteen works well why why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody know what was going on\n[noise] well ah as you know Harry had to be first\nFirst had to escape\nRight here with us the sky apologist you had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane in Australia\nYes he was that's true I heard him so\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game\nAbout that so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy um I think he would have been I think\nHe would have had a movie um career you know mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nRush cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome and all these\nDifferent ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was\nGoing to do he was going to do it and do you think it was successful\n[noise] I I Know we're successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact\nDid come for professor Bess his wife\n... best was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed but you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some well I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy\nAnd she uh\nWhile he was alive and after he died\nWhile he was alive and after he died\nAnd so if you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way\nAnd then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was arrested in the stock market yes she\nLoses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like a girls on trees she just\nAnd I guess hearing left or a nice little sum\n[noise] yeah he liked her a part of the uh they paid double or ... or whatever for his\nInsurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money\nThe opposite of dollars which in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money that\nRight ... probably that's close to a million dollars [noise] um so\nThey got about that because they said it was an accident because it's got punched mhm and so\nIt was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court so she got a thousand\nSo she was rolling in do you know and then she they put it all in a market and she lost at all\nNow you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the Kurdish\n[noise] know Houdini had a three part show first part of a show with magic mhm second part was skipped college ... skates he would do in Cape\nThat was where the water or a Chinese water torture cell or the or they can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual life and he would have have this um confrontation with them ... often\nSelf like confrontation right [noise] well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during the third part you would go out to a palm reader if somebody uh [noise] uh that he considered fake and you go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be on them and he'd go in and you find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark\nOr some of the I found it I got you you know and\nThen they're probably attached to a string or something like that\nRight so ... and of course the the medium to adjust my ah where do you do that I didn't I have nothing to do that well they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician and a magician always have what you're going out\nThere's always a way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and that's something else he switched to the next one and you switch to the next one and\nAnd at work so you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in the states of course I'm I guarantee you get two or three keys in there you know and if that failed and he couldn't get the T that's would come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate tea in her mouth\nA and just put it into his mouth exactly uh-huh\nHe always had an out he always had a way out well it was actually the same thing for the spiritual\nSpirituals because he had an agent and she would go into town and she would find some hanging fruit you would find some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't\nFind what they're doing French couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later who had a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere puts a curse on him\n[noise] right so he did this with Marjorie Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nUm hold on for ... seconds

R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here\nWhich they never had the\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] I'm like you for that one\nYeah uh well they can they can just like me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving them money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar\nContest so they were coming out way ahead so anyway the uh\nThe Scientific American has the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory saying on says so they set this up with six\nOf these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send 'em rose Mac and ... that's the agents that easily center ahead what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a sauna he builds this box and he has um\nJames Collins build it for him and he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in our hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get at anything so who d'nese got to make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they ah do once they aren't in everything goes according to plan and ah they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box\nAnd if they push on the ... the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now ah and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack\nSo there's no way anyone could get out well in the first ... the bell rings so the second thing he brings in the box and he puts her in the box he is going to stop it\nRight and they put that and the second say on the bell rings a bell\nSo now he's got a picture and ... we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her how he's you know exposed her\nSo he's got this book he's going to put out so we have to expose her so she comes in\nUh everybody gets around the sands and of course Marjorie has a spirit guide and his name is Walter ... Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini\nAnd he says why do you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nThis is ... and this was the spirit saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit Walter puts a death occurs because inside the box is a rule or one of those ... rulers pulls up into three pieces\nYup is one of those old kind\nAnd it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini and a James Collins\nHow was the curse a professor and then Houdini ended up dying\nWell the ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year a that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place we're Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nAnd could die at any moment\nYeah and really really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right that they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets\nSick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor 'cause he doesn't\nHe doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened\nWhy he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he live Houdini he outlive all uh he lived until Seventy one oh wow okay or Ford\nLived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini a tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he doesn't and he's got these photos of Marjory legs under the table\nAnd then he had some drawings made her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo\nIs not anything like that drawing oh trickery by Houdini\nSo Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one a expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with ...\nThe number one a expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with Don injure and then he worked with ... and she makes a statement and there's a a a bombshell in in the interview crafting\nAnd he gives this quote buy gifts and it says when we're all magicians realize that Houdini was often just honest as the mediums he purported to expose wow\nThat's pretty heavy that is heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em ... James Collins in there and that ah [noise] the rose Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three parts show\nCan you imagine what Houdini would have done professor if they had television in those days\nA boy you would have been you Michelle\nKyrie or brings up another a subject you know a set on San says and you wonder why people don't put a thing on TV really [noise] well I was involved in a\nWhile they have some dark and it's so much you won't see anything\nRight well we'll talk about that a little later because these say on for the ones I'm Talking about happened in broad daylight\nWell really aren't there for fans was about a new broad daylight when he had the Houdini fan [noise] um\nAnd friends might just see\nThis [noise] ...

consumers have been this confident only twice before at the height of the economic the economic boom of the sixties nineties and their mood is bright across all income groups not just among the rich what's going on let's check in with Catherine Austin sits\nCatherine why this year for a about the economy\nWell we've repatriated capital we have very strong fiscal stimulus\nAnd you know that means a lot of money is coming back including George attack that\nMuch manufacturing that we are than abroad is now can be brought back and that's in part thanks for robotics and technology so the U.S has the right spot right now in the global economy and the\nAnd the question is if the rest of the world doesn't join us there you know that tracked back down but for now\n[noise] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radios to scan the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figure it out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that's scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station\nWhen the signal comes in clear it just continually sweeps and again that that's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and others found sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick sparse moments as its scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is trying to exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex\nSo eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but then when he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John the who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that use of a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings have been attempting to deal with some media mystic the vice some material device\nWhere we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual\nHacker where we're really trying to interact with our technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know it's really the hackers\nThat have more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers would probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something in the U.S with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal them as it's called particularly the column of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a whole rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal of becomes it goes you know it it\nAnd eventually the goal and become ...\n... it goes you know it it it it\nIt there's chaos ensues the rabbi could no longer control it and either has to destroy it or you have to put it to sleep it one of the stories that goal ... grows so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder\nAnd race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbled into dot sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... mysticism mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways\nAnd means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual accurate man it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal um itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful tell my story where\nA rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal him and he said to them well what can I Do care to speak and they say well no I Can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretend to rush to the throne as it were\nHere what about the ... says well you know Native American tradition and other types of was a ... cultures the showman also seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to introduce the state of consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging spiritualism which spirit cabinet tend to different ways in which\nPeople were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state of consciousness in the audience said so I don't think it's necessarily well we we don't\nGo to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in ... we watch what is in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we have long been excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... that\nSure experience isn't it\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it wasn't you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists to rationalize\nAnd it's not that they were the funky ... because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want it there to be the truth is truth Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium\nWho could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother\nBut he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his but she believed that it could be possible and I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves into\nThose Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you said he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] maybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes founded that people were using these things but if you should have a you know move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most\nQuickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in the moment to talk more with Peter a beep or golf his book strange frequencies we got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nTo the super natural stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour we'll leave and take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCoast insiders who you version of it goes to ... am happy no available Rawhide bone and know Android ... was ... on demand anywhere any time going to go to ... dot com and downloaded to the\nSomething about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we\nAre in charge of our own salvation\nWhere we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with the spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it and so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right\nIt's just another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves\nBetween right right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool and I\nCould we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that\nUm I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it or is\nIt you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we\nOnce used to think that a bit a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual aren't are often\nConsidered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working\nWith these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular are you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I want to re solder a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world [noise] but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect hate plays\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against\nAnd yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath it scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's\nIt's underneath it and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can fix about technologies in ways that that the science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said Peter I hear voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course who never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or what my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to do the right time to receiver\nWell fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual ism was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology and people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph\n[laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology tell me why\n[noise] [noise] well I mean the TV itself has kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah if the some of the the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four\nCalled the blue television company and they actually they this is how they advertise their television\nAnnie and they actually\nThey this is how they advertise their television this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we used to watch you HFCs VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those ghosts right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically\nIs is filled to the brim right with these supernatural and I called metaphors and I think that that's really important I think it even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just using it we still use these\nThis language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk all radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wood furniture and had silicone written across it\nUh it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same we have TVs in in the stereotypes that they started coming out with\nIts right these are meant to be center pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about is about technology is it I really believe that these ambiguous\nStates are in ... states that when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of\nArtificial intelligence upload in our consciousness to computers there's a movement of what's called trans humanism and\nHosts humanists who believe that we will become so merged with technology that that we will become the new spirit world\nThat it's going to be our consciousness inhabiting this electronic digital realm I'm so I'm I'm more convinced that that it's going to be a that we ourselves will become transcended via this technology",
