York well what do they do anyway\n[noise] well they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries their goals from the website\nWhere that they were run it to a race ambition reduce climate change it accelerate climate action or some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister of England spoke bond key move from the United nations [noise] I'm actor Hugh Jackman\nUh-huh who the man the Wolverine spoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached and three hundred and news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change a light\nBulbs they can save polar bears ... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe\nAnd George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are no I've never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nIsrael pollution to fix that is\nCorrect but I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down [noise]\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people can fleeting without coal real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment [noise] things like carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for a day I'm\nThe mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a odorless harmless invisible gas and what I speak to groups I like to say to them what the cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that\nThere are so many proponents for man made climate change\n[noise] well it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and it was a very hot summer day and he said it was nice\nOh before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing that he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations on the European\nCommunity signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion the the first thing is that uh the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money\nMhm uh we have a\nWind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations and there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state\nJust to post an article on CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had\nA one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\n... yet and I think it came from the sun well I Hope so too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so\nSo in the last decade we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense so people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work\nUm the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads but I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to\nFeel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions\nAbout climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh um what was Hurricane Florence mhm and last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century other ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent\nAre stronger or the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more\nFloods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nWe have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green blocks Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot com ... ...\n... the new version of the ... a a map is now will be ... in now enjoyed ... ... on demand anywhere anytime ... dot com and downloaded to the\n[noise]\n\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast\nOr the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion of those for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy\n[noise] um I and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been\nExaggerated to a very very big extent so I discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's fun to read it say a color paperback and a\nLot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper\nBy the way for size it's a heavy blocked\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons really put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarizes some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\n... with climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nCould be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created\nBy all sorts of things including a camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\n... who you know one of my simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet it's way way down there oh yeah I'd like Lance and dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but\nI Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah\nSo Nineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy ... the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems and so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame\nSaid that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death and the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output\nBut the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping\nThe fertility rate the number\nOf of uh children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat's a drop in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was foreseen at all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd a benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and or affiliate KFI and as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in junk strength strewn all over the place\nWhere his dad was a scene you know four new seats in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at the homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dump them or you wear a pollution\n[noise] uh it certainly is that it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now\nI'm at the government of California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in so you just add about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\nWell ... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills a that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states and then just now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling\nUm but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nIt's right or the idea that ah that C. O. two as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gas is number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air\nYou got to clean that up\nBut the greenhouse gases\nAre are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nYou talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of all evil is this\nYeah well we've had a ... a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new a minister\nOf Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out\nAnd leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep

across the world uh uh that's uh that's about the little less than ten percent of the world's population used to be thirty percent Thirty years ago so are people are\nAre getting more nourishment uh they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated um it used to be that every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds\nNow every decade it's less than a million people died so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] uh you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in Los Angeles hey barb welcome to the program good to have you with us\nI have any teeth thing taken tasked with the uh gas final contest\nFirst of all and there's a lot of work being done with a tentative Danny king and you have faith that frequent guest on your head David ... less alcohol and gas and he's not ...\nI'm ... I take with that and then secondly Oklahoma has more earthquakes in way dealing California from oil drilling fracking primarily\nAnd last year and actually that\nIs true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like\nWell that's what I mean by the Frank yeah well you're right indirectly it is\nBut uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to solve by geologist uh they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve that this entire planets should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope that never happens and\nAnd you know all we can do though with with these things is adapt that's what we\nThat's what we do with the storms that's we do with sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but ... with weather but not on a global scale\nI'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nHow to British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nFellow man that's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it a George ... first then if the current age as the information age use or are the cutting edge and you'd have my total respect I think you Mr Gura them\nI say I am the Lone Ranger [laughter] I have lost\nMost of my credibility a killer researcher but people think I'm Crazy or an idiot and bringing up these these arguments that you do it means nothing there's [laughter]\nIt's a boom warming is a very sexy position\nBecause people feel smart and that if I just you know say my bottles or do whatever I'll save the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard before but a big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited like Mr Gura to address this or the Ninety thousand cargo ships at sea they're pumping [noise]\n\nSee they're pumping [noise] Sulphur into the air that\nMust have a profound effect on 'em well there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high sulfur fuel fairly furry dirty fuel um and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization I shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower so for fuel types and a lot of folks in the industry think that is going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime [noise]\nUm there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems we need to clean up we also need to do a little or improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's\nAnother issue that we need to work out and then working as Asian was the international maritime organization\nThank you that's [laughter] that's it and they're they're predicting that the the increase is going to be huge or in the next several years by twenty fifty if no action is taken the increased by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump the sulfur yeah [noise]\nUh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to Bruce in Portland, Oregon Hi roots go ahead\nHigh high high on her yard and thank you for failing my blank spaces that I have no control over that\n[laughter] okay no I'm Serious I'm\nBack in ... I think we ought to hit board um right now and if they give it some kind of a of a plan that they can\nMake our world more free I'm\nA ... paying it forward now putting our technology here in in a place where we can bring our energy where it all in the free for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it\nAnd that might be here that that you are here donate you making our our uh dams in a\nEcosystem better and I've done that ... ... even even the little people out here like ... and ... is bigger than I Am can pay it forward right now\nThink that we all can live free I mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nAre just about I think it's almost Ninety nations that have that have a form of democratic government so it's gone from zero to Ninety nations and with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law limitation of slavery\nWomen's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's going to collapse overpopulation we've got pollution we've got all these terrible things but people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nSee what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most\nHeartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it what do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um\nA price us here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the euro the nations in Europe have higher or electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world are right now we're the biggest petroleum pollute the producer\nSo should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that\nThey're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during implement weather and they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nHold on Steve we've got a break and

many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter]\nBut the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate laws on the energy laws are foolish and in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority are so it's a little bit of a strange situation\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm\nAre they concerned about anything\n[noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that ah temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and the low of too tense and if you put those on a chart those rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're we're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the\nThe rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong\nAnd natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York to east of the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nSteve interesting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but less than a and a comment a got a quick uh my first question what they are we just had a and a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said\nThat they weren't really warned that\nThat was supposed to be a week and that was working with the people could have got out and all of this thing so I I relate this to a\nOcean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and to satellites come into play with anything to do with that second question what the\nAh the political climate you know ... all I talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a ... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the tourist and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial but he's already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or the Washington Post and then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry uh was traditional and I think it's\nA like a lot of people a potential but fast the waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO to if you look at shutting all ball that's still\nOnly buried it's still active it's not a bank contained nobody can go within fifty miles of the place all these years later\nSo uh you you take New York for example you got to the point right now and I'm a big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you've got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of 'em one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they're the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and chips and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\n[noise] the um\nThe thing you said about uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve its I Need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants so most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems and if the cooling systems fail fail like happened with the Saddam in Japan and then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved\nUm the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant\nAnd I think the third one was\nUm satellites\nWell you said something about governments and\nWhat's your question yeah I'm\nWondering do I I think you know ... or undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of a arguably more than half of the\nUnited States so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it\nUh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so I'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we've gone to an exploration from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless forever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica and built a big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue this many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is a nice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nGot we've got a guess Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of a nice\nWe've got against Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of a nice age ... who knows Walter in Pennsylvania and taken away well go ahead\nGeorgia needless to say I did talk to you once again George\nThank you sure you're out with all due respect Mr Gore I'm sounds a lot like a doctor Kimball mhm\nGeorge with all due respect to most of them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited though I think George I think it's just common sense\nAbout the human population on this planet cannot including ... and ... now a\nGeorge we share this planet with myriad other species are not modern library culture may have allowed a kid and uh\nYou know the ancient a bane of law I'm Simon but modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat in Africa the human population eat driving the yellow he puts things shouldn't\nJust as in this country are you know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo bites and oh so you know naturally you you could not twenty million a big way\nBy sitting hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't ...\nIt would be compatible with the er agriculture wind up by horribly wrong we have a expansion fields of corn and soybeans in week so uh you know I just think it's common sense about the human population now cannot increase ... and a lot of them\nWill there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nUh we're certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think with sixty million bikes and at one time estimates of those days are gone there are some good news there are some good it was by the way Dr Ehrlich of the one set of he was a betting man he predicted that by the year two thousand England would no longer exist\nBecause of population growth fees but one of the guys was maybe been wrong or the most times it publicly in history\nThere are

some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping undecided the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up\nFor dinner so he had caught a few brook trout lead among the rock and\nWhen he turned over Detroit we're gone now\nHis first instinct was the raccoons took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happened to me fishing that connect quiet river or wherever I heard a little Russell in the bushes and I turned to my head and a rainbow I had laying up on the side of the river ah I see a raccoon stick\nIt in a little\nLeft and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought so\nA little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at almost ground level and the huge hand grasp\nThe pile of fish not just one fish in one school grab numerous fish and retracted back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that\nIt was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that\nWhere it had reached out at ground level his tent was set up a buck fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make his way out with a canoe but he had said that\nHe thought it was a big ... obviously what else has a long hair rearm in a big hand standing out of the bushes and then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly in other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nIn ...\nAnd was able to know that he was fishing saw him fishing short when he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself or in such a way where we could get up there to\nGet the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him\nWhen he saw the first group of British missing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe and he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons in the act but\nWhat he caught was not a raccoon at all\nAnd uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports Honda people describe the creature in terms of height neuro big hobby\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a\nAnd I had a point to yeah\nYeah a lot of people say the comical shape Ted is varieties of ah a hair for coloration ranging from like salt\nAnd pepper chew a lot of people use the term or burned or read a and then of course brown and black so there seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost cylinder local body very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term\nAnd then there's the other one that appears\nAgain and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or a this you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the ... degree type of body extremely muscular or the chest you know bold jing thighs you know just like a a real monster\nSo these these are the things that people are seeing and then it just varies a I had one I'm\nA one story called decreased and\nAn incident I named it with this fellow claimed that his trees stand who is twenty five feet\nIn the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet\nAnd this sasquatch and a group above the sasquatch is it seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was bow hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said\nHe recognized as a hunter that these our noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd as he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces\nA sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grab the heel of his boo\n[laughter] think about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong and this measurement nobody sits there trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his feet or ... I don't know Seventeen something\nHad to have tremendous height and reach but the amazing thing about that story was the way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boots\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost or what that is just wanted him to know that they can do that that they could sneak up on him and ...\nAnd then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nYou know the name of your book big food here in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot I ... I take the stand as to what is more terrifying\nIs it terrify is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder road or is it more terrifying to have one flunking you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people are\nA lot of the encounters a somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion they're chasing the people out\nThey want to monitor regions and so they they\nDon't want them now and I think if you push the envelope are you going to be in the sorry state of affairs a when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and\nAs a when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave him to him he gave them one\nBy telling you right\nNow George that big foot if I see that big foot I'm going to get we'll like pop up on a Kansas\n[laughter]\nWe're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a call running out of the\nWilliam does anybody ever report Bebe big ...\nI have a I Do have an account oh this is very interesting another fisherman and here's the thing George I believe that\nAside from the accidental sightings which there are numerous ones the vast majority of these\nSightings of being hand by people who are out there doing things that your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal a normal but they're doing things are involved in things that the average person does not do the hunters and fishermen\nThere in remote areas uh the loners they're people who were getting out and going into places for peace of mind to exercise whatever the case may be and\nIn so doing they enter into this realm where these creatures seemed to be a now

to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York well what do they do anyway\n[noise] well they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries ... their goals from the website where that they were run into a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action\nOr some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke bond key move from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nUh-huh all the old man no Wolverine spoken a\nSo quite a quite a bit group also a big public relations steely claim a five hundred and thirty five million people were reached and three hundred and news articles written so a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would uh and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change a light\nBulbs they can save polar bears ... if we all drive electric\nCars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they\nThey are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nIsrael pollution to fix that's\nCorrect I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods over the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting with a cold real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment [noise] things like carbon monoxide nitric oxide so for a day I'm\nThe mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a odorless harmless invisible gas and what I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\n[noise] well it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and ... it was on a very ...\nYeah oh before Congress and they it was a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations and the European\nCommunity signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion the the first thing is that uh the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\n\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money\n... uh we have a\nWind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state\nJust a post an article on CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing is forest fires well\nWe've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nYet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had attempt of degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work [noise]\nUm the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads but I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to\nFeel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh um what was Hurricane Florence and\nLast year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOr their ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger or the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more\nFloods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nWe have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\n... the new version of the ... in now enjoyed ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded to the [noise]\n\n\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there\nThey are forced to do many things uh that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nOf the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion those for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy\n'em and they're taught in universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been\nTo a very very big extent so I discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color paperback and a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper\nBy the way for its size it's a heavy blocked [laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons really put it that way also\nHired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kind of summarizes some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nWhen which climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago management\nIs could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and uh yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas golds theory of abiotic oil that the planet\nIs God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\n... who you know one of my simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet he's way way down there oh yeah I'd like Lance in dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you've got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and that it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining\nUm infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems and so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in the Nineteen seventies and Nineteen eighties [noise] but they didn't\nUh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate and number\nOf of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat's a drop in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years\nAnd so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd to benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and or ... KFI and as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in junk strength strewn all over the place\nWhere he said was this and you know four new seats in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at is homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call wasted dumped everywhere or pollution [noise]\nIt certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though if I might\nThat are a problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo you just add about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation [noise]\n... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills a that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states and then just now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling\nUm but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nIt's right or the idea that ah the CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these pictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the air's that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases greenhouse gases number one is water vapor\nWhat's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible so if you can if you can see the air\nYou got to clean that up\nBut the greenhouse gases\nAre are really not causing air pollution\nOr so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... is this\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolt now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um\nWe had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new a\nMinister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leaving the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords [noise]\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up in Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years up in Ontario a premier Doug Ford took over\nAnd within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar contracts they eliminated\nI'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credit\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax that California has said so we got to write a paper revolts going on in California says they want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants are electricity rates right out there right now are are fifty percent greater than any other western state\nIn the in the forty eight states fifty percent\nFifty percent nobody you guys are fifty percent higher than any other state and um it's going to go much much higher deep deep carbon is Asian many studies have shown is going to increase the rates double or triple so I'm predicting within the next ten years of rate payer revolt California as well", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "03"}
