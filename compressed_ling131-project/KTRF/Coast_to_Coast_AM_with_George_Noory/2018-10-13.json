Jeffrey seal and back with us internationally recognized professionals psychic\nExorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on Huntington homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as spirit guide as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time a in a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individual in the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition um it's harvest time and ah in the tradition of that but\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is\nThat I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that definitely\nUh we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth and this is a huge target for demonic spirits\nAlso negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power and changed the world for good or for ill\nAnd ah I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counter part of angels there that powerful they are not regular\n... there was that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved\nAnd may have not ever lived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds\nOf individuals' a very easily\nAnd ah we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a\nFrom Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the pack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah\nDemonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route\nAnd actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better equipped to ah influence people\nOn a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trans for information\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other other people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nSee that's one I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits\nAre ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that a demonic spirits ah can change you know once\nThey were no positive spirits and their ego got for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nA so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirits do not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically\nAnd we all communicate ... kind of like a river that travels underneath\nOur consciousness and they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead and they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things but demonic spirits are very powerful and as an exorcist\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking forward to a vet the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nForty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration and is very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form\nAt a moment's notice can you see them I can you ... I was\nBorn with the ability to seize spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with the school work and some are looking at me\nLike how can you see me what are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and started walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about the\n... the new version of that goes to ... am apple is now available for I'm bone in now enjoyed ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today's [noise]\n[noise] you know people who have that gift draw lines I get the get go I mean small presence debate brand names you can find it\nEvery every week on the news is suffering town every young I'm seasonal car and get everyone on you nicely nice pricing have even more let me see ... ... for every one point you know there's an ... figure the smaller trying\n... to ... ... so I had I lodged top condition is also the biggest killer who stopped taking kind of war it was just incredible feeling that I never saw before ... ... when I have the ... two and a half months later\nSomething amazing ... which really ... hot actually contract almost staggering it that this was the staging a cheaper comes back to\n...

goes goes [noise]\n\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so are they attack\nChildren and their cribs the ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them and they communicated with us tell a path to be the end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family\nTo destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroy their family destroy their lives and also ... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they want to\nSell they sure do ... and we have to stop\nIt and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying that it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits\nThey generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can influence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd so when we're angry bathroom they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't\nKnow that there are there and they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death from something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and\nIt is to do things he would not normally do and Monica spirits are just experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make off of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die or an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating\nAnd thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see making spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage we\nThink it's our own but it's not always\nCompletely our own are they under the direction of the double Jeffrey I'm not\nAre they under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I ... the demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they\nMost often work alone but that's not always the rule uh they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight\nUh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them is incredible and we just don't see it coming um I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing a the very\nSame thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle there's no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nJust horrible they have they just have humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves\nAnd then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on and a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize that we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other\nBecause we're being used\nAnd it's not just you know I heard some talking on the commercials about global elitist and all of that and I think all that's true but also we're being attacked by non physical entities they wish to see the human race fail and there's a possibility that that\nBegan every mindful action to gamble having\nAnd they don't\nYou can join the the ... year\nAt ... dot org together we can be useful [noise]\nDamage in tears mega millions I'm

of yet\nWell definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loose ends up emotional energy boosters up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense\nCoal poll there's many substances that work very very well loosening up energy is kind of like spring something on the wall to get something off of it\nBut it doesn't alone get rid of the home\nSee that's the problem is is that stage will release it you know out into the atmosphere but\nIt will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property\nIn order for it to be removed because\nEssentially what I think that's going on here to Jay is the you've been releasing it\nBy doing these you know really positive things sage Franken sense all of these things you know I'd recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home\nIn order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent\nBut emotional energy negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kinda like you know taking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage\nThese things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the orders not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is their spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy that's negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields\nAnd we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching TV um you know a pub just every place there is emotional energy enter Bonnie Sanders she feels that we don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy positive and negative\nAnd causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not always just demonic spirits the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to\nGee I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's gone right natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Teri go ahead\nAnd uh yeah George or I guess what I'm a ... of the original language of the scripture and I'm actually writing a book called the we really ...\nAnd I tell you the Bible in the navy big I've dealt with a lot of the party a thing and I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist ah theories and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous people work hand in hand\nFirst prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a pattern of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe\nAnd then comes the physical fill the non physical proceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so\nEspecially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with a physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eight years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with it I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially so I Believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think when you're doing this marvelous you know I I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to a jury for the other question go ahead Jerry\nAh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches African ... go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach uh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy\nThe problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if it's a relationship between you and God now why is that well to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs deity Jesus means humanity in crisis means anointed one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then uh our entire life we we are and have you been Paul's that does that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls in a moment on the

California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir and Jeffrey\nGreat work that you're doing Jeffrey my question is about war and the battle field in war zones how tell us\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica salt I'm not talking about just\nBattling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battle field situation and you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are messages through our rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a\nA a place where negative spirits are attracted to demonic spirits negative spirits as well terrible things are happening and so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods\nThere are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves\nTo protect us from the effects that negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us were just natural and the battle situation\nAh emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves and the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take the stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds you need it fast\nYou know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all of that stuff when I go to the service\nTen minutes for the morning in ten minutes in the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know if we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy of this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also uh off\nThe fear and here so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what ... what I'm involved\nIn is not religion I Would not have to say is really a metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientists do not call me up and argue with me\nThey are right I deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack and also negative emotional energy by\nNegative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad\nAnd scariest situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy a person's life a hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out if they destroyed a business\nAnd they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react sometimes violently\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have a failed business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in her business after business comes in\nAnd you have problem is a failed dismisses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along is kind of like our our second family we have a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially we have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits because if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate\nOr a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub a business or restaurant and saying you know what\nYou were living environment a pub or a business a restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what they're picking up on George is emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on\nEverybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right it's emotional energy and it needs to be cleared out so they attack businesses because they can actually make a business failed and you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others\nWith their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go to the Monique ... son ... son ... California Hi Monique go ahead\nHi ...

God he's yes and then and now they're\nSide will talk about demonic here that my first question the question is I've seen numbers on clock\nAnd addresses a triple number for a while you're working I

journey now how old was he he was eleven\nNow that's not tools for a cat is\nNo it's not as I was really hoping he'd be here a few more years and um but his time was it was time for him to go sadly and I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yep absolutely told me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a wide range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nA while what why are they here and and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blame the watchers first humanities ills and\nThat's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that they were here they came from the heavenly round from the rump called sigh on according to the Bible the location of God's throne\nThey're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity a teaching about how humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the earthly realm through the heavenly realm of sigh on it it seems that that what's happened\nIn the intervening centuries and by the way it was the watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and then it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed\nBy the ... the idea scenes\nApocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being angelic being maybe even an extraterrestrial some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers and the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary\nBetween flash and light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes did they not right to did see squirrels as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty Seventy when the scenes were attacked the Roman army came into\nInto Jerusalem into Gallo lady a scene bundled up their sacred tax which there were many hit them in caves and they were last until Nineteen forty seven when they were were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers are the ... ... realm are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new blood lines after the time of the flood\nThe second point is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings\nLight being ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies and face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status and then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the ... and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting but if you're following that path\nChances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax left by the scenes and you're realizing that at the seams themselves were utilizing\nAncient texts and teachings that they had developed and synthesize from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the factor is\nThat we are centered on how do we contact the watchers one and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen\nThis group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years before the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings\nTo congregate with the angels the holy ones the angel of the lord the watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLight in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\n[noise] I I don't think so because when you look at the morality of the the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is\nMeans that they're evil beings or that they are being who were\nAre somehow demonic they their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will heavenly realms and took human body fat is they're great sin they crossed what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross\nThe church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out God's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they descended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality ...\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others simply decided that they were\n[noise] demonic beings that they were a powers that were beyond human control and certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand\nOr experience the rapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing the line that the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach humans how to do how to turn into angels William\nIn your book to watch is you do talk about a luminous clouds were gods rude on them to me it sounds like CSI keels we'll it sounds kind of you and foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds isn't to feel which is the ... where we get the word and to feel I'm from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and in the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of Judeo Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus\nRiding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds and what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension body they're light Audi it's\nIt's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota it's actually an organic light vehicle\nThat is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimensional a and throughout the cosmos\nTalking with William Henry whose latest work the watchers of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative miss all it just goes after\nThese gone that the visited us spiritual or physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their\nBodies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to the stories transform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full a buys they're covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches what the Tibetans describe as the\nRainbow body of light in the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us is that our ...\nOur body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails\nThat have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this\nAnd I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers and so these watchers could could step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency manifest in physical form\nAnd then face back into their non physical light being for well\nWhat did they want you was there an agenda\nIn my view when you follow the ascension path of of the watchers that they were here they came here in on a on a rescue mission they are the ... by the way they were not here for gold that that is Jack Ryan ... personal take on the", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with
