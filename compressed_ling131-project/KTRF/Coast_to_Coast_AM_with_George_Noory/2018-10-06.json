I think they're going to find if this was clearly a democratic yet\nAnd dragging this woman who is clearly delusional about a ... um you know a a a sexually assaulting her\nYou went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last\nTime he was ... she's always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they all is\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the life family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects and so anything that said\nThey can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or\nHow they look or you know they they like to know that stuff\nAnd but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where there's tables set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures them to Spiro will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said\nThe that lady with the hat on over there I said yep he said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay you know I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so so they're very interested in what goes on is very interesting [noise] usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there are yeah I ... at\nAny rate I go to this ... this particular funeral the man was standing at the foot of his casket and he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can\nAnd I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter found you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this and I just\nSort of look to your father and\nGave him aside look as though he said well call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet\nOh boy and I looked\nAt him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he call me crazy\nWas who was the brother going to try to do so thin or what was his\nWanted the collection of gun\nLow he wanted to just keep 'em from Salem\nRight so I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw on the half hour ago and I said point them out to me\nHe's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I and the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he learned to do to stir\nAnd she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and go down the basement and see what your uncle's doing oh sure enough this world will bill was breaking open the gum\nCabinet I'm going to ride on them\nUncle bill was breaking open the\nCabin and the parietal ... yep [noise]\nSo it it's interesting when

really nice to talk\nTo a couple of your loved one fifth fourth you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the deceased how many of them are young generally know that their debt\nEvery one of them\nHow do you not come out of your body and look down in your spirit lead the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am\nDead so they're not in denial they are not and I know there's some psychic sent me the and said that they don't know they're dead but I mean not all of them you don't how do you not know you and I would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but that doesn't really know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this was all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen it's gotta be depressing even for some of the uh the deceased I Would guess\nWell you said a lot of them are set because they think that they won't be able to see what's going on what their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth\nYou're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you'll get arms in pictures perfectly round

the bottom so [noise]\nWell I really believe it's pretty easy and you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is\nI mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day you're well what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and governors garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting\nThere in your kitchen watching him going oh you ... I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move you know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me\nI Will say a prayer for you exactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debts get\nNow can that person one realize this was happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember karma you know be careful who you try to throw under the bus you\nNever know what goes around comes around that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody\nThey pretty much know it easily the three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order\nIs health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going\nOut with a new person after the second data Joel right\nDown the toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and how to remove negative energy once that's taken off ... and anybody can remove negative energy off of somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone you find the same thing with health if a person has occurred some them and they've got a bad health\nProblem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the tea scared and you had blood work done the doctor goes no everything is normal there's nothing

be conjured up that way but when someone puts a curse on an individual mhm does the individual\nWhat happens to them do they feel something did they see I think some would put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down to two but you'll lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head or if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and\nPeople don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life and everything gets going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go gene ... luck for the last\nYear what the heck's wrong when you [noise] and then you start thinking about it and like I said you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr do something about it have it removed it's not hard to do you can\nDo it and as long as you know ... actually a person doesn't even believe they have a curse on him and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who thought they were entitled to that job yet and she did it fair and square and you know decent and everything she's great girl\nAnd but strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well things were really kind of screwed up and she called me up one day it's a papa\n... I think somebody put a crush on me and and I said ... let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh huh and I said a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being a person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop sending negative energy to hurry war off right exactly so\nMy question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who puts a curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words did you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\nWhen meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it get get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get it off\nNo you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nHe is every buddy susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up this force field to kind of block it and shield it\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to\nDoesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something on every full moon or generational curses\nThey just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were cursed\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about in ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does\nIts negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's where I go home she has an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers and the slump bloodshed yeah Julie\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ballplayers\nLook the dead fans that goes that

earlier and I was just wanting to say um we just need to really mellow out [laughter]\nWe really do\nThere's there's just so much a negativity and\nSo much pressure in the culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of mass anxiety and um maybe that's\nPart of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh uh tools like a tarot cards or believe it or not [laughter] um are very very helpful for remembering who we are and I'm\nLetting go of all of the [noise] uh [noise] beliefs and programming and constructions and opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff\nAnd taking a deep breath and receiving um through images through pictures that come to us from a really a\nMysterious place nobody knows the origin of the terrible courage to tell you the truth we know some things about it it ultimately the child is a mystery\nWe know that it it it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that it has been called the perennial philosophy\n[noise] um but there is something I'm universally relevant for everyone in the Tyrone\nHow far back as we've been able to track the tip\nOf Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence or fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the accounting and renaissance but no one knows who the first desire was actually\nIn I I really like that I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from above some\nUh from above or from beyond or or below [laughter] below or within\nAnd you know I'm a union psychologist so ah we've then is to a place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is\nUm it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not brought a\nTo Europe by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed or actually the gypsies chain quite a bit\nAfter the first tarot decks uh started to emerge a in Italy and a Spain um other places in Europe\nUh it is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the ... actually\nIf you think of the standards set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are Connor of the ...\nThe ... has an additional twenty two cards\nThat is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of Cairo card you know they have they have the magician\nRyan old card a fool and wheel of fortune and things like that and that's your favorite car George yes it is [laughter] save her because I'm fascinated by\nI Know I Know you are and it is it is an extremely a beautiful card the draft card as is the devil card\nAnd the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most uh uncomfortable parts of the major are coming up but every card in the tower jak has a positive and negative aspect um\nAnd the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it became very a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot a really was birds with the weight jak or the Arthur wait\n... the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of Jericho in that for the first time the minor are caught and which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the tips or the miners\nWere finally illustrated with rich dynamic pictures that tell a story before that time\nYou make pictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the the pardon the expression Trump Card\n... uh where we're going to talk about that on the right\nBut I'm only those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and get an impression of him and kind of just kind of sense of what was going on there\nThe miners before or the twentieth century um just had geometric design so if they're forced suits you know like my heart's clubs diamonds and what's the other one a day it's\nRight those are equivalent to the tarot the terrorists shoots of a cops swords tentacles ... won ...\nAnd all of those minor cards she's had geometric\nShapes on them so if it was a seven of cops there would be a just a picture of seven challenges on it say and that's all you had to go by\nNow there is a very rich dynamic a damage that goes with the meaning of that card and\nUh there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different tarot decks today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic tarot convention so that it doesn't really matter which jak you're using and some are very out there even my deck is pretty out there\nThe night you came up with your own new\nYes correct um but it's the same architect so you know the card is in the car has an image and the idea is that\nWith an archetype an archetype is virtually any exhaust herbal but it's only known through an image or archetype ... image\nSo uh like Joseph cambell wrote a great book called the uh what is it called the uh uh ten thousand names of the uh I Can't even remember what book I'm referring to but the idea is slate George\nA lawyer in his late [laughter] I Love it though\n[laughter] but the the idea is that uh every archetype like say the cherry edge or where are the hero here with a thousand with the housing faces with whatever the name of that book is\nCan be a illustrated and many many ways you know one image that describes an archetype so that lends itself to artistic interpretation so\nTerrorists also a richly interesting a visual art and different tarot decks emphasize different aspects of the archetype but it's the same archetype Britain to same a principle [noise] I'm In ...\nWhen we talk about the archetypes I'm In a union sense\nUm we're ... we're talking about a special group of archetypes and these are called what you own Carl young the great a Swiss psychologist and philosopher it's\nCalled the archetypes of transformation\nThat you were with a thousand cases that's not ... thanks do you think this guy\nUm [noise] but it's it's the archetypes of transformation is what the major are kind of the towers that means these are the images are the archetypes those are all about spiritual transformation and are\nNot in a religious sense\nBut more in a sense of um the uh the destiny of the human being the completion we're the home is of um what it is to be a human being\nThat is believed to actually uh to be hardwired in the brain\nUm and that through evolution we have been a unconsciously are playing out are following a certain blueprint certain a basic what you know you could say psychological instincts", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year":
