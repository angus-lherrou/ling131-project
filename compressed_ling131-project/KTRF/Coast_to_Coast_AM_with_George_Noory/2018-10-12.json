our version that said I mean I don't I don't know what else are you and they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it\nSeems like we're at the point where either we should just build this thing out and expand it and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should just give up and let it crashed down to the markets with one of those two because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really has time for us to make that they\nSaid well we were very fortunate that we did not lose the astronaut and the ... not really have to say\nThanks Mark my beret his website is named Mike bearer B. A. R. A. dot com\nWell a story that's been all around the planet over the last several days as seems to be getting even worse now the Turkish government\nNothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the person and they don't have any net worth left to buy things\nWhen they're on us well what did the indicators I mean mark in the last two days has really taken it on the chin what's the cause for that is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will well two things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten thirty or bonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent\nIn less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh if China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide\nA downturn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates and um and and then more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nHum you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp\nRally for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people thinking\nOh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack these last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been boosting the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that what they do\nIf the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no this was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what happened here ... we had a couple more days of downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong here\n[laughter] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in ...\nRemember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in late January\nReal kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we had a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped and and and it stopped right about here\nYou know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's one of the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling ensuring the market\nIt happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing and every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bottles that first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths you know there were people get whacked\nAnd that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally the markets to look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders\nAre going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous\nUm uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial wants to know when somebody asked ... what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early\nBecause that's how this ... this is above all this isn't a normal bull market\nCorrection are nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and in half\nThe time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this this is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the signs to me you're building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen\nPercent or so correction by the end of the year then we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the right now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period [noise] what will\nThis is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking and and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean\nI'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and and their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like\nWent sideways and didn't deliver it to our debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred and ... trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world [noise]\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is flowing and and like I said they have the biggest debt bubble of any body and any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock\nCrash because they stop at with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just build a tub backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt everything's more stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and redo so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\nSe she was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back curious dance with us his website is his name Harry Dent D.

T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff syllable lifetime and zero\n... students on the new version of that goes to ... am happy knowable bribe bone and know Android who not only listen library on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... stadium dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently\nCracked and a lot of companies when other well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd upon Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know one hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down\nNinety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company and the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flap instead of declining the valuations on stocks how many times earnings why people pay\nThirty times earnings for the typical stock for an hour forty\nAnd and sixty or eighty for the best taxed on\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't declined and then of course most companies' earnings do decline\nSo that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator for looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know how it it's called the smart money\nYou know unless it's not a secret anymore\nWell I Know I Know believe me\nWall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened to their the smart money or the people who\nWho kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there the ones to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are both were bought in stocks or about they're the ones that short first\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff [noise]\nWell they you can measure\nThis action what if there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes\nI mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's going to open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves that may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour end of the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they'd been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael\nI had the whole my windows from blowing out my condo where it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable uh to watch everything I mean\nWindows blowing off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God got angry or something you know into\nThrough a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has the acres in ...\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and or or St Croix or St John and and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there and and I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place spending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming in\nAnd I said to my why don't we moved here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live\nAnd and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes an advanced they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to ...\nBelow al I'm not sure I liked that part\nWell it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane fly to scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing and landing on this island and one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify\nFor some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living in the crypto guys are coming down here because of that and businesses that can qualify\nThere's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper than a great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director Miami in two hours and and almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that the long haul now but I tell ya I\nI like it down here they been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years we're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent ear and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now and then\nThey don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now and then I'm just going to see what happens in the next are so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah\nYeah yeah about ... and ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are buying banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people\nEither just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or\nThey charge some huge acts and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like otherwise\nMan this is a good deal and you know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nMinorities need both in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that they are allowed to vote in our election\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving to the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides in the U.S is better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to use your best impressions on what you think will happen economic lead over the next year this country seems to be mired right now I'm conflict\nEmotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy when\nIt does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time and the zero our book\nThat that

we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nAnd like hey hey let let let me are real quickly you're right about the Democratic thing there's no way that that Puerto Rico's going to become a state now with the Republicans in charge\n'em and and and they want to become a state now they didn't before because they didn't get the help helping Maria [noise] they were you see if you go to Orlando I used to be in Tampa right near their Orlando is getting is are the ones getting these high call I'm telling you in Puerto Rico here there's a shortage of doctors Dennis professionals everything because those are the people most moving so\nIt may not be happening Rochester but you go to Orlando or Texas\nYou're going to see a different story and most of the Puerto Ricans in the fifties and sixties moved up into the northeast but the\nThey're mainly moving into Florida first and in places like Texas so it is it is a mixed bag but I agree with you a hundred percent there is this red blue war and it is serious and there is going to be\nA lot of tensions and civil unrest and if there's this much now imagine what it would be like if we had Fifteen Percent unemployment in the U. S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension and that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the less than a crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact of the Hispanics in most African American you wrote in a democratic big deal ... what what was his point\nWell he well he's saying that that you know the the rich people don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red wars or when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled well I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to\nThose Puerto Ricans the Republicans and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson are running for Senate they're both courting the Puerto Ricans because they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do use in\nThat one democratic ... isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question Georgia and good morning I'm just like the ... I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back\nBut blue states subsidized they're red states and ... and the state that receives the most was Kentucky where the idiot McConnell was I'm a destroys me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us an SOS the mid west [noise] ... um for your guest\nI've been reading the Financial Times for many years and what you're saying this was a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement if it were thirty five years almost forty years or entity which was nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over from the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost could obliterate his go we have a meeting with thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks that are into the camera and I don't trust in the budget on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and I'm Frank rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back but the thing is what do we ask our\nFinancial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air [noise]\nYeah you know real quick there there's two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury\nPush down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more and but but you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's got more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive a pension plan today the best thing you can do\nWhat we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bombs or corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stock dip it in but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down an interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates so right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors and pension funds to lock in quality bond it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bonds lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stocks the worst place to be for pension plan is to do with everybody that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all their life okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California when the northeast and the west coast succeed from the union it'd be would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in the California Hey Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research and I really appreciate it um [noise] I Need you know\nYou brought up earlier that a corollary to depression and major recessions in war and you could argue that the world today and saying hey\nThird world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea et cetera and one global Harper rations cannot compromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states into a third world country\nAnd a day or two you know with a lecture magnetic poles cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan I'm there but but what we're\nSaying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge into World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two and with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising terrorists just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China\nWhether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because nobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we would so I think that's kind of a good thing\nOr in in the early Nineteen hundreds ... Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have a political\nHuge political jeez this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike Harry with us for coming back from final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show up the right to your inbox for free with the new newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd now China has made it even easier checkout blind no to a cellular shades first and only ... installed without screws or tools because listeners take up the present on any learner just east coast can't check out that's blind dot com lines T.

in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jay ... go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market is the new sectarian has to do with the ... and I happen to get in and mid July just before the infusion in the ... the gross but the average company\nWhich happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nFrom about fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio\nBut my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly and kill the election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking you then have it on the ballot and if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of like an upswing or would you pull out of that and now because of this age of what you're talking about taking place\nWell you know that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit\nBut the the the strongest sectors get hit the most because they bubble up the most and people don't understand that\nSame with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop but yes I Do think\nCenter in such a hot sector take your games see what happens in the next few years especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term\nSocial political Trent it's going to go in that direction\nAlthough there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector all do All right because\nI went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn and and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear\nFactor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so\nYeah take your games yeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out how do you know what should the blond oh your ... how do you know when the ... back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything is different this is not\nLike you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent that's more typical this is more like these great resets ... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets\nWhich of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent as kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the ...\nEighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent\nThat's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn\nIt's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money\nNext step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then and and and these sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise]\nWait for the ... you may get to buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nOn that one is in Paducah, Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yeah OK ... Democrat Democrat or a\n... then they do not signing earner did I miss I understand you that you said the south was read during the civil\nWar\nThey they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party had to convince\nA lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican\nBlue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans Hoover coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a ... in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are our long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican era here to a democratic\nA long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican era here to a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the rich people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats if it's a play of opposites that's\nJust as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite and it goes back and forth the same thing\nThe west has dominated the world uh since since the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend we can\nClearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation this country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term is surprisingly predictable and that's where Congress get it wrong Congress think the short term predictable\nI'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I told told people Twenty years ago baby boomers are going to peak in two thousand seven in the economy was going to slow down and those gears that was not I guess that's

found that certain people are better rather than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\n[noise] um yeah that's true someone who say will say well my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nThat's right that's right yeah I in fact I had a great a great aunt that an experience where she fell asleep and she woke up and she said her brother had died he was living in another country and shortly afterwards she found out yet to better use died\nWhile yet but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do [noise] but you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women and I think that's probably true plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\n[noise] I Would say both I Would say that these are sort of um cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences that protest in the brain\nSo for example if you take the example of out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and I was quite young\nI had one at all I've been I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little section I've ever had I mean there I was bouncing on the ceiling may looking at my body and bad I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother said uh George you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream man what a ... at that point it's lamb ... back into my body\nI woke up I was Gerard I'm eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me yeah ... actually I got my way into a library you know weeks later she stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and\nFound a book on an astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since then at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just find myself floating on the ceiling looking down at my body in bed\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience has there is a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... field who is able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on electrical stimulation on the right temperature attacks he's able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nBut that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the ... and that tells me that the that everybody's being will protests the out of body experience um and you know the types of out of body experiences we had was quite straightforward\nUm they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around\nNovel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that to the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a believer I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and how it's affecting your medical student at ... exam the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam is the same as the first question in my green\n... you have the answer that you knew\nExactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with them or they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite\n[noise] but I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences\nIt's quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that the word heron or a month for example the ... pero mean beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on\nThe parent normal I mean beside normal it doesn't mean have normal and there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere it will come up to me afterwards and share it with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\n[noise] so I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about this thing\nAnd that was really what motivated me to read the\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ...\nNo I'm not familiar with her ... her oh her\nAnd it was my aunt\nAnd she ... she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yes and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy\nAnd when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced\nTotally convinced that the ... the was the real deal and the and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] although I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting Ron breakthrough to creativity I'm definitely gonna look for it but you know they're\nBeing on books written by physicians about near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who for having me up and he's a neurosurgeon and marry the Neal\nShe wrote to heaven and back she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks is and they're all just he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that so I mean she she just do the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFell than there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show her no yeah that's terrible ... how does he get\nInterested in philosophy\nShe just always was and there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying dream telepathy\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to an e G so I'm the AG could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... dream state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to the ... and they found that people were more susceptible to lead to to let the when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more susceptible to a lot of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but\nIn my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr Mandy majors where those his book the borders of normal [noise]\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available for I don't know Android for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\nGo to close to ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice with dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm Ted someone who's coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors\nAnd as they got closer to death is that it became more frequent and these visitors are these visions rent is\nDeath is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise] [noise] so yeah I think\nThose those deathbed visions are very common\nNow one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and she says someone who's a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who were at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not the not so unusual isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying patients saw\n[noise] and that's interesting because\nYou know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brains they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut it's a vision or shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction their brains and they weren't on medication so\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWhen Steve and Steve Jobs from apple computer died many you know that he was quoted as saying\nOh wow oh wow\nNow what do you think he he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision you know I'm a a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love\nYou know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs is experiencing\nYeah that could be that could be no skeptics of course say what the you mentioned that you know it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the ... how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the the patients who who died and where we ... Eighteen percent of them had a new report in the near death experience but it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain\nNot just a ... a small percentage [noise] so you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that\nUm these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they'd be getting reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication versus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and he didn't have a shortage of auction to the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical but it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true and you you've talked about under deathbed the vision that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain that\n[noise] well the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician Melvin Morris who worked his dying children and he said the dying children didn't report deceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the costs and\nDid anybody else either\nNo so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them\nBut in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they recalled minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next\nLevel of the next world and they were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nDid they see you\nI don't think so oh okay I don't think there were there for me I think there were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... ... [noise] now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions [noise] you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals then why would the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these\nVisions of these people they are the person is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is a case where there was a car crash and ... all one brother died and the other brother was near death\nSo the the brother that was near death had the vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that rather was dead\nAnd the rather cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre ... did have dreams give us your thoughts on what they are\n[noise] well there again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the very powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pre cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream because often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they tried to protests things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about [noise]\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated the he he had a dream that he was murdered [noise] now we could say that that was a peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\n[noise] maybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to a soldier who is standing by chance good and it was him in the ...\nI heard that too yeah yeah [noise] so that could have been a ... another famous person who reported a ... interview with Charles Dickens\nReally I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put out a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to\nA reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that and\nAnd where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nIn a group of people came up to them after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with far words she said I Am ...

communicated\nHit it off huh\nWe just hit it off and when the night that she died I was sitting on the couch with bad weather we're having storm and I was doing laundry can sleep and I just knew something was wrong and then when I saw everything happening on the\nTV screen it just was like so surreal it was just\nThat was the first time\nI've ever had anything like that ever happened to me um I don't know if anyone else who's ever had that kind of I mean it sounds like what you're talking about two and then for my son died I had the same thing I had the vision of ... a dream for like two

daughters and several other friends happened now I have not in that very travelling\n[noise] okay well in terms of your question I charge what causes that well I guess I Would call that a pre cognitive dream or premonition [noise] you know\nAnd I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all connected and somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of\nYou know I'm I think that especially someone very close like a family member especially you know a child or sibling or parent or a spouse\nIf you want to communicate with the deceased loved one is it easier to be a little more aggressive to try to communicate with them or do you laid back and let them try to come to you\nI Would say it's the latter I Would let them come to you you know because they may not be ready\nDo you have to give them any signs that you're already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you're open to the

you hear me okay yeah I'm pretty good\nOkay great I'm willing to let you a couple of things one last night with your guest I called in but are too late to get on and it there's some commonality and some of the topics tonight about um the paranormal and\nAh you know something I consider to be quite a link between paranormal and the a Judeo Christian teachers in the Bible a\nLink it could be\nA the content of a book called eternal man and anybody can go bad or search on YouTube or Amazon\nYou can find different lectures and things about that and over the years of\nThis book written by a B. Y. U. religion of ... professor and over the years I just listening to coast to coast\nIt's just been quite remarkable that there there is so much of the paranormal uh that that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps\nTo give some other Sandy after ... of of the eternal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm to switch to another topic really quick or a ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by a listener on the coast to coast a lot about a year ago experiences\nTo friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other and about twenty five days after the second one I had a dream it was very vivid now this dream as for about\nThirteen Years ago I think\nAnd ah I can still remember today um I don't remember what happened before the than some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the events of the jury enlarge rape but\nThe but it was a very vivid and I want you to hold that thought and retain that fought in your

with you were in our final segment with Dr among many meets his his book is called the borders of normal and many when you were putting in the book together was there are some part of it are just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nI think the most interesting thing with the deathbed vision\nYou know because I left that game that I didn't realize how common that way [noise] you know we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and visions and out of body experience it associated with near death experience but I wasn't really ... with a deathbed visions or the visions of deceased loved ones that are also very common\nThe deathbed visions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something that is strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I like to look at it from the point of view of the body plus the mind of the most ... plus the spiritual life so I think that for different components in each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come across\n[noise] Mm that's a good question because there's so many of them I mean the cases have example people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win the lottery\nWow you know I'm I don't have those kind of dreams\nMe neither but that ... been verified [noise] you know I wanted to say one comment about your previous caller sure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition Mm mhm [noise]\nIf you look at the Bible they certainly lots of their profits like Daniel and as the keel or if example Joseph you know who had the cognitive genes are prophetic themes you might say and even in the history of the church people I think ... the the Joan of arc they heard voices\nYou know when when dealing with Thirteen Years old she said she thought lining light light and the herd of voice which he identified as the arcane to Michael coming from her father's garden\nSo these experiences have been documented and many people throughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is it's just remarkable how this works ... it's it's you know let's call it the God factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why should they were the first place what do you think\n[noise] the ... the first thing that came to mind if it's out there to make our lives more meaningful\nIt that's a different level or a different dimension to where I live and that somehow if that's something to feel like what we're going to even if it's a painful experience to have the meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be given by going to Joe in Long Island New York hey

ended up at the beach I go on the water to Little Rock but this other people's Wyoming and it's usually warm which would be the case had I Want but I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same day\nIn real life so my question would be with your dream about the past\nThe next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise] ah so I ask you about that you know what you think and the case that train for going to a really acting and your face\nUnusually ... being the night he passed it was three in the morning I was sixteen he woke me up at three in the morning and I was so sleepy that\nUm my brothers and sisters and I knew most of his brothers and sisters were dead

A. R. A. dot com\nWhile a story that's been all around the planet over the last several days as seems to be getting even worse now the Turkish government\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down to the person and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on well what did the indicators market the last two days is really taking it on the what's the cause is uh just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this what happened we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to a four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be\nCheating and a lot of ways by China's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates and um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nHum you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back down and we said look it breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it in ... did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking\nOh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first black these last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been to sing the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to grow up which it has and it causes\nGrows to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous and and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no\nThis was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose one happening like ... we had a couple more days of downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here\nYou know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude what happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling insured in the market it happened very quickly\nYou'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei in the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing and every other one in the last century including\nThe tech rack and recent bubbles that first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months\nWhen people get walk and that's the sign that that's the only way you know the bubble has finally burst the problem is by the time that comes\nPeople already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so we did a dangerous sign is if we keep going down and and and literally the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the balance after\nYou know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far\nBut it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand on the Dow if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders\nAre going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up that this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not fifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first\nLike Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again\nThe first half of that crash will happen in the first\nTwo to three months typically and bats what make bubbles so dangerous\nUh uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once somebody asked ... what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit because that's how ... this is above all this isn't a normal bull market\nThe correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles\nGo up dramatically and they crash and in half\nThe time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this this is a once in a lifetime of fat and it it the science to me you're building we'd been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauges we only get a normal ten Fifteen\nPercent or so correction by the end of the year that will probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the right now though the odds are shifting towards ah it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only decades in advance on demographics the baby boom picking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn out to the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last\nSeventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries to ... we were already too much in debt so we just kind of like\nWent sideways and didn't elaborate our debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy ... trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world and and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up the seat Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest debt bubble of anybody in any time in history\nWhen China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just build the top backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt everything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty percent\nOff absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back curious dance with us his website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime and zero one\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for iPhone in now Android ... listen libre on demand anywhere anytime good goes to goes to um dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six\nOr seven times kind of like the big point bubble here recently crashed in a lot of companies when other well which what were the survivors ... companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know\nA hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies when you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being ...\nNinety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is\nEven if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flat instead of declining evaluations on stocks how many times earnings like people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax on\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's not a secret\nWell I Know I Know but that believe me Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups up and and and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are both were bought in stocks over about they're the ones that short for his I mean they're in the know\nAnd and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action or there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything and so the market's going to open down it opens down\nRight at the open court opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that's the money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes\nSo they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they'd been shorting\nIt they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing up all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in ...\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming in\nAnd I said to my why don't we moved here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we're used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport\nWhich I get to twenty minutes in advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt below\nAl I'm not sure I liked that part\nWell it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane fly to scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing in landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify\nFor some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualified there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper than a great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director Miami in two hours and in almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did\nFor a long time that that the long\nHaul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about ... and ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are by bank of popular and Santander or Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people\nEither just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or\nThey charge some huge acts and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you that people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for\nFor people's ah kids in sixty percent lower\nUm I Believe they vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving to the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida and so these these older people realize their kids\nAnd most of them now are moving to Florida and so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they ended up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting\nHighly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people that's why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S\nIs better to help create good jobs down here to tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economically over the next year boost country seems to be mired right now here in conflict\nEmotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy when\nIt does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time and there's zero our book\nThat that we're not just seeing a major boom peak globally and a major bobble and debt bubbles and all this de leveraging it and that that's going to make the next couple of years very deputy leverage debt these bubbles burst I mean again somebody's stock account is worth two hundred thousand\nOne day and then a year or two later it's worth fifty thousand you know like what happened I just lost that money and it's not coming back this time you know my home was worth three hundred thousand now it's worth a hundred and fifty and I'm underwater and I can't even ... take advantage of the lower rates so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "12"}
