you can help solve a David joins me in just a few minutes and we will jump right into it\nFor those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make

in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first\nBut worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured all week leading up to this date that the town is remember those who died those who were wounded those who've struggled to deal with what they witness that night\nAt a town that proved to the world but it's much more than just an adult Disneyland or get away but it's a real community that pulls together when things get tough effect that seemed to surprised so many of the national news people I I remember watching them uh that week last year\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done\nAnd I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any listened missing people in their parks and jurisdictions and uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues ... refiled and they came back in the attorney called this time and said well why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that of the determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then it came back and he said well you don't have any listen missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are that detective\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or acumen who've list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nI said no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well they are just file a request and see how many rules of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that in tore list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my\nAuthors status as an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together a list or I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire\nSystem and I can't\nTell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because we still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll sit right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards that every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer\nThat can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even responded wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exists um you know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and uh\nSo we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the profile points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books the kinds of things that you look for\nCases that jumped out at you that make it into your book the kinds of things that you look for\n[noise] for people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read a report start making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four or five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue they can't I Can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked at a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot there\nMight be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there I've had reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person who was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest [noise]\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times but time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granite play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world to Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted place much more of a role as I have explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends to your loved one\nAnd they walk ahead of you you fall behind them at that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that and interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that had disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a medical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical clustering that I figured out after I started putting Ken's at a U.S map when I started to track this years ago and right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred and thirty five cases and its men women is a four to one ratio\nCorrect\nMy any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David Blaine is about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\n\n\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nThe national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times a lot of times they want [noise] there's a case from eighty six\nI'm an error the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years in a special agent told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspects there is no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal\nUh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you want to fall out of society you can\nAnd it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to eliminate from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody with these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nA lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it\nBut there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed of the public upon the crust Colorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you really can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time\nWhen I finally get a copy the report the news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nIt's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas ever been a couple that you and I talked about before\nIt's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of this scene um who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take a further are you you defer to them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they really don't want to tell the story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nYou know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it\nAnd I don't understand it I Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports\nWhen a sheriff's office helped on a search and they had some of the reports from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that\nBut then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a called vest per ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there on August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spade a lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\n[noise] round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top [noise]\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really\nMuch here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there and just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a walk right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him he reacted the right way he went goal he went out and look for her\nWhile the investigation showed that she made some at some time to in between two and three in the afternoon and some other ...\nSome at some time to in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her [noise]\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually published in the homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days\nThree hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked hundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday\nWhen you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual they had cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs\nEverything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because\nYou're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance with his family had a lot of gumption they started pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns are trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and search in day and night\nOf actually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kind of gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before down a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push [noise]\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is is what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and ... you'll understand this George is the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them\nBut they national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS\nThe national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up and then you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office and demand that they get more assistance and more help for you and you stay there until they realize you're going to be a thorn in their side so that they get you more help\nThat's kind of the reality of it\nIt's sad but it's true and there were dogs used in this one as well yeah there were multiple multiple times\nOne eight hundred six six\nSeven seven one eight hundred six six

trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood\nAnd for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old\nHe's an intellect super smart kid a was a a third year medical student the reports come from the clock in this county sheriff\nAnd uh when he was twelve years old as a gift for his birthday he asked his parents for the book called Grey's Anatomy\nKind of tells you where his head was that he knew he was he was going to be a doctor when he grew up\nHe graduated from Albion College with a ... biology degree five data campus in become loud\nHe was accepted Wayne State medical school first year medical school he was granted internship to the Mayo Clinic in June of Nineteen Ninety nine at the end of a second year going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years\nAnd he traveled to Oregon and check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure until the family wanted to see some wildlife mother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven\nJune nineteenth he flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from run Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostile checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paint Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement reports state on June twentieth Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them said idiot arrived all was well checked in things were great\nManager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and he was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast to Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the salmon view wilderness\nThey stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in a little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there essentially worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers ... Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nWell they exit the trail later that day and they still saw the car there and a bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and a deputy came out random registration on the rhetoric of the vehicle came back registered to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left well Steven was return was supposed to return to trade on July second and parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nWell they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person\n[noise] [noise] oh\nThe next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and a theme that some assistance from the national guard Cain ends in search teams\nSearchers face rain and wet conditions for many other days but again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praise the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey say that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything cadaver dogs were later put into that area never picked up ... percent\n... dogs were later put into that area never picked up ... percent\nThey uh they had a psychic approach them and the psychic went with them and some for service people down the trail the Cambridge switch back look down the cliff they saw little TPP structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nThey said that down there you'll find Stevens grasses and that's where he died search and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and the second city needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever from there\nAnd they are hoping ... said that they are now any communications with the sheriff and years not never with the forest service Stevens never been found [noise]\nStarting a search was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol Turner when she disappeared in her park ... left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out [noise]\nNow I say this every conference and I said on every time on I'm On with you people need to carry a purse to locate her because the cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there is no monthly service fee you can get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\n... whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but I you know a search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nI don't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen yeah I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and\nBreak your leg on the trail and die on the trail and I think that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and\nSomething very simple like this country ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psychic that got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever investigated a case where a psychic was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\n[noise] tell your story is um there's a remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people and ask them if you'd ever found anybody and he gave me the name of this person\nAnd I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to them I contacted this victims wife I said hey that this person to help you in finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody\nSomebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and\nAnd other remote viewing cases there was one guy did a conference with a ... a couple of years ago really nice guy and the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible now there's another guy who's a remote viewer\nThat I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight to psychics on this role at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this row introduce myself to every one of the psychics said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help and want to help for sure yeah we can do this I email each one of them the next week\nWhen I got back and I never got a response from one of\nWere talking about ... about his newest book missing for one more land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San

he dropped him off at a location in friendly at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry's phone appears corrupt pocket dialed his wife while she was asleep in California and left the link the voicemail a strange sounds screaming pains growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human sounds or their animal sounds or

H. B.\nAnd C. G. H. B. is not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states it's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases\nBut it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat are recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony\nAnd then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody on there that says stop it that's um that's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is and in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this\nIs on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened or college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend to his and says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing in his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies are bound and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched or by persons are known by things unknown almost like no one gigantic bird is whooping down and matching them up\nUm you know so many\n... agrees is calling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this earlier I heard\nJohn this YouTube say this is I don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic\nBecause I'm not giving you and your theories I'm giving you All Facts and\nThat's the way I Want people to understand this is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat there are patterns say and um this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um ah that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at triangles including one that's here in Nevada right\nUnfortunately [laughter] yeah how did you ever heard of that\nYes yeah there was a pretty famous a plane crash up in that area a Steve I'm trying to remember the name um bossy I think it is yeah they got a lot of attention a couple of years ago\nUm yeah and that but I Know that was\nThat they did a massive search for him and and there were some\nWe won't leave one warrior behind not on our website and\nFind out how you can do your part\nSigned W.

lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure uh December twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty\nOccurred on the island of mall if an island in Scotland fifty five years old a Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot [laughter] spit fires in the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force the hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island a mall and there was a grass airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water [noise]\nHe arrived at the hotel on December twenty on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the script and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named Felicity Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay out the tortures through he can fly inland\n[noise] so she exits the plane places the torches out in the field and he she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they can never see where the lights went\nWill make a long story short Gibbs didn't return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers the search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six it was about four months after it the disappearance gifts his body to found on the north pole\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near the airfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it\nNow if Gibbs it jumped from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane [noise] nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best every one could tell\nThe corners David the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia\nAnd I guess that he probably died two hours after takeoff well they examine his clothing and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there really how long have you been dead where was the plane\nAnd then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain when people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die\nObviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain it away and saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nHow would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would sit here\nDoesn't seem to\nWell one of the things is I look for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of clothes\nAnd the person left the house and it was Seventy degrees or yeah later that night to get down to fifty but the person left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone in there and up stack in this field\nThis has happened multiple times\nAlso I've had other cases where a parent says might be be couldn't take off their clothes so if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes\nSo the cases I Try to include tried I tried to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the boogie kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions deal\nHappens\nYou know in the alien abductions field I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous or that or there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes Ron backwards or a shoe is missing or um\nThey've got somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning I'm now there could be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople's clothing is found its kinda folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as if by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books\nWere special notes were made that the clothing and the body was in packet bleak clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower and they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they'd been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not weathered there it's not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where did they go\nWell the same thing applies to the water related cases when when the bodies of water it does certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair\nRink wing of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out corners of meat statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days for worthy wherever they bid for all this time\nAnd that's important about hind finding a body especially water because it shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or a harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it need something from 'em and and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just discarded or when they're not needed anymore um\nI mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it it's sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body that's not the case\nIf they are found there are some pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the sole\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that\nYeah I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence ... what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence it would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of of one of these um incidence underway\nWere ... when we first started this trip together years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right gotta be something mundane it may be some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about we've come a long ways\nAnd I think if you start shutting the door to early you can't see really what may be obvious years later and that's one of the reasons I been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know may be a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me I mean I thinking where we are today versus where I was six years ago that huge distance\nWe're talking with Dave ... missing for one one land air water in a moment I'm going to open up the phone lines and you can ask Dave a couple of questions yourself we'll be right back\nMainly\n'em and they tried calling the nine one one non emergency I'm very detailed search and rescue and they never called back um and another lady um they were and that generally now became flash it certainly coin [noise] um yeah and they they tracked it on their own they could give it and\nUm you know I I don't know it was three page on her cell phone and excuse me one of them didn't make any sense way off to the left or the or where you park your car it's not even with a trail is um\nAnyhow um I just kind of thinking you know I started what this could be and I said in the portals to another dimension\nYeah you know I've started what this could be and I was thinking maybe portals to another dimension um big foot big for my the guy was within his brother had seen big foot a couple of times up in that I'm ... I've seen a shift it's twenty five feet above me\nHe is also an underground secret naval base um they only ran stage enough I'm On the back side it is now in the gym creek I'm only twenty\nAnd I don't

things are the cell phone hanging I wrote a about a case in Michigan\nSeveral years ago and they track this guy's phone over this area and according to the paintings and according to where it hit he would've had to have crossed a road multiple multiple times\nIn this pattern that he was supposedly tracked him and there was never any evidence he was in any of these areas and he was found deceased\nIn an area probably where he should have been and where they were originally looking but it just like this lady said the kings didn't make any sense\nIt's probably more often than you are here and everyone kind of just ... off and says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe it's not that good there's some reason we're getting these paintings in these areas\nAnd it's disconcerting that they happen because and not only only throws off the search there's never an adequate explanation as to how it got their\nFirst time caller Brent in Redding, California Hi Brent welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you very much for taking my call what's on your mind\nTo questions for David so you've talked about how ah people when they have come back\nThey haven't remembered anything that happened to them so I wondered if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but there are somehow having their memory a race that also you've talked about the German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious to the parents to Germany if perhaps they're more common there\nSo\nGerman Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race or you have written about ... about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect and uh that's an obstacle especially with kids that's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep that memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that will of the claims that and is willing to go through a lot of butter hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taking their very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking bear or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people a reporter wall put it in the article you know that's

interesting things as far as cooking and it's been brought up to me before that there's some belief out there that special forces have that ability and the practice when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that the there is some kind of nanotechnology involved than any of these disappearances based on marks on the

sharing that with us\nWe're going west of the Rockies Roger in Bellevue, Washington Hi Roger\nAnd it's a thank you George a snap 'em I wanted to a related story to Mr polite as a about a missing people are in the Bellingham uh area of the Washington state\nUh that are over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body parts and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and ah [noise] and since the during that time period uh my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of happening in a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and we figured that uh you know that uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and ah and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out of a mixture of prices are being aware of this a phenomenon of uh\nOf defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized and newspapers and and over there you\nKnow what I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you know if you wanted to try to contact and we have a we have links on the coast to coast website his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a days I I Know he knows about the the the story because it was a widely publicized but your son\nUm what are the circumstances where did that happen and when\n[noise] okay uh if it happened in Bellingham in it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened a ... and this happened two years ago October uh he uh\nHe had left home and uh we'd believed that maybe they are made of\nHe had left home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been some friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into the vehicle and evidently it ran out of cash and a ... didn't have any money to get cash so he took up walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back and uh that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his tone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere and couldn't find his way out\nAnd uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row\nWith a with a law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones are I mean they covered ah area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed that period and ah we were just show\nA broken over that uh and uh\nAnd since then uh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talked to a few times to some of the people that actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws or the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh uh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so\nWow Dodger that reason why\nYeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David his brightest and she went to see what he thinks\nI I Would suggest you try that website or that okay good that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never going to get re and the fact that you just don't know it was just a is a brutal\nThank you Roger thanks for calling and we'll try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge I did a couple of season okay for two national parks a glacier in the valley in Alaska and one thing I Would say a\nSpecially looking at the rally the infrastructure of the park is very limited uh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a buff\nNo real hiking trail and if he'd go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be bad for hiking so\nI I Would say it and I would call late to slip glacier ah they really on the plate shows\nHow treacherous a trail ... for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trials that are like twenty miles trails\nFor like two three four miles so I I think a lot can go wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and cutting proceed\nAh that I don't know anything could happen with the wild animals from the one thing now I don't think\nAh what's happening as some sort of Charles Manson\nGroup that all looking to just five isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think that people go to those parks to like a just\nA pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker so\nI I I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening uh but\nUh I I think what David Sanger about the national parks is very little supervision people are are you know there are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was ...\nAnd one more thing on that is my ... theory is what you said about the birds are swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I said what is\nIt looked like something from Jurassic Park flight to wander effects or a moat idea after some sort of prehistoric bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory [noise]\nUm you know the idea that they're criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know they're criminals pretty much everywhere the humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who uh grow and grow weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if we're talking about people who banish I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances and there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around\nA ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people that are hiking with so\nIt's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain pretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David books but a appreciate that thought\nOh we're going to take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines or we'll get to as many of your calls as we can I noticed that a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um but I can understand how the elements can ah can sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the ah we're going to go to the break the ... take us into the break and we'll be right back\n\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the ... I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff for a very long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spend some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe and had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or release for the last fifty or so years\nSo there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags room rock like thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east to the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how're you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um this evening or if you guys were talking about a ... you were talking about this couldn't walk around\nRight and uh and I literally stood up and said that it and I pointed at the radio because I've read all the books I've read all of the four one one books I've read the scan walk ranch book and I've been following this thing for some time for several years\nOr ... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of uh disappearances\nA lot of disappearances happen on or near rich line and I just couldn't walk ranch that's on a ridge lie\nA let's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taking no one ever see them being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent ... knows whatever's somebody's on the property or on around ... is just\nTo me I'm just saying to me uh in my opinion I think that you know the the skin walk ranch uh is very close to uh the the phenomenon around and go for one one\nWell I you know I think there are some similarities in it than it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do it themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have been other here but not people you\nKnow there has not been any people missing but there's been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation to\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of a gouge marks on them other than scrapes with things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien would do when you read a function stories and things like that but that that doesn't fit but\nAs far as rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate a no one ever sees sees it uh that that to me is uh some good strong march there\nBy the way thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with is that a lot to chew on ... you calling in we're going to go to a wildcard line Mario in San Antonio Texas or he has a ... he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome Georgia and have a ticket for taking my call I Love your mind that you might experience\nA issue here at a park in San Antonio which they added another channel miles of bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd found is wooded area where even do was daylight at the time almost literally me and my wife were using all by slowing down to chart the course I was a little ahead over and uh you got to this one area where it got kind of dark even though it was daylight but it was so would it that it was\nThe sun shining through as much as I saw it kinda got caught in the dark in that area and when I stopped to see what my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was all on the stump they look more like a bird\nUp but uh you know you never know I mean it's kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall ... feet\nAnd just there and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she load and we've kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw it back there'll be flying away but the wingspan was so large that wasn't a\nIt was like a regular bird you know I mean we have dogs and I'm ... and all kinds of stuff but not in a park nearby but this was a real heavy area would it\nBetween parks where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is\nAnd so I just want to share my story 'cause I Know we didn't report it to the cops are any park rangers or anything but why don't we didn't have no evidence of Jewish fella hard to believe that a bird could be that did emerge to people just riding bikes than a a\n[noise] a lie down some kind of report about something that we just saw\nSo uh you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on the animal or it's\nAll you saw was kind of like a maybe something ... eyes kind of like blowing just like if you just see a beer in the dark Cold War or something like\nTyler glowing just like if you just see a deer in the dark Cold War or something like that you knew staring at you but you you could just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really tell exact details especially when there was this that and I I think the first thing you know I noticed was a sense that something was staring at me and that's why that's so it made me look\nAnd whatnot 'cause my wife and I'm looking at it and I look at that point so I so second she turned around and just try to fly away\nSo I couldn't really tell a bad like hands arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and do stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story nothing none of that's kinda creepy stuff for she ate a specific detail that you had on that a while that's quite

fishing lakes\n[noise] that's basically off of an old logging road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do in this logging road had been closed for a long time\nThey bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road and pile up a big mountain\nOf the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again you can kind of hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the coast range\nAnd it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down this trail and I ...

G. R. S. and you're listening to collect\n[noise]\nGood evening everyone there in the right place at the right time this was coast to coast am\nBlasting out of the Mojave Desert like usher Rocco blazing across the land slamming into your radio like us who were charged nanoparticle of obtaining\nReadings from the ... most outrageous city in the world the planetary capital of sun fun sins sex secrets my not so humble hometown Las Vegas in about my name is George nap you're Asian host\nDesignated driver of the airwaves and moderator up tonight's upcoming to ... conversation [noise]\nIf you recognize the name of my guests than I then I don't need to sell you on the idea that this program will grab your brain and your attention and the old both with an iron grip\nI think this marks the sixteenth time that David blight is and I have collaborated on coast to coast and there hasn't been a dull moment in any of those programs were exchanges\nTonight we will expand the boundaries of his missing for one one investigation\nA new book missing for one one law L. A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raise the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply banished to dip into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now he's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water\nAnd as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this\nOh so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve\nA David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence of cases these uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first\nBut worst mass murder incident in American history unfolded fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured all week leading up to this date that the town is remember those who died those who were wounded those who've struggled to deal with what they witness that night\nAt a town that prove to the world that it's much more than just an adult Disneyland or get away but it's a real community that pulls together when things get tough effect that seemed to surprised so many of the national news people I I remember watching them uh that week last year\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigator background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done\nAnd I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks singer restrictions and ah we talked about it and it had to be a semantic says she has three refiled and they came back an attorney called this time and said well why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that of the determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then he came back and he said well you don't have any of us and missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are that detective\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or acumen who've list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nI said no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well David you ought to just file a request and see how many rules of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but after it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status as an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me\nA couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify Lucian of such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lesser I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because they still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now\nWe will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards that every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they can hire an intern during the summer\nThere can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even responded wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated and many others after you nobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exists um you know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and uh so we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons\nBehind that are for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the profile points of the key\nYou have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the profile points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books the kinds of things that you look for\n[noise] for people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred and read a report start making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four or five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue they can't I Can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked at a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be and there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a vet reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person who was last seen they walk her foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest [noise]\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times the time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world to Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but ... much more of a role as I have explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them that point of separation something happens\nAnd that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that and interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report ... that's when it happens\nAlmost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah [noise] equipment malfunction and this is it this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a medical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical clustering that I figured out after I started putting pins in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this\nSame sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women is a four to one ratio\nCorrect\nI any idea why why so many more men than women may be more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David Blaine is about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck at the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\n\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want [noise] there's a case from eighty six\nI'm an error the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspects there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand\nIn law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nThat these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it\nBut there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public upon the crust Colorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything\nUm so the first thing is you've got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened and\nLike to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's the superficial job of collecting information because it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas ever been a couple that you and I've talked about before\nIt's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there is a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specific sure the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further are you you defer to them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to tell the story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nYou know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have been a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it I Can't explain it\nAnd every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports\nWhen the sheriff's office helped on a search and they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that\nBut then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete\nCame from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle [noise] she liked to go to this a location a call ... ... per ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there on August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\n[noise] round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scrambled to the top [noise]\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike\nAnd the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here at fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she pulled her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he went he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two\nWell the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her [noise]\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at them out and about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually called the snow homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked hundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual the cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because\nYou're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance but his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and search and day and night ... and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kind of gave him this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports\nOtherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before that a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do not Syria you really want to give it a big push [noise]\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports\nAnd they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do [noise] you don't go to the local news media and you'll understand this church is the local news media has to deal with\nThe sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but the national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up\nThen you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office and demand that they get more assistance and more help for you\nYou stay there until they realize you're going to be a thorn in their side so that they get you more help that's kind of the reality of it\nIt's sad but it's true and there were dog used in this one as well yeah there were multiple multiple times", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "01"}
