of the of washed up these you know\nMysterious masses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and then it also Spring Hill jak fighting up there but as I was up there I came across um of a place called lake crushed and\nUm and it's this little you know from land is it's beautiful it's just you know it just ... and everything and it turns out that there there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot a metal sculpture\nThing this thing as you enter the town in the town of the population is like three or four or something [laughter]\nI went to the car I'm like I put on the Braves I gotta I I Can't pass a lake monitor come on cry and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right that's right I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff\nOkay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I I Googled that ... found your article that you've written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course\nBut you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too but I saw this great article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the guy you know and so it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody\nWho was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins of the Halloween\n... I I I wanted the two hundred years from now when people were researching the orders is will if when they're going to come up\nWith this conversation I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it will be like that on\nOne of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays mean your Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamental if the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that because they think it's really to be called which not\nBut it's it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's where I really love Halloween is it's\nIt's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history um basically\nPossibly candy as a fascinating history I'm so basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of full Couric these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences the coming over time\nBut basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much um infringe about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the film\n... records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest and it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sauces\nAnd it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something after but to them it was very it was ... an analyst\nPoint of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like\nYes there was a time to you know to a store grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's with especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you on the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would ah would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world are porous\nUm the other barrier between them but also\nI'm In a leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time it's porous and so what you find is that a pool would later become Halloween\nI'm there would be a it'll be basically a time when it would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but it's also that the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that the that ah ah for example a woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future um and there would be the prophecy and often times the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so it was it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night\nOr for example they would be would a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see\nTheir future husbands reflection [noise] um and so all these sorts of another one example was a bombing for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie appealed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night actually I Do I Do it at midnight right\nOn that willfully night that's right will swing and well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you\nKnow I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it is fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think this fall whether I think an orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins and\nAnd the theory Feinstein saying that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have in a band rapper with us\nHe is an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as coast folks here that want to learn everything\nUm but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's Willis we hang in there you don't know what you might hear\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lane and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nNormal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nYou know the the any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mass can we make make something out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wasn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing are getting sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the early\nA Celtic version of it which were very Anna mystic and\nAnd again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise] um but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day\nWhich was a to honor that the church a church members who have gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nHe um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all saints day in office all day\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that sort of transformed little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know could we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is the uh it believe that a drink so I went to drew leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds\nAnd England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween preparing for the dead and this again the ties back into all sold day because the idea was that um that on that day\nAh the sole weren't purgatory you know there were there were basically trapped between heaven and hell they need to be prayer praying for\nA and so the the wealthier members of the communities would basically a higher out there were ... they were subcontracted prayers if you will\nTo these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals are going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would lead or translate into uh the\nThe the the uh the public and I'm looking\nAt a candle Atlanta the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they were these members go out to house or you know yes will pray for if you're a member of your family who's a who's passed on um you know with the ... you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to\nThink of this light as the sole Bush wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America um\nThe tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nRead one that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're if they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on [laughter] ... cells and Munch on little olive oil salt pepper um so where do you think candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the fifties like you were talking about [noise]\nYeah well I mean if it ... it was interesting 'cause it 'cause they're getting the ... it's sort of things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again there was the ... the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the ... during this time\nOf the the jitters had pretty strict social roles and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would praying away and with fully think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of\nThe time who knows 'cause that's what they did a but\nThat that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house in the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era so that was typically sort of a young man's usually a mixture of this\nYoung man's project into the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the process of those sorts of things so so you know by\nThe ritual in terms of you know the process of those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory that's that's a little a little a little outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treats or and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid a not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even like it was like some really tart apple like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that and like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together too because they were there were years where you get science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the green in which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get in a handful\nYou're the only perimeter marathon bars I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're great harm those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's a horrible ...\nYou got a full on you gotta so long as you can our place I Wish I had been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those are nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time\nBut we were there was like one house and always had homemade popcorn ball they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people and then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house\nThat there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like ... you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three answers the the uh the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the yeah and the fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about\nA friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at at the cases where somebody has actually painted these sorts of things um if it happens very rarely there there was one case there but he points to it was a case of\nA man and wrong wrong cargo Brian uh who killed is owned by Lee things ... cyanide Nineteen Seventy four of 'em but but but that that wasn't a stranger that

had with a\nNever on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on the air now are\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nUm houses down the street that nobody ... the abandoned homes or\nA ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you in Britain quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I despise rainy and that's why I like to talk\nFor a social life I'll just say that all I Do like\nYour let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences of now I find I found it interesting that you had said to me\nThat people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would get ... why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe\nCall upon your family members somebody you know and that's true why do you now know\nThat was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating go swimming though is is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact\nThe good um ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know go hunters and all that and what you find is that the\nThe idea that you know people have been talking with a dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lady Macbeth I mean banquet so there's\nThere's there there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history but you know typically\nGo or or if it's typically if you if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to ... your your\nYour great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently hum and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a year the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location\nAnd talk to some random\nSpirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's fast that you you know you go back and look at the\nThe the ... that were held in in the Victorian era offered an upper class uh places and they would have you know a ladies they they've Crumpet the tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou would have the spiritual era [noise] um and you have people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is to you know came to the states and Medicaid Maggie Fox\nAnd and and they're you know their their stuff and so and then your hair your pride in his researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with goes\nAll through white noise improve base your broken radio that switches channels and then you fast forward to\nTo the modern day goes on her with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough spooky enough or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit because um it's it's scary when you get somebody talking\nSpirit because um it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they poke intense and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if it's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house eyes last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer ... or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and James is like you know folks quick provoking clip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they're WhatsApp I tell you you're not doing yourself and he favors thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is that All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n[noise] ... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to it and more science based or someone's have skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAny we're [laughter] you sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious found or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what\nWhat exactly is is is going on there and the question is\nCan we tested it'd repeatable right it\nIs it is found that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and crazy t._v. reality you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed\nOut I was a lot of them you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of go because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do with and do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see is the center's on TV and and not actually just\nAcross the board is is are you surprised even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... EMS or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling\nThe environment and looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around a little ... things and then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them\nAnd they try and look for anything we're all look at this it is three oh eight PM am you know we saw this thing and the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you\nTalk to an eyewitness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are\nYou need to investigate those particular claims and and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part part part of the problem here is that\nIs that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that\nProblem is that that in almost all cases they don't they don't have a good grasp of of of ah of\nThe amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred going to a location maybe there's team of them\nAnd they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours wherever else and then they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um\nParanormal abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd you whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is reading is you get over that six hours that there could be normal variation that you want to do this you know only happens once a week or something\nIt's his Benjamin Radford that we're talking we're learning about how he is describing investigating guess his theory I said look we've got more of that coming up stay with us because the hand celebrating Willis we [noise]\nAnd L. V. I. T.\nTwelve thirty Jay Z are at the river\n\n\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator and mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating does and it it's um it's very interesting book it\nTalks about ah well let's let's bring him back on year then we were talking about how you investigate and how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I'm Wondering here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is talk and you know some ... there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures impossibly something and I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what his photo shop what is not a photo shop what might just be a glitch\n... might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and\nDon how the analyzing\nOf photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that that's a good question and I have to say that that um you know I I've I've probably looked at a two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people have sent me I'm I'm a same with the troops macabre I'm the I'm the default recipient of\nOf cheaper carpet photos nearly mangy dogs in Texas but I I have to explain that to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I've rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the goes photos of them sent our our ... by sincere people who just photographed something weird and they yeah\nThey're not lying there not a hoax who met not try pulling over on me they're like hey can I follow them they're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise] um and so you know I I go into each case um you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can\nAnd so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you are I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\n[laughter] researchers go sort of much why not\nBecause I haven't trademark Willis lean and got north and south [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I ask us\nFor no but it's um so so there's a couple of things one of them is the is I went one possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um\nOne case that I'm known for which the Santa Fe courthouse coast case happened about or no maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing orb thing that the cross this this real and camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're probably that would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy on the courthouse cameras though the likelihood of this being a hoax was dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to the story a it was made national news and people who are we all this weird thing of law\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be um and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could it be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there some I mean so\nYou just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I tried to list those and I tried to rank them terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\nHum and you just basically go down the list and\nAnd that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the seaport and uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell they came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be\nI could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back and different state but I said you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there\nGo back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph at the same place ideally at the same time a day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for an ... an image of a face or something\nI see cell and I get that I get that and you know I guess that\nThat thing whatever that might be is just there like you said and it might be people might think well I'll give you another example of what\nI was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's some one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where\nYou know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I was sent us an example this a couple of months back and said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird go the image or just behind her left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who were you were nearby and no one's looking at this you know\nI mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking at this strange image to their left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't feed at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI Gotcha I Gotcha hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um they just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is the way this shadow in and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that\nThat's I mean it just looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame at this place was hunting for sure that you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know of ...\nFor example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and and they they brought in all this\nAll these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know\nProbably Seventy thousand dollars of all the gear and it was all set up when the cameras on lights are all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we're on camera I mean this wasn't like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with were finished\nShooting or going back to hotel I said I said why do you think why do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of ghost or I mean even to this day and again this was you know six seven years ago said you know even\nThe the evidence doesn't seem to be getting a better it's all these blurry or business not and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost\nAnd I said yeah but if that's true if you believe that then why why ...\nWhy did you bring in Seventy thousand dollars [laughter] and yesterday and I said I got to be mean here but it's\nLike you're on one hand you're telling me that that are well we can't really detect goes with all the gear or ... why do you have all this gear and he he didn't really have an answer so you know one thing to keep in mind here is that\nIf you have Medicare Dr ... can management services and get the connecting care you need\nMore information\nIn Medicare ... for chronic heritage you paid for by

deep research I did actually said to me said if you lived in this village fifty years we wouldn't even consider the yellow tool\nIt's [laughter] it's crazy you know so so a lot of the outsiders I mean they may read about\nThese things I mean I'm In the Nineteen seventies\nHi this is I mean they may read about these things I mean I'm In the Nineteen seventies where I mean we've come to that now
