important for so many people to understand\nA bomb let's start let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes for Ralph was a vibrant young man with no\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree empty program were children graduate in six years with a BA in an empty [noise]\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City it was administered very controversial drug by the name of ... or ... G. L. A. and the generic version of it at ...\nThis is a black box drug\nThat was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning and from the moment that drug was injected within days\nRalph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point Ralph took his life\n[noise] over the course of a early twenties Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis\nAnd he made three attempts on his life to take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm it on his last attempt he was successful and um [noise] I did hold his hand and was there as he passed away\nHow old was he Johnson he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful but on the last attempt a he used a gun\nAnd at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marketing of the year but the text came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we are going to talk about tonight these synchronous cities that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in sync\nAnd for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was a it was a shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... it it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your child before before you go and I could only see what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name ... and then twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] well I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax and as I began to stare at it again and again\nIt occurred to me I Love and eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nI Want to tell our audience does a little sacred a city here when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now he had mentioned that you know his his son Rolf\nA was a you know just a delightful young guy and uh he's is you use the name Gabriel of course uh you took that name as well did you not\nI did ... middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they Eunice and no one is in doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um has brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was Gabriel and uh uh he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that ...\nWas born in these weird synchronous and if you started coming up all over again and Jonathan's ice just opened up in in everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person in in my personal life in my profession and Avi aiding [noise] and\nWith the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute\nThere's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study [noise] ah I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world\nAnd I do believe that the in finance is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not the St life on earth for him have seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will\nDoes not stop\nAnd that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say it it must be in a very strange way of\nCourse to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere [noise] ah in trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent\nUh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday which is an automatic watch okay and I've been wearing it for the better course of a year and a half [noise]\nI've not touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago I woke up I put on the watch I got my car I went to work and my watch was twenty two minutes by all\nHad to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men\nAnd do you get behind the car and you look at a license plate and you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences [laughter] so I really created a word for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as it on a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number just two twenty two\nJeeze random they just give it to correct you you didn't request it [noise]\nBut I don't think it's

rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better [noise] one of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite\nAnd in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability [noise] but I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for\nThe anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that\nI didn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nJonathan culturally then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me and a very strange stare and said I'll\nJust tell them Ralph set it fall\nAnd I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name\nHe said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head [laughter]\nI Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[laughter] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nIs against timing and secretive city again and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I ... moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back but the light switch back down put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off\nAnd at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\n[laughter] was the point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault him I\nHave struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was ... subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student\nOr frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most on us um you know likeable young man you could you could think of\nNow that do go to the hospital for food poisoning and that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay out of all they take some stuff uh you know they're going to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the\nI I think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood coming out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got\nAnd they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call\n[noise] well I got the call after the medication had been given to them about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for you Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question a story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I ... I Hope it's relevant to a distinction in cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at um it started with my son\nWho incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we could look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born in from their synchronous cities just\nRoll in um um we were both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two he was nine fourteen sixty eight and every number we have to do it this\nIs a night at nine I mean ... of fourteen or a seven where it's divisible by seven\nYeah I'm sure you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well oh you're the first thing was we noticed my initial PR his therapy um his mom name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don ... his\nAdoptive parents are exactly the same age as my parents to the year and a month July Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\nShe penny let me ask you if I can why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on the sixteenth birthday\nHuh OK okay\nUh it was it was better for him\nAnd me I understand that happened that way and I mean it was it was excruciating let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one of the same kind of these out of\nTwenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each\nOther and as for me is is he still with us\nOh absolutely OK yeah he he lived with\nMe for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah and um we were both born on air force bases hey it didn't this hatred that cities and their\nBeyond coincidence essentially when ours was done where like astrological star twins\nIt's uncanny in what again John what you call coincidence\nI call them coincide and says I I Believe that we all have these we just have to tune ourselves into them\nNo question about reality now you know there are certain things I don't believe in coincidence is either I think the steps in and things have a purpose and the reason\nA sure sometimes there's luck and strange occurrences but I think by and large there are no coincidence is is that all ... what do you think about randomness\n[noise] I don't feel things are random I feel that there is in order to the happenings I may not understand the order but I think that that there is in order to the happenings\nDad jokes [noise] to take a moment to make them on there\nYou just eat and he's going to fatherhood ... rocky by the U.S department of health services and the ...\n[noise] also alarmed lowering drug prices and then we have friends who is the New York city police department as a reporter to unattended packages at the time Warner center was a false alarm correspondent ... in the building Thursday night when it was back\nYour way there were two small boxes found on the third floor of the malls they couldn't account for them nobody knew exactly what they were doing there so out of an abundance of caution big cleared out the mole within minutes NYPD have\nSwarmed them all they brought in bomb sniffing dogs they brought in the bombs flawed they took all the the bomb gear obscene to them all move everybody off the top floors down below and then was able to clear Lee is a very quick Saudi Arabia\nNow citing evidence showing that the killing of journalist junk I'm sure she was premeditated actually changing the story again so the prosecutor say evidence gathered by Turkish investigators show the slang words planned contradicting an earlier Saudi assertion that rogue officials from the kingdom killed them by mistake in the anthem boot consulate\nOn federal government is looking to save as much as Seventeen billion dollars over the next five years by forcing drug makers to take less for Medicare's prescription programmed\nPresident denouncing the new rule at the department of health and Human Services one that could lower prescription costs for seniors where at least ...

that are this far away all sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly round the sky the fact that they're all off in this one direction\nCan only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbed and their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headline in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of those smaller objects that being swept off my whatever the massive look called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I

of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are fees wandering planets rope planets and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that plant nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood\nAnd then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out\nUsually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one and in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge\nBut if you could have gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could have been completely injected from our solar system in which case it would just be wandering through space\nAnd so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it when people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy\nTheory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why some the masses like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like number I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret and\nIt would've been visible to every backyard astronomer with the whole scope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for the past fifty years\nIf all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even\nTen times the mass of our earth where even out past Pluto out in the ... rebelled what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbations in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment and the planets that we know of but nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets\nAnd you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has\nA tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around in his worried the Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us planet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter's took its effect it's really minimal\nOne effect that it does have is that over four billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or do you have to wait to do papers or just\nThe way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data\nIt'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so if we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month\nOr two of collecting those data and then to that point we'll announce the existence as soon as we can confirm it\nWe will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away so we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] so January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIs possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it will take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat they're you know habit Oregon right from the man is discovered this uh in terms of those ...\nNations of the other half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevailed in the ... cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing this research project with these scientists is that I\nHad no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive that we're\nTrying to move in to our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the sun and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and you're on a star because Pluto or been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing that could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity in math and I it\nIt would have an impact on every single thing and that's\nThat's the way I Would have loved those Zacharias itching to done alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a\nFace to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat ... even if\nShe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be a massive plan it but when you read like say about the ... through scholar and ... that translation that we're a card\nGames Don and you look at the carvings one thing that always it's\nConfusing to me is talking about a Trump planet but in the can of form or Lebanon guy\nTo hold on right there and then let's come back we'll look finished that up in conversations with [noise]\nEight hundred sixty three forty five forty six eight hundred sixty three forty five forty six\nTwelve thirty the river and you're listening to go\n\nThen we'll get back to coast to coast George knowing what you were back in the open house story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nYeah you know I was Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide\nBlankets around the earth and at the United nations\nMany countries especially those worried about being islands and which sea level rise could flood and displaced populations they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the eye PCC\nAnd the objective was\nTo provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis to help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy by twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change many small island nation\nWere so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels\nThat the ICC PCC committed to doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientists\nFrom forty countries\nThe question was hit humans to restrict global warming to two degrees Celsius\nOr one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels\nThe October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit should be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty\nThat's the only a decade from now\nBecause if we don't if I planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius scientists warn that will be a catastrophe of math die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs\nAnd if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires weather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food in freshwater\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island and coasts populations to move\nBut to where\nThe twenty Eighteen IPC report said the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace\nAs much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal\nIt as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author or the IPC the report says quote this kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington which seems to pretend\nThat this climate change threat does not exist but this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon\nAs recently as three years ago in twenty Fifteen ... he is professor corrosion down\nHe ADD professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be fine pot nation in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report says countries want to the United nations to investigate lower woman target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also ... and the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lawyer in countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population very close to sea level Nigeria has huge population Roger street level but you know sodas most of the world and the United states also has an enormous populations right at the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's one of the nation of rising sea levels and melting ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the waiters can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels we saw a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already\nHaving to be evacuated and moved to higher ground so it's not so much the north slope but this house in the west coast\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe a combination of federal and state governments\nMoving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground\nAnd use that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere's not been so much\nEvacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding FM sooner now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to have to be evacuation in the next couple of decades of at least some places there's an island doesn't have to pick for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia more than half of it was already going\nLead seen the water come up through the drains skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding there was very rare it's become so commonplace that government's just put a marker so that motorist can see how deep the flooding is is so routine and Florida has been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state as ...\nSome of the worst flooding of street in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both to Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade to cope and dump more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models and then watch the models\nHas often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the fall of the ice and the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models project to\nYes the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen in that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWe've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating so that is definitely a blurry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized\nBased on\nSay melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating but that low you know when we were we because the\nWarming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty eight teen what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions and receipt flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd well even the heat extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat wave that killed thousands of people that kind of thing that would have been you know maybe every fifty years or so that will start to become more and more frequent and it'll\nBegin to happen maybe every decade or so where places like Phoenix will fill hit extreme heat for Phoenix who even the temperatures in a hot place they will go up and become even hotter\nAnd teach children and adolescents about the

fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching me with one finger and it just freaks me out and that doesn't mean\nI remember the environment being very luminous very white almost to where he was going to end your eyes that I remember this being issued a strange thing

his military background we drive included at the end of my earth filed news report tonight\nHis email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in titled quote\nThe experience that made me a believer that we are not alone and it began Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now\nBut at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five or Nineteen sixty six I within my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to sleep\nHere now from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell his own voice was done to him as a child and hot it tends to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived and they know Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend she waited two bedroom apartment my mother had two children and my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment in its two levels\nYou have to go up the stairs we get to their home and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brothers and two other kids and I woke up in the middle of night a trouble going back to sleep but not just in the dark\nCome and go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet bothers yearly cars so I knew it was very late at night 'cause I didn't hear your car goes by so I'm looking around\nIt was very late at night 'cause I didn't hear your cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up just look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really not actually but a grassy field in between the park which\nIs how I look up and I see a light up when I Lived in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at 'cause it was the only thing in the sky\nI notice something was coming down and by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was or\nWhat I noticed about that was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they have the glow sticks to me on green glow sticks right\nIt look like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all it was they cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been if it were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed that word it to light met in the middle a white lie in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in the fall white began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see food it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood boom so pretty and it's like you're looking at a seafood for long\nAnd what are you seeing what I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall white part wearing like down and he's looking up\nIs just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what\nAre you looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look at that that's a purchase and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from this is the\nOnly reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out this grieving go down there you have a lot we've gone to the beach\nYou [laughter] I didn't know what I was like man I wanted to go but bombs going to be do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand\nIt as a kid with significance for this\nOkay this is very close to you as you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time this was the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man this person looks like God\nAnd then I thought I'm not going to say that unless he actually tell you need a ride and then I'll go out man be sure looks like the guy the pitcher at church describe everything\nThe galley was wearing white when you're looking at this fall white I notice it was bright or brighter colors and the white light you can tell the difference between fall white and black and white I can clearly see that the gal was white ...\nVery bright white he was looking up and he was card cages and he had a brunette hair and it came down to I'd say\nHis shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWhat his hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say we're straight dislike you see when you see these motion pictures of Jesus of ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color in his eyes\nYou know I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd one was the shape of the down\nFrom what I could see it looked like it pulled over his head but all look like one ... piece and it went all the way down to is that you\nCould you see his feet in this syrup goal\nCraft no I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his seat\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was the end it it was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole atmosphere is kind of strange because I could see you know made it but I could look in the green part is the part that do these on the up a shot\nSince I'm twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window you are able to look through the surface of the white side of this fear goal or or craft and see the man inside the white side\nYes but you could not see into the lime green and you could see past\nThe line and the white yes and the fact that he blocked out\nThe apartment buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that even though you're very strange to you then you had to have been solid matter or at least blocking some time to have blocked out the buildings that were behind it\nYes it is the is floating down is that if you will blow up a blow and toss it in the air that's about the speech is the what's coming down and I was thinking that it was going to like\nI Need to get down here see asked this person's some questions you know but ah as it got toward the ground I watched it go on to the ground like it was it even they're\n...\nHas a positive impact\nAnd they'd all\nTo you can join

minute\nThere's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study a I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world\nAnd I do believe that the infant it's is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does she want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not seized\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop and that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say it it must be in a very strange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues\nThat he's out there somewhere ah in trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday which is an automatic\nWatch okay and I've been wearing it for the better of course of a year and a half [noise]\nI've not touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago I woke up I put on the watch I got my car I went to work and my watch was twenty two minutes by all I had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men\nAnd do you get behind the car and you look in a license plate didn't you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a work for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as on a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nJeeze random they just give it to correct you didn't request it [noise]\nBut I don't think it's random I'm I have removed random from my thought\nPrime right yeah I mean there might be random on the hotels side but somebody else's directing this\nThat the stock patterns Jonathan stay with us we're going to come back in the moment and talk more about these strange synchronous

George George with you get your coals Jonathan Gabriel rescue is with us again his website in the need to twenty two dot com linked up at ... dot com we're talking about his latest work called and said you know twenty two about the life with his son ... cities that occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite\nAnd in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability [noise] but I think of the brain as the infinite zone\nAnd I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone\nWhere each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat'd you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that\nI didn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nTrying to think culturally then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the ... driver situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a\nProblem with it tell anybody you want and he looked at me in a very strange stare and said I'll just tell them Ralph set it off\nAnd I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday\nI went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[laughter] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nOr gets timing and secretive city again and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and\nI turned off the lights and I was leaving the house was empty and the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me occurring the lights back\nBut the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\n[laughter] which is the point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't I don't fault him I have struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizens\nWell they're they're protected by the federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was ... subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student\nOr frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most on us um you know likeable young man you could you could think of\nNothing to do go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay out of all they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital I\nI think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood was out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call\nThe emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call [noise] well\nI got the call after the medication I had been given to them about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for you Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question a story Hi Patty\nI uh I I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we can look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born in from their synchronous cities just roll in um\nUm we were both born nine fourteen which were nine fourteen fifty two he was nine fourteen sixty eight and every number we have to do it this\nIs a night at nine I mean scares me and a fourteen or a seven or its divisible by seven\nYeah I'm sure you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well oh you're the first thing was we noticed my initial ... P. R. R. P. um his mom's name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don ... its\nAdoptive parents are exactly the same age as my parents to the year and a month July Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\n... pending let me ask you if I can why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on the sixteenth birthday\nHuh OK okay I\nIt was it was better for him\nAnd me I understand that happened that way and I mean it was it was excruciating let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one in synchronous he's out of twenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each\nOther and as for me is is he still with us\nOh absolutely OK yeah he he lived with\nMe for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah and um we were both born on air force bases hey it didn't this hatred that cities and their\nBeyond coincidence el ... when ours was done we're like astrological star twins\nIt's uncanny in winter again John what you call coincidence\nI call them coincide and says I I Believe that we all have these we just have to tune ourselves into them\nNo question that reality now you know there are certain things I don't believe in coincidence is either I think the steps in and things have a purpose in a reason a sure sometimes there's luck and strange occurrences but I think by and large there are no coincidence is at all\nWhat do you think about randomness\n[noise] I don't feel things are random I feel that there is in order to the happenings I may not understand the order but I think that that there is an order to the happenings", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "26"}
