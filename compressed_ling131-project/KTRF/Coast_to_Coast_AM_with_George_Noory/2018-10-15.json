welcome to everyone listening all around the world all across the United states [noise]\nForget what do you live [noise]\nFrom the great pyramid the headquarters which night as the coast to coast AM Studios right here in Los Angeles California standing and on this beautiful Sunday evening I Am your host Jimmy church at night like gas is my new save\nSaturday every body let's get started I listen to every body watch [noise] the gift that keeps on giving that special\nOne that you don't put in a drawer and forget about no it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that\nFor that singular presence that's all wrapped up in a boat for this and every one of the great pyramid you\n\nDon't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving\nThe great pyramid it's forty two stories tall it's it's over Thirteen acres sickly libel rock climbing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for\nOr to south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain has pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid any ships in history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I highly ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight\nTravelers explorers they would travel to Cairo they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes we don't know you know but it's really big [laughter]\nThat's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred years to figure out the language\nAnd you would think that with all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone some time somewhere would have shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it\nBut it never happened and although today we know about the Rosetta Stone and the quest to the code everything\nThe great and eat eat Egypt shunned amnesia\nStory um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up and and so I started reading a little bit more and ah and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a Udall communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um few a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am\nScroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first and so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the ... and ... at least that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got too involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to Orion mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah built the pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt stars for why and\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes belief that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three it was you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue as probably look at the statue of humans you know looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I'm at so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol\nOf a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue um I notice it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is amazing ... by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dreams the law which is you know in front of the cause of the ... between the positive things and\nIt was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was this things then it ... it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the lying is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shocking we were sitting\nAt breakfast and I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nSo compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you\nKnow why is it that the mortgage applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grapes banks\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles but is not documented the anywhere in\nEgypt shouldn't history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything that he loved to\nGo and tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting and sees and everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except for the great strengths and the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know you want to answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found a record store the records were destroyed um but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with his famous you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nIn scripture that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think\nI think we found something that leads to things um [noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are ... when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool and from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know ... was\nAlive and if you walk into that too there's actually a reference to the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of its called uh the whole rise of coup food\nAnd next to it it's the um the you know the the country is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they call that cover his grade and coup was driven was called to Hawaii with Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the show and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou ... yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built it or the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose\nAnd that is very computer all\nThe way to have auditors um you know the ... century but to see you know this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to blocks but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account\nHow it was done but uh it's got to\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things and we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all\nBut yes that was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century\nThat may be tougher laws to force who is the author of to dream so between the cause of the things that he is the one who built it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small reference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law and the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name Cooper was the\nEgyptian name it's the same person so that the mentors the law says very unequivocally would ... came to the pot told his things already existed in fact it was broken he repair that\nAnd then he built his pyramid\nThat was the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast am ... church or ... minute ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nWind up more emotionally loaded on Tuesday in\n[noise]\n\nOr ... minute said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory Stella and the dream still or right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward\nAnd end the dreams della a top most for says mentions and in illustrates two things is there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks well there's two things is there I Know there Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second thing being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question I'm Out of it so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting\nThe seconds things uh as the celestial springs in other words the constellation Leo [noise] but uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's ... it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end\nBy as things and these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable so so the answer to this question specifically of course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things are on the other side of the Nile but it's there are things buried under the sense that say west of a conference here that it's possible\nThe\nTeam and tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this things but builds the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course Egypt colleges most causes do not accept the inventories de la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shock and I recently published a paper where we counter this argument's so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so what's your question um\nThey're the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to me it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of the style of a is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building as mentioned and the the verb that that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the\nYou know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the red sea you know they are saying well you okay this is the powers talks about tour store and being ... a ... a\nA but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who I mean it was a it means they interview you within the other day he made a great point you said that\nUh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield and so that means that if you ship tour I to be that that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter or\nAs you went up the courses and then you're back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind\nAbout it and there was a quite a bit of relatives are you uh you know pyramids that coup was dealing with uh also one of the games are plateau right could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\n... are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson 'em\nAnd hit Knutson a this was also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is will the new to it so she was supposedly is queen and uh he built a pyramid for her the southern most of the three ah off the tree a queen permits federal on an empty field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the mentors though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to spell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we've we think the poop shows that she was a print says so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or a ...\nAnd then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old kingdom story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the chance or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids are crumbling they don't even looked like they were built by the same engineers or by the same hand with the same care flight and those would be more simple to build\nAnd you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even you know more complex yeah they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones and so what we're seeing a A R is the left over\nUm I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to\nUh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the\nWorkman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and the and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holes you didn't have to you know like a\nA ... the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kinda like the pyramid is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nAnd that's also what I wanted to do I want to really get some information out of the pyramid without you know uh putting my hand on

Kathy\nYou like that my news you liked that area [laughter] okay I\nAm a day or I always love hearing is that all that you may have more do you play so great for me to keep it up now\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short green quick about their armored Tyler just at the end\nOf the first question\nThey asked her is credited with Jimmy\n... uh the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is\nAll Howard graphics around go back ... in Egypt in that area of the world the same hieroglyphics that are found and the pyramids of Mexico central and South America\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff cliff inscriptions and go back like that that is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking is are the ... that are written all the ... and ... and so forth and go backwards at the all the same I regret that are found on the air is in Mexico and central and South America oh okay\nI understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipic inscriptions\nIn decades heavy in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name on it but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at going back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they in the same I don't know there is an H M the belt that looks very similar to the age blocks in ... who are are they related I don't know\nRight there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby [noise]\nAre they are they representing the zodiac ah that were in then Darrow and throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but I'm going back lead happy being that old\nCertainly is indicating that they were the first Senate does the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the I called up to ... age on the bells and whether it looks like but does that age that age is repeated it\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question that they ask and go back to ... um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nWill do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go back to happy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared and I'll mention it later on in the show thank you bury\nNo problem thanks for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this uh are completely jammed up let's get in one more call on all of them but yeah let's let's go to\nThis is a let's go to let's go to my dad in New York my ad Europe next\nMorning ... and ... [noise] I Do find the ... I like now if he looked at any of that ... highly highly on me and I [noise] um\nSet up the highway of any age and I and I'm off I I think that might be the one that deals with the founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that they take a lot and\nThe second part and I live over there and whether he and and and the hobbit and and shot ... had hit it some of the um\nThe African and African American ballet who study the net net net to add a name on the language which is still out of that that that to a phrase\nItself of which didn't say quit\nAnd whether he looked at people who call themselves a candidate for and that in the kitchen you know before they get Greeks came in and say they're going to have a hippie Kennett colic his cabinet is where we got word from but can they say and also\nUm [noise] the what you call me was that what what they think we Scott came up with and to me [noise] what if\nI were to get rid of it not what it is and the African American outlets that I'm thinking that they call it a little odd that arise showed a ton will oh God oh fat if you follow them a ... and I'll listen off the air\nThank you bye ad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around on the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the ... actually in my book um because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this is an ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long\nAh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe the tapes to the middle kingdom and and reaches back are most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally\nWas a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture and that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two um UGA\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie the other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt a ... probably from Bhutto\nAnd brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably as opposed to any uh with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a fixture oh so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adapting uh the analogy of chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes ... issue I think she mentioned it stinks so uh my uh we we think this thinks was making before uh before Crawford game I think there was a we would think it was the lioness and her name was made eat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast a damn it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or get my news save da de his paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\n[noise]\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to ... am dot com\n[noise] to me\nYou\nKnow [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nLearned for yourself fly all the ... member one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive played Arizona State university for more information about on the one line tax live ... that's how the two three five five wind sapping\nWell thirty AM and you're listening to coast it goes [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess tonight and Manu save Saturday\nWe're talking about the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid but his formula in his white paper they published last week on how to locate them and I want to say really quick minute\nThat Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a Jay ... radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinate and that does coordinate point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to habit and\nHaven't yes\nUm I haven't the right to propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where\nThe math of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is look he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah that the coordinates that Alan just discovered a a fall right next to the ...\nWhich is next for the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd his you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with a Shakespeare and his work ... work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it is absolutely incredible and we'll have among coast next month\nOkay so now that the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody into the the ... report PDF\nThe topics have you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBut right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident Rudolph cups or break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring the ah found is when you get to guns and brings door\nJust before the the the floor off of the of the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he's interpret one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space that allows that forward to cave in slightly for that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing\nThere is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth um and and then then let's go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been detected by me on again\nNow the row let's let's let's get to this first second and the\nUh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft um and uh it is going up words every body of one of seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just used the illustration is is an old ... I'm so that that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basic the establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ring in other words there is a space\nAt designed space not thought you know an accidental space and designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yeah we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which uh did help them find this cavity there's new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being place I'm at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside\nAt this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes and I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed as the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what to move on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when a cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them yuan has created enemy on is a negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier\nOr didn't electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light is lifetime is just over two seconds I'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray to pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it show and then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yuan will travel more rapidly through open air then you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors plays in the grand gallery\nCould they be used to find the\nThe chambers that you were proposing and in the upper half of the pyramid\nHere it is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact tool and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big voice is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that there could be some some of the lower once maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nUm let's say seven twenty fifth and sixth twenty fifth it's possible that if there is a\nA as if there's a space on the northern side on the northern half of the pyramid that it will get picked up by the scan um it's also possible they put the deck to place in places that we don't know for example the you know the uh the chamber's above the king chamber\nYeah and we would never find out about that nobody gets to go up there\nWhich one is your favorite memories\nTough question\nWell [noise] there's files pressure on Saudi Arabia I'm only a princess after weeks of speculation other search for a number of solution the company that once dominated the American retail landscape is filed for bankruptcy protection to cast and bum report\nThis was not at all unexpected years holding company was supposed to make one hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment today many Wall Street analysts believe that the company wouldn't be able to meet its obligation in recent weeks several vendors reported that the IRS had missed payments to them\nInstead of making the payment to its lenders in the early morning hours the earth filed for bankruptcy the company and seeking chapter eleven protection from its debt holders rather than chapter seven which would have led to a complete closure and liquidation Steve ... new\nInternational pressure is mounting on Saudi Arabia over the case of missing journalist ... on Sunday the general manager of a sudden they own news\nChannel ...

tonight is my new as safe as I say\nWe're talking about his new paper that was published last week\nThat seems to show up formula for finding new chambers in the great pyramid more beer phone calls him more with by new when we come back after this short break this is coast to coast am [noise]\nOne atom of nitrogen and bonded with one atom of oxygen boom you just created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that fuels your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide super beach by human\nI can tell you that the uh you know the world's a crucial um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a a chronic a person that was chronicling the recall it was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there is another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nAre into this things and looking for chambers and then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are it to our space is under this things\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert truck or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something in it that self interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back a woods another research expedition to hopefully drill right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies entered really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert his estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have often marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them and of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd when we have a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we'll try a small probe into that space and see what's at and\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about there's this this this rumor has been going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally uh but just to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and things temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber and so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber\nOr the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small forward somebody\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lying so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie and is there before and the head of the line this was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to ...\nI I leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucy in winter\nAnd and and this is I'm just going to have to read this directly as in Egypt in the images it seems like all of the pyramid to Mexico have an alien in this space craft depicted somewhere ... any comments\n[noise] yeah I I Know I I remember reading this long time ago and I've found myself agree with that uh that's one way you could read it I you know I think that was fun Dana can provide that originally the he's too she's talking about the ...\nYeah or the right the lid off the uh South Africa's of a car ride\nI have I have that's our topic is in my studio in the bunker and I have a reproduction of it hanging on the wall but and I stopped and I look at that my new and I don't have any other way to look at that\nMy new and I don't have any other way to look at that ... four feet controls hand controls an oxygen mask on a plane coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI I you know I don't have any problem with that I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is it this day and age everything's on tables you just said we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is in I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in cosmic rules is one way you can explain some of these contracts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across universe through you know through um\nAh through a Clinton fields and that message ends up on our if somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see from solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line or a Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for my new\nAbsolute on her street you guys really quickly a notion that struck me when you talk to her it's structured space is a ... couple of quick jumps and laundered\nLooking at the idea of Greek scare the architecture mall a tremendous job training super big John Cornyn term papers a farming old knowledge building big garbage structures ah who's to say I mean it'd be good to\nYou know I guess people assume that the Trump will be a periods or solid\nBecause they know maybe just maybe just say structured spaces be our reporters Rajiv or the rocks and uh every arches inside British comedies like temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's the exactly\nThe conclusions are that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the is on the ... basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this can from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be theological and shop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know he reviewed a paper or but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably spaces up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of cool pool\nIt's is is high spaces inside researchers in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know ... pyramid all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back our gas Manu safe side they this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us Mm\nMm\nMm [noise]\nWe had\nI guess you\nAnd see the key word free bottle\nCoast to coast on AM twelve thirty ... deep river falls catch coast to coast overnight son twelve thirty Katie are at\n\nCome back to the coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning here in Southern California my new or the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nTo speaking of Southern California let's go to it's good to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nWelcome Monique how are you there\nOkay I didn't do that so let's go right in order to go to Mary in New Jersey Mary Europe next on coast\nAround ... how to you and your calf I'm kind of something like four years older or younger and somebody of a shiny unmanned standing there with the sword from the garden of Eden and he gets some slight food can block condoning it and the native to know or and they said\nHow are you hearing that he said I any that I Am in that town now I think that a dollar\nA tree of life it seems like off the Bible and the tiny round him to Egypt Abraham ...\nHave found that in their kid man in the air Marian ... man in there and um the Lyon county where I'm defeated the woman will crush ahead of them could they even\nFound like that could that possibly be the original spot in the garden and the\nThat that is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy\nMahoney if I remember this correctly um but yeah I think it's an interesting

in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a a into them in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and does this archaeological evidence at well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis I just came in on Twitter

nothing you know nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit is that you just chambers or for construction in engineering\nCould they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could it be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those of the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question down a great question bill I'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking for just ... I think\nBecause there's obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers so I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the ...\nSo in the ... ah the ah the hopeless was known for the center of the warship up to nine major God's this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians and I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be ... and there\nAre with inscriptions I'm so that would be very exciting is that if we're if that were ever to be found\nUm but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm withdrawing P. O. die think this is still on the table that there may have been spaces there that helped the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next ... will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten inside of the the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it was less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt where I Am heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because in years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the games the plateau but today you can ... be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there were parts I think he's a plug toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are the are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that\nWe'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt shouldn't areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\nAs depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] um that's a good question it is a great question it's a great question the question um\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this was before before Nazi Germany\nUm there there was off course German activity on the ... he's a plot so there was actually a great American German a collaboration on the gave up blood toll or George rising from Harvard and uh and ... from a\nFrom the German a fun life sick and they were excavating them stop us in Iraq but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties\nAnd then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted and there was a big break\n'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comment because I don't know\nLet's go to a show out east in the Bronx Joe you're next on goes\nHow ya doing Jimmy I'm doing good Joe say Hi to my new\n[laughter] Hyman knew how I got to take your\nGood um yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid is there any evidence that there are any any tunnels or under the ground passage ways that would connect the great pyramid to other pyramids and the vicinity and also can you tell me whether\nThere are any signs of blueprint that\nExist for either the great pyramid or any ... in that area\nA that's a fantastic question so [laughter] that's right up my alley so the first question do I am I Would refer you to Andrew calling so ... if you ask ...

I don't know you know what if when you when a antiquities goes and investigate those things and their own published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber\nI Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back you know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think uh there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around and he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looked down on the ground and he sees what do you think is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs would picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down\nAnd as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I'm no matter what\nI personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side of the rear playing by the scale of this things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about a diversity I think that's there is there's there are spaces under the things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind LBJ that's the main question\nYou brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his his that is one of the craziest videos I bet\nHis his that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean ... and his nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was but and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long dead stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then he high wash who I denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on his own expedition and film crew\nAnd went into the tunnel complex which again wasn't supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential pathway from the ... or from the ah the old Cyrus shopped um you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course he's your clothes is telling us that these are you know late period shaft and these are not from they don't dare to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I talk about the old Cyrus shop it's possible that the upper two layers are late kingdom but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure\nAnd it may connect um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah it until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of ... cost way uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you had the ...

the end of Hitler's that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the keys plateau and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the right you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think they're the uh the the the myth dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to\nHave to that or ... or Cyrus shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that

applied to there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert's favorite place to look would be a besides\nThe you know a besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nOr there could be the actual entry to this passage that we think is under the things it could be in front of the things temple and then the other thing is we I predict and mentors the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that was dedicated to a Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course that's it that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the gays applied to of course everything pacing western pacing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau\nThere is an awful lot a that is behind the uh the pyramid complex facing a west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction that is represented in those original survey maps that really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be explored because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with the huge trends and this oval ... placement um but there's nothing nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out\nAnd I do notice for a fact I don't know if this was a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows what we're going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back just as coast to

conversation tonight and and listening to an answering the questions from the coast listeners not only\nA via the phones but of course Twitter too as well an amazing amazing\nThis is great yeah it's just it's it's such an important time for research and what is going on I think that the great pyramid is finally starting to give up or some of its mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones are we've got one last segment here\nLet's go east of the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nA morning a new thought hey mourning mourning giant\nOr good morning Larry Ann how are you in the hurricane Bree okay\nUh where I'm located Irma got me but I'm I'm located on the east coast\nYeah but it it it was as such a wide big storm that it it it it affected everything up north they're\nA feel for those people have lost everything yeah\nYeah so you guys were okay over on that side\nWherever we go out on that side we've got a little weather but rain and whatever but we're good\nAll right Larry what do you have for my new\nFor something quick or Edgar Edgar Casey reading Edgar Casey on that land and it's a paper bag right it might be interested in reading and do you does life reading a first for march Nineteen sixty eight\nBut he talked about between ten thousand eleven thousand period um there was a migration of the carpet you return and then vote voted in Concord Egypt\nOne of a later this trial was raped or Edgar Casey was reading on it of course\nI'm ... all one was basically the term or the chamber and then you can train for it is not a to write a according to the news you might check that out if they do it's very and lightning\nAnd the original capstone with court\nUm ... the pyramid pyramid add rennet in it which produces under pressure five electricity and you may know all that's all right hand and they'd be written that\nI've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey\nEnergy tell your occurrence earth currents of the Nile is rerouted route uh adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it was to generate a electricity\nWell Larry let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question [laughter] are you ready if I can answer absolutely if the uh you know in Christopher done and others have talked about uh the\nThe pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator of power and energy or if that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free energy\nYep you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done uh as I said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course\nUm it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model\nThat is a completely covered by prejudices and biases he just fits all the observations into a model and that as he you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have them on board um\nYou know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card let's go to Carol in Charleston D.C Carol you're up next on coast\nHow Hi Carol hello Carol\nOh I hear quite ... several years ago\nOh well last me twice ... found um I thought oh man power plants hatchery him all underground oh did you hear a little bit\nYou're on oh did you hear anything about ... you\nKnow I as far as I Know I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know but to them is not discovered but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nA woman's your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved when when it's every third grade [noise]\nYeah that's a great question so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know it's supposed to be affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to just uh they have to review the application and they may say no and\nYou don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers and they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing Carol how are you researching on your own now\nAnd ... and ... and ... they found an addict carrion why napping apple and added that in the national news you twice\nYeah and and Carol or one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly so does my new\nThat others out there are attracted\nTo you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I encourage and I encourage blogging\nAnd creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end let's let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next tacos Manuel\nThank you how you doing and I know a thing over but participating or what I what I wanted to know like the gentleman that called before a film that there was that a bird or something\nOn the hieroglyphics on on the the the\nTwo of the game but there was also one in in a scheme how cruel and there was a little one the mythical if those may be the same thing if the bird the same thing oh that's a good question\nAnd your and my other question I wanted to know how can we get all this stuff and come up before and you say right off the bat a lot of money it costs a lot of money to do stuff in there\nYeah you're absolutely I'm not hearing I'm hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you had brought up a room why you answer this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's where this was his point but the first\nOr the birds a dinner represented a throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramid and and we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that uh you know early research has worked confronted with when they looked at the Egyptian ... lives is if the symbol is the sound or if it if it actually\nMeans what it shows uh that's probably the most important questions so when you have a bird in an Egyptian a text or most likely most of the time the bird is not what is the the the symbol does not me I have nothing to do with the bird\nIt ... it's basically a sound so when you see an old it's the letter M. it has nothing to do with it now actually when you see the ... so that's horrors\nThan ... times more information to my best friends\nAnimal

one that\nYou don't put in a drawer and forget about no [noise] it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single\nDay and tomorrow and the day after that\nAnd for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet and every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt\nYou don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nForty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly at true north south east and west and\nExactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain as pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read Hi Howard lipsticks nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer\nAir quotes we don't know you know but it's really big [laughter]\nThat's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred years to figure out the language\nAnd you would think that with all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone sometimes somewhere would have shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it but it never happened\nAnd although today we know about the Rosetta Stone and the quest to the code everything the great and eat eat Egypt shunned amnesia that was already happening and in full swing centuries before Cleopatra committed suicide\nStory um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that's just kind of open something up and and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing\nUm a few a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add to coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\nYeah what you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three belts does for when\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it your pauses believed that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three it was you know and so I looked at the statue is probably look at the statue of email and then we looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue\nThat uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol\nOf a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue um I notice it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is amazing ... by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows all the dreams the law which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the ... were built if there was this things then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember at the statue I remembered the line is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was caused the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out\nAnd it and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in let's admit it and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the mother gives a plateau in general but you have the great pyramid the grades fangs a two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut is not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt shouldn't history where you would think\nWell you know the ... love to write everything that he loved to\nGo to tell their story and not only that but taxes and and accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except for the great springs in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know the one answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with it stinks you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won an inscription that refers to\n... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have and hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something at least is things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know ...\nAlive and if you walk into that too is actually a reference to the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of its called uh the whole rise of coup fool\nAnd next to it it's the um the you know to the contrary is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they call that cover his grade and kudos pyramid was called the whole rise of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to two points in the direction and forget about the other ... about how was builder who built it or the year was build\nYou know we still don't even understand the purpose and that is very computer all\nThe way to have auditors um you know ... century but see you know this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of details you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years\nUm and there were machines that were holding up the blocks but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all\nBut yes that was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century\nThat may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream fill up between the positive things that he is the one who built it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small reference to ... but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law on the other hand is very direct it specifically states um\nFirst of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name Cooper was the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the U.S says very unequivocal early ... when ... came to the ... things already exist that in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen and Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now this coast to coast damn are murals Jimmy church or ... minute ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nWind up more of us and I just moved on Tuesday in\n[noise]\n\n\nOr ... minute said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory cell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and end the dreams della uh most of the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things is\nThere I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question um uh so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting\nThe seconds things are as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo but uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and\nI Know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end\nBy as things and these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable so so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground it was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things are on the other side of denial but it's there it's things buried under this sounds a let's say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\nTeam and tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired the banks but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course Egypt colleges most Egypt pauses do not accept the inventories are as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\nUm they're the or you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text and\nOn in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to be a means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building is mentioned and the the verb ... this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the red sea you know they're saying well you okay this is the hardest talks about to a store and being ... or ... or\nA but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a ... interview you and the other day he made a great point you've said that\nUh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship Portuguese that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you ... so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind\nAbout it and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a pyramid like who who was dealing with uh also wanted to use a plateau why they could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes\nYes there is a there is a reference to a hit Knutson\nUm Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is with the news and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built a pair of it for her the southern most of the three ah off the tree a queen ... on an empty field in on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human towards though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting just because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think is the poop shows that she was a princess so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or a an old Cyrus\nThere's mentions of ISIS and hot or a an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an ... story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS of aside as we're not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions a ... and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the house or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids are crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same hands with the same care flight and those would be more simple to build\nAnd you would you would expect those to be just as elegant it even you know more complex yeah but they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just that common that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a new since pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the caller yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom and\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we have been told over and over again\nAnd it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and and what I liked about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holds you didn't have to you know like a a ... the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful\nAnd nowadays uh it's kind of like the pyramid is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nAnd that's also what I wanted to do I want us to really get some information out of the pyramid without you know uh putting my hand on of course the chips in government is protecting the monuments and I completely agree with that
