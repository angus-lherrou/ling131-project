very different subject\nIn the second half the story that involves incredible acts of heroism treachery\nIncompetence sheer terror it is the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the sinking of the USS Indianapolis it's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind that official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists out worked for years to tell the whole story I was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days\nSailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of a book a but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the ... project\nWas a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out a course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild ... better known these days for his investigations of missing people he's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery and tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject\nIt traces the sasquatch story through newspaper reports and historical records that name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight but the big guy himself has been around much longer than that these stories go way way back centuries\nAlong with related stories of wild man and giants and we're happy to welcome day back to the program to talk about his original investigation and where it's led that's coming up momentarily\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that there would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who someone coming into town\nI started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal\nAnd uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something to a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained\nFor the state of Oklahoma\nAnd Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the schedule the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nHarvey and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd ah it's kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh started\nMost vocal the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches Harvey myself and Harvey wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief because the ...\nOklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge had hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera ... and it was just shocking and when the witnesses saw the sketches\nA lady and to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if the sack Lee what you look like and when you talk about the owners they would consistently say this\nIs another tribe of people is on animals is there are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least the coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area and this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nSo wondering about the hoop areas the trinity river a great salmon and steal headed area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop of from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here uh that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path\nI knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it and many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request\nA ah a PHD name Melba catch them\nAnd Dr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to shoot blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted\nA many more than ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood survivor\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this be an a\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what they showed was that the fight pet went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side\nTo the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to a Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper\nBut if you are strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't\nIn Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples cells tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big what Cal silver haired tickets into the break\n[noise]\nI'm Sorry you\nKnow [noise] known me\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for here well ... looks different than any other mammal here in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big for her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta there's a lot of attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together\nAnd it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the you up a world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence in ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part of\nThe best I could say is it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender bank\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours and\nHow could that be um we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and succeed apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study\nThey've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia that data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got got thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um\n... you said that the this\nThis was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well but\nThese things are the\nThree different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases I'm missing people that seemed emit that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded\nIs two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four years eight gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k.\nThere were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it ah we're Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with uh\nThey just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations is genius there's a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the uh appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map of because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same locations as the big\nFight [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement\nAbout giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants\nThe big for that were buried or were they something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... century showing that you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate were all these went and it's set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Marilyn that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness sees this on the ... of a rubber an animal between twelve and Fifteen feet high\nIt's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportions the body the feet are two feet long and Harry oh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the descriptions semi modern descriptions a big one\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being\nExcept the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about was in Nineteen thirty four\nThere was a series of trails site incidents in Washington were hikers and

to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first stab Bush\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's ... with Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days with him earlier this year\nAnd the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio\nIn the air and on the ground it's really strange [laughter]\nBruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day sightings\nAgain from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\n\nUm you know some of the the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but ... the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect\nAnd uh I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot and how it's kind of strange\nThat it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's a similarity um some of the descriptions I I wouldn't have to leave through it here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing\nWhich suggests to me maybe they were you\nThe thing or just a ... kind of a thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing\nAnd kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but it\nHappens too often for people to be fabricating haired occasionally but not very often\nUm\nIf you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where\nThey put people start their head start spinning but fact where there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said they saw a UFO and\nCoast time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds and when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust that will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and they're different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did and when\nYou start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hard don't like it the UFO die hards uh like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all\nBut you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are and all the way you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents so they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them in this oh I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely milked\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter]\nThen the same man told him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my ... a TV and Rowley and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there\nSo dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing because I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take the earth or they're unarmed of war\nAnd many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did he get their\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am [noise]\nMm\nI'm I feel like Rome are also a way that we could find out more about wild man because there are Amazonian tribe network is discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea of revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer because of their own and my question is\nEasy it's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones are going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on this and people are has worked real well and you can't use a drone international park it's against the law and there's a huge crime so probably won't happen [noise]\nThat George Bush onto the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should have kind of touch on it for the people here [noise]\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic\nInstance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers and we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was\nA just outside the window and as soon as the dogs mated noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community and you can hear it it I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off and\nThe police officers chased that ah I think they've they've found some tracks it led to\nA there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we describe on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it and through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell you they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh uh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um\nHas seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... Smith the ones you talked to keen on his saddle um he thought Bigfoot\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five of us are Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... ... and he was the ... the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as the as a tall a figure that was taller than his saddle\nAnd ah adjusted kill these just talked to a cane and the heat and came to introduce it still is that I'm a man I'm Kirsten longer here and there and I might gold will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls says\nYou brought that up I just thought the morning culture LVS ... that we have you know there's two stories are really famous that story than just chilies this too is Joseph Smith nephew you\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and the the lady Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple\nAnd I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and somebody he wants his hand and they just crashed a cat and king wrong and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who is skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances because I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot you taking all he does he have any idea what's going on because like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a ... everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are ... social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kinds of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big foot type\nEncounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was would match big for it but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nA Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said a mind spoke but more like it spoke to him\nSo hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things I've always stated that\nLike this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts\nAll of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion\nAnd why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect when you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA but\nIf you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that is coming to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nDoesn't [laughter] and I should point out that you know you did to address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think I'm going okay there's\nThere's a story that John Green wrote about a a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man and he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and\nOne of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed green lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how came came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other accounts in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person through the forest\nHenry about you know\nI think are so low but there's a story\nOut of Wyoming\nThat I I don't put much Clinton said it because people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared in Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who are poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm it appeared dead\nSo these people never came forward I don't know who they are a district was given to me from another big foot researcher that's well well known and this guy was called supposedly by these two guys and then he told me so it's third hand down the line\nRocky buddy Afghan someone it's pre

nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours for anyone who is not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to\nOne of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Robert Charles character went delivered of moving powerful

injured and that was what really sent her on this fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman decided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb\nLittle boy with later ... head to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that Truman did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport the station of components of the bomb she did that a native record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on to twenty an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across the ... from Guam for the Philippines and all my straight west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or Stevie middle of the Philippines these on July thirty is Nineteen forty five minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called ice fifty eight planted by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she might have passionate have fired exposed for he does it Indianapolis with two of them\nThe first one almost completely lose a foul off the ship Indianapolis the heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very quick about three hundred men went down with the shift\nOf a little under nine hundred made it into the water alive\nAnd when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued and but uh they weren't and they've spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd died as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've bought the hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story that most people know about Indianapolis she was a spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights for days and the water\nAnd only three hundred and sixteen men survive\nBut Sarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and they continue to sort of continued over after they drop it off\nOr wanted to share with us the how secrecy or ... which obviously was necessary military necessity a lead to tragedy and how you'd probably interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that\nHeld secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was an admiral McCormack and the message he received was garbled and so you know political said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them\nYou know that was one of the first thing I'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was\nProtocol ... the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought well I guess I don't have to report that either and so\nHe took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship wasn't there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then\nBeyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines see reporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't\nArea well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the coach has been broken and that we were using that and so\nYeah he should not have been\nThere without an escort he should have had and\nTaking a step back in the Annapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns and so she should've had something you know first of all that sold our second of all that had\nAny harm or ability yeah armor to an arm or I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her armor with exceptionally thin compared to many of the new leadership and so that was one of the reason why she thinks so quickly uh you know\nSo all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm\nAnd so much of that played into the secrecy of the mission and why she was out there and why this information and was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTold me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there that I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWell I think a big part of it they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families talking with them\nThat you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know the screenplay and eventually as a book and lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the\nAccurate story however heart and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you you have to know these people are a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives your piecing them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back and land on an apple a story because really the man or the Fort Hood astronaut as it is to you know circle back and the men who\nMarry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army on Robert and I'm major named Robert Vernon and spent the last couple of years of the war running down all of the novel material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb uh on the continent of\nEurope though one that messing with them\nAnd then burn and very components of little boy in Ireland\nUm that is the final grade and better and in Europe and and if the conflict and so in writing the book we try to pull back that lands and bring in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hush and we've had him for the call and tell me you've got to leave and come ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where to begin to recognize it even of the men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing well\nI'll tell you what are we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy beyond goes to goes day or\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against her to call at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors at radar and more technology for his that marine has gotten a summary didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and said he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of it\nUp until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother says commanders go down to solve the grave for lack of technology to eat very caring you had a wife he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun um we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and get even more information about his later life have before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because of the U.S Navy I mean they took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court Marshall per capita McVeigh and then\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of about things when but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to the moments right after these torpedoes swam a decided the Indianapolis\nOr chaos breaks out um\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for ... the clouds you just part of the moon came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nIn the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt first to\nThe star bird and then it goes down by the bell so\nMen are being trapped inside\nThe ship unable to his state from their compartments and you know Linda mentioned before they believe about three hundred and men went down with the ship and even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her\nAnd were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half is what they believe and you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but no standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side\nAnd there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were you know somewhere in even in life jacket\nSome were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them you know fellow ship made or whomever and others had to just swim until a sailor would pass away\nAnd then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead Taylor and put it on them I\nMean this was incredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just got on the ship\nNot some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission hadn't really gone to any drills yet\nSome didn't know how to swim and there are just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship at the last moment\nWe kind of a red vain actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very thick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer I'm you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering are from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this feel\nSo no one's in really great shape\nYou know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe there's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nThat and there wasn't that it you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nThe um I guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that the new ones coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you describe from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nThat's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned\nThe current they move in about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together in the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve that swelled some days it's it's clear his glasses on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve twelve along with these current so\nOver time over the course of the the five nights and four days and then become spread out over a twenty five mile area and I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote that from altitude\nI read the plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism acts of cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group and the water's the they did at their mentioned the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd kept in park within that group and he really than\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep the men together the only resource that that group of men had decide their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets with the things\nAnd had the sides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jacket\nWith a single line that was about a hundred feet long\nAnd so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line and kept in park would uh\nHelp the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from a dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumbed to hallucinations and and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all going to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you\nHad precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nSend men or even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse there was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and there was hoarding\n'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as I'm\nHearing these stories even without the injuries and the terrible burns and the the fact they have no water supplies they're out there in exposed to the elements for days they they have no water and after\nDays they're just going crazy and then uh you know you have to deal with the sharks that's the that's the terror that most of us know about because of the movie\nAnd uh apparently that is not exaggerated but not not by much any way of Sarah maybe you want to talk about that part of the story\nHuman Services dumped us kids

a half months later\nSomething amazing happened which will be teased tomorrow on my hot actually contract\nAlmost staggering about this one is that you could come back to\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but he was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said\nUh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to\nReally repair the damage and also he was you know in this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either but I'm In\nLater interviews Sarah I found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted was that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had been kept in the day\nHe was angry years later Sarah right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis the submarine the namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain and built Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was\nA he commissioned bill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know\nKind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty\nAnd you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a crew the survivors and kept the McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because\nYou know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from family you didn't feel he's been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this Nineteen sixty event and how was he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen\nSince Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal so they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana and kept in the day was dreading it that when he got there they actually um\nOut a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the air\nOut a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed to receding lines\nAre across the tarmac because they didn't have jet ways the way we do now they would they would just they would the plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines and when captain they they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the clapping and tears came to his eyes and eat and he couldn't believe that they were receiving him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSarah talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records a share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past and and if so what were they\n... actually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and\nJoined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking so you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know\nFreedom of freedom of Information Act should've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the is the source to get and our contacts said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist\nAnd so interestingly enough you know a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and saved fifty three men his\nHis grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general sorry I'm trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who\nGot us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because\nIn the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed and so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new court of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship saying but in the water for those five nights and four days\nLynn did you talk about the life of media Lee after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell a few did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves but for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die of their exposure in their injuries um so I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately\nSurvive so they were taken to the hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS how ... how ... which was an escort carrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nI actually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home uh\nCaught buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them ... got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out and then stayed and made careers of the navy [noise]\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind then they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nBut there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families um they held it in for years and years and years um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about that today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that that these men were different\nI think about that Robert ... character in jaws you know you get that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and the\nUh it's very moving scene in it and that was great I was going to use the clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage him in the book or or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\n[noise] well yeah it's really you know when let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know\nOne of the things that really\nComes out every time is that most people learned about this story from jobs so it's an essential part of the stories history is that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it\nBy watching jobs you know they came home several accounts\nCame home saw the movie were really impacted by it and especially this scene and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about well so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\nWe've been since er leather Indianapolis is the book when we come back we'll open up the phone lines and maybe uh maybe you've got some questions or comments or calls we'll be right back\n\nWhen he\n\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship\nAnd I didn't know what he was talking about it for the way of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe petrol group which has the vessel that were slow responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts and they were the first one to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so bill and I spent the next three hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them\nThe news that they're shipped had been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened and then it happened in their lifetime I'm ... [laughter]\nMostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nUp winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they uh you know were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Sam Koch who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny if ten or twenty sixteen and we said while through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and tell the whole story of the ship and and give the entire history\nAnd draw a new analysis that various things that happen in the story if you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nOh boy we were we nervous about that that he really really has endorsed a story and I went to his full court since he saw what he\nWhat we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great a movie um a full big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but the west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California has a personal connection to the story high jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... to rescue those ... and the water and to help you know one ... you can shoot ... you know\nAnd I never saw my father used to I was ... years ago but I never saw him cry enjoy Detroit and talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with the on the USS that peace will take the oil or that that that the you know the name of his ship that to me I\nDon't know I don't remember it's on ... stone and I was thinking about you for calling ... yeah what was the name of the ship but he did me she was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talk ... huge horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talk about in the about\nThe chip all the you know all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just it just part of the ethos of that generation but those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea uh he was going to drink your interns many firms clubs you know believe in God and he was a police officer who's officer who Thirty years ago there was an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic can go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer of the ... that was considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same if you didn't really know what he was getting into and ah he knew that\nThat had been found probably buy a submarine but they didn't know what exactly had happened and there was um\nA sailor who spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish well fish is another word for it torpedo and head of the captain ...\nHe tried to get everybody out of there he said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get out of here we are going to leave the scene and his officers\nWe're going to get out of here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad was had been on that ship\nThanks jury appreciated wildcard line run and used in the morning on good\nMorning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de while he was twenty six years old he was the Ensign doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his uh I guess just she just you know of all of his memory loss and I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter\nOf the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors I've got the letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this\nTo read this is talk about the sharks it talks about the fact that the pull these guys up kicking the sharks off their rear end showing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been at some of the reunions but never did talk about this but the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole town it's its history its historical\nI Would love to share this with a young ladies and if I can get them get an information and\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna O R R gal there will get the information for you will pass it on to win and Sarah and thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nClass I don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm about five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet\nOn Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think think an arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you in from the callers about um\nHow how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside I don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe it wasn't how ... how the er I I don't know I think yeah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now that uh it is an interesting contrast isn't it and then I think it has to do with the\nThe um ... the media that we have today and they'd be able to share everything instantly all the time and that wasn't the case back then\nEast of the Rockies Joe in Long Island Morning Joe\nYeah Hi I'm Wondering uh you know that

story that involves incredible acts of heroism treachery\nIncompetence and sheer terror it is the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the sinking of the USS Indianapolis it's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nRemarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story I was totally blown away by

elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthors Lynn Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of a book a but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots\nYou know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoopla project\nWas a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out of course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild ... better known these days for his investigations of missing people\nHe's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery in tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject\nIt traces the sasquatch story through the newspaper reports and historical records that name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight but the big guy himself has it been around much longer than that these stories go way way back centuries\nAlong with related stories of wild man and giants and we're happy to welcome date back to the program to talk about his original investigation and we're it's led that's coming up momentarily\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big store in Hooper that live ... miles away who someone coming into town\nI certainly think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans\nAnd I found a diamond unbelievable look an individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease\nOutstanding law enforcement person and a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man is\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept accepted him because he's a ... Native American chief got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell when it happens and\nHarvey and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of Hooper and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd ah it's kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sent in stunned disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah\nThe ... because the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge had hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that apes characteristics that you would think of in a face in the chest et cetera\nAnd I was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if you ... you look like\nAnd when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another tribal people is on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least a college distance right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area and this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nThe only thing about the hoop areas the trinity river a great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop of from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here or do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be\nVisible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah a PHD name Melba catch them\nAnd Dr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to shoot blood et cetera that we bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this be an a\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what they showed was that the fight period went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side to the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to\nA Jordan into that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could've been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explain to her and he explained to her\nA proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't\nIn Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples cells tell a story that's phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big what Cal silver haired tickets into the break\n[noise]\nI'm Sorry you\nKnow [noise] known Neal\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see them on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback of bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results and there's a lotta\nA lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the U.S all world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very turf conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part\nBut the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with human ...\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours and how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit ... she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got got thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada\nThree in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k.\nThere were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it we're Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six [noise] and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing but I started to pay attention and I got it\nThe article in the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius is a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything goes you know what this map up because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same location that's the big\nFight [laughter] and but it was his statement about giants that were found in past\nCenturies in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants\nBig for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the pirates and showing that you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and uh yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\n\nWhy did these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidates were all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one or early in your book it's from the Marilyn that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness to use this on the ... of a rubber an animal between twelve and Fifteen feet high\nIt's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the feet are two feet long and Harry oh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions a big one\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it but\nWhen you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about was in Nineteen thirty four\nThere was a series of trail site incidents in Washington were hikers and hunters and things were getting rocks thrown at them and they saw this figure that looked like a big foot well then they went and told the sure from the share if it was going to get a policy together to go kill this thing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "22"}
