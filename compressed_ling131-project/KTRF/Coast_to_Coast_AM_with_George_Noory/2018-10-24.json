heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown the country now be route used to be the jewel of the middle East that isn't anymore Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or are they a rainy and who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God is a Shiite religious militia [noise] um\nI'm underground Iranian proxy group that ... of formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of living on in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as as you know of ... ... between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite population for domination of the country and we're always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight or one of the Shiite spiritual leader of um of murder to Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... the Iranians for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they ... they send 'em intelligence specialist somebody said revolutionary guards and\nTo live in ... with Syria's blessing and they set of faith in Lebanon and they establish amongst the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nInside the country I'm for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence with everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglected this this arrival and the amount of money in the amount of influence with the Iranians are spreading in Lebanon\nOr the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest\nIn keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than than any other group I Know from\nAnd then Israeli blood on their hands than than any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of just some history\nA this had never been done this was an organization that had a literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a heck of a whole heck of a lot of us that that's certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWas ever get into that story I Want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty eight as Well Fred heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to even worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question uh you can only look back on the events of ah\nNine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region why we need a footprint uh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nOr and or a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil and\nUh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nAll right we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz their book is called Babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Samuel would you be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there in the if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the the Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties the period we're ... and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of 'em this fundamentalist suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm is this for the United states in Iraq\nIt was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there I'm ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen\nIn two thousand ... launched a um horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege I'm way of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm\nI'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we ... them operatives in this country has for many years\nAnd it is an arm and extension of Iran is I'm a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important to us national interest\nAll countries of course worked through straw parties we work with will Selma bin Laden and the movies you're hygiene in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there giving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah\nBut why are we getting talks with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them or we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI I think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging\nIran militarily since\nOur hostages were seized with the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which\nWas um on the thirty five years ago to this day\nOut on hold on for a second set and we'll come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book being rude rules next on the coast to coast stadium\nNever missed a detail of the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian use of groups like Hezbollah\nTo export terrorism throughout the middle east and the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was um directly responsible for a lack\nOf response to suicide truck bombings against the embassies the marine and the kidnapping\nOf a CIA station chief some things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Britain tell us about William Buckley\n[noise] a bill was a a a true patriot George uh he uh [noise] grow up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA I and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote them\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm a bill grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a\nElderly companion or that he lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up ah\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm at which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into other than it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm\nA he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things\nWhen you know didn't surprise me because of ah the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ... to\n... just I'm a study history and specially military history uh so uh in Nineteen sixty he uh he joins or the U.S army again a and goes into special forces\nAre and I'm also a associated with the CIA in that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or to Vietnam and\nWhere he is also a again awarded the silver star a for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger\nAnd uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know ... known for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand so to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so uh that was his Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine war was a pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt well\nUh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um it you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meets niches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around it [noise]\nIt's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh\nSecurity personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but uh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\n[noise] he was kidnapped on march ...\nSeen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage debriefing team where are\nWe were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... and the spot and Germany after he had been held in captivity and and he told his bill had died\nAnd that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find in so\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack for it\nAll my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then um\nWe we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks\nI'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran\nA and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nWhile I'm which I'm not you\nCertainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley um revealed information I'm a very classified nature um station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager\nOf the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other agents he knew the name of their sources\nAnd he hit all that information I'm In his in his mind because he has a controller and then he has to supervise it I'm One of the um [noise]\nYou know one of the things that we review in the book is shortly after bill was um confirmed that he was abducted um personnel in the station um retreated out of the ... out of country very very quickly because of their

at the point of a gun I'm through force\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of um he will Jima moments of raising\nThe flag where they can say that\nTheir ... their opinion very equals that they've achieved they've achieved Harry and\nBoth both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach their very very small neighborhood um are are bent ... are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action\nFor just the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different sorts of ... of landmarks and milestones can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempt to\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George good morning hay bright\nHey listen ah name what about what a mess over there in the middle east and and and than it used to ride all the horses are wrong are no good over there I Am not a bed rail and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decades and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is\nA must William Buckley this is the forgotten history that nobody you know really remembers but that's it\nHistory that nobody you know really remembers but if he gave up secret in I don't know you know begin or not was your initial trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nA meta or keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\n[noise] sure good question Brian uh answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station\nOr got them out of a country a shop\nOr they had to shut down or their source network a and anticipate the entire ... chain that that had been compromised their uh they had to shut down face houses ah where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that\nUh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man in Lebanon\nThat had access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the intelligence service for example\nA Kenny horse trader swap with a let's say a the Russian KGB at the time [noise]\nSo those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so a was a operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a your entire um human collection\nNetwork a which is never easy\nSam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm a Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims that Israel has below fighters are getting on\nOn short on characteristics we I'm I'm a crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities fighting in Syria um\nThe uh the Lebanese fighters in in in Syria have played a significant\nRole in in ... being able to the outside regime being able to remain in power um Hezbollah remains I'm One of the world's largest narcotics traffickers a money laundering of 'em you name it we've out pose some throughout the world including South America\nAnd um has will remain very clear and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\nDrug wars do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\nUm yes there is a very large Shiite population in South America in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um um [noise] we learned that um the the government of president ... in Venezuela\nUm had a um a a a shuttle service on the Venezuelan UM Airlines troubling Damascus and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way to go to court and then from Lebanon B word dispersed\nThroughout um points throughout the um Europe in the middle east um\nThe ... the money from those cells were laundered I'm In West Africa um some of the money was smuggled as a result of stolen car rings in the United states [noise] um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs shut up ... you know clinics to help people but legalized drugs don't put people in jail little stop people from robbing people because of the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one way you're getting these people who are making all the Germans drugs and distributed um what do you think\nWell a large ... a large portion of his ... budget comes from um illegal activities and I I think that's um you know when we think about that we have to remember the more important than the religious elements in more important even sometimes\nFace sponsorship of terrorist organizations are criminal and they\nThey survive they thrive and they operate with um with criminal criminal gangs um resident\nAnd that's that's that's where we're going to come back and wrap things up one final calls nuts dot coast to coast they [noise]\n\n\nAnd twelve thirty ... the river bowl gender goes it goes over nights on twelve thirty J. T. R. S.\n[noise]\nNow we're back or their final segment with Fred Burton and Samuel Katz their work is going to be rude rules are website linked linked up at ... dot com Freda want to get your take on these ... situation of course and\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly was killed that the consulate butchered or you know I guess because of what is his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia\nOr but geez my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] my goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah\nAh disposed of some bodies via similar methods so we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates a\nAnd this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a\nTo actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility or with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and so ah either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nAlthough it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this is a based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for\nA there appears to then a few other a Saudi prince lives that have disappeared too so I'm\nJust ... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of ah of the royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter ... when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of boils away at the rich Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a\nA effort behind the scenes to to try to ah make sense of what took place and and to move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes\nOr you know the intelligence services just go about their business and um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and\nUh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos ah there's still an intelligence provider\nNo that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are uh at times [laughter] ah I'm a I'm sad to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know some\nOf rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those don't or at times work as smoothly as a as most people think ah because remember a\nYou know there are no friendly intelligence services that's the one mantra that you learn and and basic age in school is a there are no friendly intelligence services\nAnd each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is in the best interests of their country\nAnd you're more cars showed me apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer a non ... uh there was so big you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and\nOne of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him in a in a local speaking event uh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah\nAnd you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nUs I mean he's more well known now dead then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know wasn't one of these cases where uh you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB\nDid going into the u._k. and and taking\nOut scribe Paul when ...\nYou know the poisoning or you know so uh you know do do these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\n[noise] well and you don't want to be in a Turkish president that's that's the one given\nYeah that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx slits going to start a Tom go ahead\nI like to say that their leaders are horrendous caper is Yemen [laughter] I mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name\nAnd how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians when they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take ... and make it a temporary a highly of the was not for oil and that would go nuts for silver but for the sake of humanity to stop\nThe ... from uh\nSending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing has to do at least stabilize it that way and then there's another\nStabilize it that way and then there's another aspect to this story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made a mess headed Libya\nAnd in the ... they they should go back there and retake the area in the creative same government for the Libyans\nI well I think I tried that Tom but it's just sailed miserably so far for an exam you of course wrote books on Benghazi that horrible situation there\nA coffee of course was no Boy Scout we hated the guy he was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid a un straight gave up his nukes and his new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh you know the state department or has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot uh and uh you look at bin ... I I'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization mild outfit is hired more agents ah\nThey've they've now train they now train and protect with buildings on fire or they've worked with F. D. N. Y. to develop protocols for that or as an agent or I was never trained at the state department or a ... as to how to do that in a smoke filled environment so\nThere's been a lot of lessons learned and a lot of changes made in protection\nA been God's he was a mess I mean ... Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh or as the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya uh they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been and um\nThe agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the the CIA um security support team were heroes you know they can and ah and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but ah um it's just a a another long list of disasters\nThat has happened and and [noise] um\nLet's let's hope that we don't see any more on the horizon how many Libyans storm our embassy\n[noise] um than do you recall the exact number I I don't remember off the top of my head\nRevering reports um I Would say between ... and a couple of

secret weapons and so on but it's a big or the ocean is is it not that there's been a lot of people who have thing that I think that it may be UFOs come from the ocean you know\nMaybe that's just one of the other thing that we can't possibly understand right now but a lot of people do see them\nSo why do you think people ... are so fascinated with the unusual and the paranormal I mean hence you show my show I mean people love this stuff they can't get enough of that how come\n[noise] um [noise] I think it makes our lives seem a little\nA lesson and every you know it makes them a little extraordinary that these things happening around us all the time you know we just don't ... that was the head of the book came from the haunted universe that maybe maybe we live in the universe where everything goes wrong and the other universes that are supposed to be like as everything goes right and I mean we're in the one\nThat um but um I don't know I've always\nFound it fascinating because it day to day life it just seems like there's a routine to life and then all of a sudden you know somebody you know sees that goes to someone you know has seen a UFO and and like it's just that kind of unreal part of life that kind of touches you and I don't know I just find it fascinating\nYou think people have a need to be scared baffled\nI think they I think a lot of people have a need to be

sit around a campfire and you had to make sure that you are aware of all through the night so something that doesn't happen so you know who knows but you know you're right a lot of people like it or in all forms of it the medium\nWell and we ... we want to be ... because ... you know we want to believe that big foot\nExist as a creature that it's not some ape out there in the woods we want to believe that you will ... come from other planetary systems and it's not just some\n... nature throwing a plasma balls or anything like that we want to believe that there's an afterlife and goes to

in a way you know that that but they can't\nBe an explanation for everything that's the way I I kind of look at it you know that\nThere are the things that happen out there and you certainly a big pot of all kinds of different just strange things ah people see things and you know they all can be making them up they all can't be hoaxes\nThat we have instances of the book where you know hundreds of people thousands of people thought different kind of paranormal type stuff so\nThat has to be something behind it maybe it's all tied in together you know um we talk about this on the show a lot that maybe big footing goes in UFOs Loch Ness monster all the whole thing all comes from the same thing when the first people to think about that but we talk about that a lot\nUm but it's it's an endless fascination with us and with a lot of\nPeople well and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people in Ninety nine of them are making these stories that they she goes to new lows and big foot you've\nGot that one person who's not lying who has seen something very unusual in that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers because that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\nUh-huh sure it all it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nTell Linda ... who's a reporter Mac\nOr she's an expert in crops formations and are truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources that the man and one of those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth's doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us\nWhatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way\nAnd I told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one ... he's the unusual one it's an amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nAnd ... for sure you know like a ghost story you know if you could talk to if there's one person was come back here from the afterlife sets it most amazing thing that's ever happened\nOne person always come back here from the afterlife sets it was amazing thing

headlines\nAll the time all the time you know this guy Australia but a lot of women right in in what way area and [noise] you know there was some stuff that he didn't know about some of them are at a size but who knows but when one see what the jail they did stop so\nYeah they did stop and there could have been a few copycats object to it that's true they're always on the lookout for those how did you accumulate the stories for haunted universe how did you get them\nWell uh you know once again had boxes of all this different research in that for a while I worked for Barrett tore up a website that was part of a true TV CBS is\nUh-huh okay yeah they just decide me to you know five Fifteen an odd stories or a month and that just you know I bought lots of books on line and so on and just accumulated over this filed the files of strange stories\nAre you still finding new stories Mac\n... all the time yeah uh-huh I'm sure\nThey don't stop and I'm sure you've got some favorites or after

in and they see on the floor the body of another old man they pulled him over they turn him over right because he's on his stomach they roll 'em over and it's a little man let them in\nA while they turn around and that guy is gone in theory is dead on the floor\n[laughter] stories like that huh [laughter] [laughter] to think wow what's going on\nSo he got a call from an EMT who was on the scene

San ... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown the country now be used to be the jewel of the middle east there isn't any more for it is it\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with the Rand backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God it is a Shiite religious militia [noise]\nI'm a\nUnderground Iranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as you know was always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leaders of murder to Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and the ... of the uranium for a possible fertile ground to split the revolution in Lebanon and they sent the salaries they send 'em intelligence specialists and they sent revolutionary guards and\nTo live and on with Syria's blessing and they said that they should live and on and they establish almost the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nInside the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho were Journal of the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence with everywhere um family the the two people of the two groups that neglected this this arrival and the amount of money in the amount of influence with uranium through spreading I Love it on\nOr the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on the U.S embassy and the hijackings and the\nMary from investigating the attacks on\nUS embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of some history\nUh they said never been done this was an organization that had a literally a snatch or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it was certainly shocking for us to that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUm we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWas and we get into that story I Want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty eight as well for and for what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question uh you can only look back on the events of ah\nNine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint a and the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nA and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz their book is called Babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Sam you're with your book be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break\nGive us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset along fine rainy and special forces to help keep I'm president of off of um regime in power um has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties the period we're afraid and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged to probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm is this for the United states in Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq\nDeveloped there I'm ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen\nIn two thousand ... launched a um horrific war against Israel where I'm late fees age I'm way of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm\nI'm a truck for groups in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we ... them operatives in this country has for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran if I'm\nA desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important in the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with Osama bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting tough with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them or we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive\nAbout engaging Iran militarily since\nOur hostages were seized the U.S embassy in Tehran um many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran has luck in the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which\nWas um thirty five years ago to this they hold on\nHold on for a second set and we'll come back to this point and we'll talk with you and friend as well about your book be rude rules next on the coast to coast they\nNever missed a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com [noise]\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with the wrong might bring I think the Iranian use of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing of the embassies the marine\nAnd the kidnapping of a CIA station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor burden tell us about what you Buckley [noise] ah there was a a a true patriot Georgia he uh grow up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not to journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA I and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years Roberta\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm a bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar are lucky enough to ah get the cooperation of bills or family has a\nElderly companion or that he lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm an which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into other and it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nA as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things\nWhen you know didn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ... to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history [noise] uh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again or an goes under special forces\nAre and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter and recruiter\nAnd um little goes off or to Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so that this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nUp you know ... known for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so um\nThat was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Bay roots clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on him\nNo doubt well\nUh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um ... you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meets niches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a\nIn Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around it\n[noise] it's a good question or I can\nTell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period uh they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but uh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase it\nWith an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\n[noise] he was kidnapped\nOn march sixteenth Nineteen eighty\nHim he was kidnapped on march sixteenth\nNineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage debriefing team where are we were assigned a at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... and these button Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had voted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so\nAh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack for into\nAll my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then um\nWe we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but\nUm it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a cherry barracks I'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so\nAre we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] uh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nWhile I'm which I'm not you certainly a smoking gun\nAs to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley um revealed information I'm a very classified nature as station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um\nThe branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon so he knew the names of the other agents he knew the name of their sources\nAnd he had all that information I'm In his in his mind because he had to control them and\nThen he has to supervise I'm One of the um [noise]\nYou know one of the things that we reveal in the book is shortly after bill was um confirmed that he was\nAbducted um personnel in the station um retreated out of the ... out of the country on a very very quickly because of their identity is what has become known 'em it's
