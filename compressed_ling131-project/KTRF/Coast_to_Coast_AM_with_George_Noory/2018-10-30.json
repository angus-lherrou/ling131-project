going to tell us tonight we might be able to get through some of this\nYeah we'll get through and I sure hope so I I have ever accomplished what do you think of Amazon crushing bricks and mortar stores\nYeah you know it takes rushing to the Amazon or you know online retail is about ten percent of total retail if not crushing anything it said in cheers was kind of an anachronism anyway you know the ... the the retailers that are having problems right now\nAre having problems because they're having you know their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\nYou do you think they should have adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure you know toy so that makes me crazy you know I I saw this on a\nYou know but if you follow Toys R us on in the wall Street Journal and in you know it's it's it's actually gone now and now an Mattel is a higher there fourth CEO in four years fourth CEO and four years why\nBecause the CEOs that they hire can't come up with the magic sauce\nTo a reverse the the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls you know what the real problem is\nThat what you have what they say in the yard to read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago that said that uh kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones that they're no longer a ... you know they no longer have any consideration for\nHot wheels were Barbie dolls\nThe real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent pure kids under ten now than there were ten years ago he I think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales decline\nAnd that could be it could be\nCrazy you know I was seriously if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if you're if you're in General Motors or or Amazon\nOr your you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\n... ... ... what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was um\n[noise] I had an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there at the end at a shark cameras there he'll turn was there\nAnd Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation y\nThat said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why a ... you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products are about making room smaller and your lobbies bigger you know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah it is because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but ... you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen Ninety\nEight and I and I said I'm\nSo your your sales are ... are are in going fat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis\nAnd and I said a Hoosier customer\nAnd he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said well we can they don't fit in the product any more you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty\nFour Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said\nThere was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean is it what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion two two and about three years while\nWhy because not paying attention to demographics you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out but if you want to understand where money came from I came from people ... people he will understand\nWell isn't it simple to ... to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\nDrugs are too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic commonsense is not so common both here said that\nYou know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and they say that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat there and they'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large group sits down and I say that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this that Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening to like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you don't you want to tell people I'm sure McDonald's same store sales are off you know ... they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I tell folks are should listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children\nI sit and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you ought to three ends of of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition and no it's it's for French fries\nGarden list of what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food [noise]\n... correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food or it in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food she can't sell you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ...\nWe we have a new generation of called Generation Z\nAnd Generation Z started in a two thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise] but in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we ... we have four million\nOr three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier or\nWhat's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show up the right to your inbox for free with the ... zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com\nBoom boom\nBoom\nYeah absolutely if that does it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it it has to a large degree um the\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that and say people are still people when when you have\nA a large number of people that are consumer or a specific product in a small number of people that consume a specific product the large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the the the the smartphone\nHas a only aged folks in their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives consumption is\nThe number of people in the market period\nThat that that that simple isn't it\nWell ... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it when I'm ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff\nBut if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that because the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers\nAre Twenty years ago in in vast quantities and then the the um [noise]\nUm the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this other group\nBut nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and the fact that they can be for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said pop I you know kids are age you know what she calls herself ... but she's a young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today\nUh the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born uh outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture a where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the\nThe uh a marriage it it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well\nYou know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to ... forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] uh between the ages right now of thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here they were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five\nAn eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not\nA support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nOf superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... where would you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... it's kind of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with a cushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing a cushion yeah well what we did in ... so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age\nAnd and I'm and I'm middle income or our\nOccupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example\nFor a period can't let me ask you this too I mean let's let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people\nOn line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting bang for a dollar a year or you were converting these in the sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that\n[noise] a Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks lives in ... if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry the Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way\nTo a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ...\nA enterprise there is is not good it really is and\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I I really don't\nI don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories uh our sellable\nAnd and what a sucker Berg does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky job so you know the idiot that killed the loving people in the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred um how can we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou telling me I I really don't know that Robert ... in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whacked jobs and um I don't know that that's that's more um

I don't know I I think what he has done his dignify but it is the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou know yeah and you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and ended up like that\nIt exactly George C ... and I I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment\nBecause when I stray outside of demography my position on ... the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot\nView when they you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that that'd be that's what I feel\nRight now are getting yeah kind of ... what's what's going to happen going forward\nIt is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people and a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer the the a position\nOf of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position if you forgot yelling at me\n[laughter] let's go to zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nKen two questions so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more information than a ... and one issue than ... people have a ... you know then\nAnd how the system that slashing explosion basically people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level what what are the size of the sense that if you look at Japan people used to like\nTwenty years ago\nThe people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked at it and then to federal level in Japan for people with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office told him that night or whatever [noise] ah so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question\nWill be about Amazon ah I Know they get criticized for putting out small for prior to send I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even a New York\nFor example I got I got this great gloves the shoveling my neighbors snow and that's the main thing I Need it but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again\n[laughter] ... and so I've just boiling on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead and give us an office again Joe\nJoe\nYou know now that there's for example and explosion that video you know like half with everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize a because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this grand deference to something whether it's just so\nSo much of the nation like you like a kernel of sand on on the ... what good does it do that ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your neighbors are quite a lot of information that we get is it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if um\nIsn't that we get is it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know ... if if I'm a ... a lot of aid that the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you could ask them simple questions about you know\nWhat's going on in the world and they can't answer it [noise] but ... how do you sift through this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nCome to any kind of conclusion unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nAnd in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the interests of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think it's just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\n[noise] we've got a company that ships radios they make radios and they make darn good radio ... company and I I used to get my radios from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's it's amazing that's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier\nYou know ... when when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is\nIs going to do nothing but a grow a you know and that online retail ... will exceed the tempers that word is now is probably go to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees a zillion people um some of which complain about their job there\nI'm more conditions and things like that but I mean there are retired people so there's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere it's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know as you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but it but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah it's a seller

science fit into this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah ... where does science spin it\n[noise] well I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked the awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean raven who are just wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model\nOr how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on and tell us what that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh\nThat I okay I I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking\nMy one way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being\nBut if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location\nIs is not just in one place so I I kind of see that and the and the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and that and and that's kind of how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how\nHow this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book where we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think that's where it comes into you know a different dimensions I think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen\nUh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's a physical form and then there's the spiritual form a that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that\nWe don't really ever die\nAnd in ... you have documented thirty for pure ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kinda wanted to test the waters with the first book\nOkay I have I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first\nOne well sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how deja vu because we'll save a lot of it's for the next book but ah you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not and another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think children are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but\nI think children are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those ah you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I\nI look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor of ... or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light\nOh it was terrible at it and how old's your son\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out yeah he he is\nAnd we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out uh so what was going to happen that I can see was that we were going to get T bone from both sides and just you know at a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuvered through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again I mean I I think that\nI think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and in the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's\nAll just an eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident knows it\nIt it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour\nOh at each other like that you\nKnow that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God but um so it so I I I that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh\nExperience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception pass in the north end to would be island there is a a to bridge fans that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak out for them\nYeah exactly and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff\nAnd then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air it was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in the warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come

you've stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately that is that is also out there in the paranormal world in the spirit world\nThat is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and sure these\nThings as far as I understand have never been human\nNever will be human but they are very real and very scary out out to a couple of them I'm One of them was a a lasts about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school\nA out of out of the University of Washington as living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor on a mattress\nAnd a ... just the night before this incident happened I I had cut across you know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff\nBecause just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway\nI went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she their legend grew by leaps and bounds so I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily looked and there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction\nYeah she had this she had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and\nShe had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen\nAnd I was just staring at her and she had it was either a it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window and she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I and I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site at the foot of my\nThe mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there is like a a call him a fire that was coming up out of the floor and I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream and so I pinch myself I slap myself\nAnd no I was awake in this column with fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones and I'm not sure how long it lasts it it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating I immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh well you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't\nSee it happen and I\nI think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or made her angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing and that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's it that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat\nI could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel and uh nothing that it it so I I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible\nA and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think you're going to I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get to and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the humans but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing a ... there was actually a um I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison in Manheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people are counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft\nSo he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a powerful word locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical but interested so we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know the very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and they got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I I thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and\nAnd uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had\nA little bit of that you know kind of thing\nGoing on competitive thing so I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking\nHead then it would turned out to be a demon had nor did I in fashion and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was\nDoing this this guy took notice of me this instructor then he had the steam analogy book and uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare this guy and he said well that's that's\nVery very interesting you know I'm very interested in in ... he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the ... and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting the end\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there's like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go on freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was there was the intent was good right\nIt was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden\nAnd I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the sing all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard of before I joined the army and that that other incident that I told you about\nAnd uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then it kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in and she immediately so what are you doing and I said well your roommate let me in and then she says what is that\nAnd she pointed to it and I said oh that's the thing I made to scare the you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I have to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she she freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other kind of demonic a incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be somewhat good\nAre these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them and that's when you can have trouble\nYou think you invite them in with the ... board\nOh I I don't play around with we'd you boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nMeat you you you you you hear the nine eleven premonition the new\nYeah uh yeah it was interesting I was in North folk at at the biggest naval base in the world in in Norfolk a naval station or folk with two other professors and we were um I'm experimenting with doing a distance education for the navy and eventually we did get a part of a navy contract to do that but\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease which can include joint pain flu like symptoms fever fatigue or

I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and people who um you know who asked me\nI don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there in ... in there\nIt doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte turns out there in in ... and there are some real people that ... for a\nLiving and I don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living of it you know fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and uh they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of imaging I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but\nUh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nIn there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I I I that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and\nThe things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel I I that I have to do it it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kinda like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm going to write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it\nAnd I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story all have you evaluated force Bruce up it's just a question than just take it away Thomas a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild Hi Thomas my question Bruce\nI'm you spoke about your near accident in the intersection and job comment and question the comment as angels appear to be non denominational they appear at\nChristianity and Islam him there was some voters some towers um and and all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supple light whatever my question to you set\nTo metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nIntersection how can the average man they average woman develop\nCultivate a few well close personal relationship with their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is tangible with absolute certainty\n[noise] well that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often they light lie dormant sure because\nOf you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there are some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have the the accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so things kept happening but now I've\nLearned to through meditation or when I called walking meditation all explaining I'm I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer\nA and I I I Do believe in God and they say prayers even when I'm not meditating but anyway I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me to connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifled but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and what my spirit friends tell me that what they told me to tell my students in the class is to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused but be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\nBruce said go ahead yeah no that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a\nIt's a life lifetime journey and and everybody's at their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and working and now I'm going

I use the quote from a Shakespeare that\nThe uh the hell is empty all the demons are here are all the devils are here you know that so I yeah I use that and that but it and speaking about health I think that's a that's a good topic ah that that's one of the questions that I asked my spirit friends\nUh I said well what happens to the bad people are they they're in the spirit world with you and\nAnd ah they the the answer that I got a was kind of interesting it was well there there are these demonic elements in in the spirit world but they're not necessarily in the same ZIP Code I guess I just\nWaited to describe it uh and I think that what what I understand is that people who have done very very bad things you know on this earth and the physical form a are probably hanging out with those folks and that in that area of the spirit world\nBut they do get a chance to come back and try to make it right and I think that can take a very very long time many probably many incarnations for them to\nTry to to get things right and uh I I think that goes along with with you know a lot of eastern religions to talking about bad karma and that kind of stuff um so that's that's my

the air\nThank you roll and uh I Know what you're going to say Bruce go ahead\nYeah well I think I think everybody has this the the the capability to do it or do you have the inclination or are you willing to take a chance are you willing to also to protect yourself in in the process to realize that there are\nA you know false paths here and there and uh so I I I think it is it is possible for anybody like the the last caller or you know the same type of advice that we can we can cultivate these things and and do so very cautiously and carefully and and slowly\nAnd ah and it is something that and I think that the last caller to ah Thomas a had a good point he said all that it unites this idea of angels unites the whole world and I would I Would go farther and say the paranormal unites all cultures all around the world it's a connection point that we all have\nAnd I think as we learn more and scientists help us more I think that's going to connect us more and and and perhaps bring bring better times for us because we certainly need the help\nWell we sure do don't we Renee is with us in San Francisco first time caller Hi Renee\nHi guy a I'm a Bruce I'm before oh George before I get to my question for both producer asked me to ask you this I think you're on the email I got my mom died earlier this month and I was ... I came on the air and stuff and Julie yes\nAnd I was ... I came on the air and stopped and Julie yes\nAnd so on the email is still there um hopefully you'll get to watch sometimes so we're we're going to put me in touch with a local media was\nOkay I'm ... I wanted to ask your opinion about the peace and um I actually have\nThis is the first probably joy from coast to coast I have an actual recordings of I mean the last about two or three seconds and I want your opinion on display\nHere we go [noise]\nOh\nOh oh oh oh\n\nPretty scary found yeah well it's a weird so what do you think it sounds like like almost like a motorboat doesn't it\nWell the recording was gone and my mom's bedroom um I've got an old fashioned tape recorder and there are ... to ... for about two hours every night\nAnd it's been very quiet this is a quiet neighborhood or will check the outlets to see if there was shorts or any where my sister and I and there's a lot I actually have two of these recordings a father ... if he likes to park it's it's really bizarre off the hook and I can't explain it uh\nBush what about you what do you think about ... BP's well uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I think that\nThey can be very helpfully because the ... the folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones\nUh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location to you know to give you a sign\nThat that they're there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that the third that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very\nSometimes it's kind of sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing\nBut are often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about them anymore\nAnd when do you mean by could be sad [noise] [noise]\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father I did\nA and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nA sense that is that something you'd like to share you know with me why you feel that way and he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either and it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with her father\nWanted to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to see the names or whatever but uh it's so ... and sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know\nWas was that emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy some times in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness or in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I I did not you know relate that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her\nAnd his ... his saying it might clear the air so to speak can maybe create a better connection and and then you know that's what I'm hoping but I I Can't force these things you know just like messages from my you know from my spirit friends they you know they want me to connect\nA and I can't force myself on their loved ones if they're not willing to hear you know the ... what the message is you have to that there's a time and place you know\nVisit stopped backstop rex dot org a public service

kids under ten now than there were ten years ago he I think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined\nYeah could be it could makes me\nCrazy and you know us as seriously if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if you're if you're in General Motors or or Amazon\nOr your ... your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was um [noise]\nHad an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer is in the hospitality industry about two years ago\nAnd everyone was there and at a shark him as their Hilton was there and Google is their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation of why\nA ... you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's\nA ... you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making your room smaller in your lobbies bigger you know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it is all about demographics isn't it\nYeah is it because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but ... you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said I'm\n... so your your sales are ... are are going fat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis\nAnd and I said a Hoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said well we can they don't fit in the product anymore I said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes\nI said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said\nIt was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean is it what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel\nAnd their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographics you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people ... people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nIt look at those trends you find out that you know if there are kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] drugs are too smart [laughter]\nBut but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense is not so common ... said that you know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I say that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat down and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large group six times and I said that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born Nineteen eighty or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you don't you want to tell people I'm sure McDonald's same store sales are off and you know it their all their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children\nI said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is McDonald's famous for its not nutrition do it's it's for French fries\nGarden list of what they tried to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional food\nIt's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nIt in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't sell if you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts [laughter]\nWhat's going on with population trends are are they shifting down to\nIt was you know it's funny you say that uh\nIn Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in two thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million or three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise]\nAh\nWhat's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies the here and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com\nBoom\n\nYeah absolutely if that does it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it it has to a large degree um\nThe [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that and say people are still people when when you have a\nA large number of people that are consumer or a specific product in a small number of people that consume a specific product the large number of people would consume more now I Know that sounds ...\nBut the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce head of the thing that drives consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat that's the that's simple isn't it\nWas ... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it I mean I'm ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal\nJust based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example if you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities and then the the um [noise]\nUm the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their their chief marketing officers\nBecause they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and\nNow he's five and Katie for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age you know what she calls herself ... but she's young woman now ah we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside\nOf the the uh um marriage it it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that though ... whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you effect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to ... forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the\nTo a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies live became Republicans\nIn all cases [laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise]\n[noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThey were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five or sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nOf superimpose over where the heavy lift or should be ... whereas if you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... it's kind of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with the cushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing a cushion\nYeah well what we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have have the have nots but middle age and and I'm and\nI'm middle income or our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income is small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's\nFor that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line\nOr they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially but I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or you were converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that\nFacebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry the Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit\nYou have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really is and\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories\nAre are sellable\nAnd and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay for it so there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky job so you know the idiot that killed eleven people in the Jewish synagogue the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of ... about their hatred um how come we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert dollars and in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whacked jobs and um\nI don't know that that's that's more um a more understanding of the of a of a psych uh graphics than a demographics as far as I'm concerned\nKen what's happening in the housing market both younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\nWhile they're renting because they [laughter] a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt you know\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um a kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old\nThe kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements are throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve and and that they're starting households and getting married you know starting a household is you know it could be an apartment or could be a condo could be anything [noise]\nUm [noise] but we're twenty five million housing unit short of our needs over the course of that generation so housing ... ... ... people ask me all the time he said well if it does seem like housing is all that strong I
