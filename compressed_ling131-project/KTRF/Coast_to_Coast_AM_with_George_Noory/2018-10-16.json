operation\nIt was overwhelming running the day to day and being yellow let's say that's a good job I can get in there about what really connected with the with how passionate Oscar was about ... in a logical it's operation\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time as basically a very powerful allusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting\nEvents all the time from across an incentive to to possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term\nSelect and you can select events under the right circumstances with an exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged thought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will effect would you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception\nTo that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools in the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope\nBut the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day\nHave recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was George\nTalk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you were going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what do they have they didn't have a few good songs\nThey really did they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality\nI said no he said well we'd like you to in a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the you interested and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this I started getting into the monkeys\nAnd I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit\nIncluded this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose from linear time this is why I'm saying that time\nIs not what we think it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seemed to be off in the future so to speak with my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey Dolan that's right who played circus boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nThe yeah they're still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter] and do you know the name Jill ... gallon burger buddy chance I don't ... I wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas mhm\nWith groups of people ... ... which is trying to prove that positive thinking and the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's Ryan and he is totally convinced and he's convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat\nAnd you know just you know positive about things\nThe odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Rhein pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just bury this in the foot notable book with its monumental\nThat when his subjects in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive their scores\nSpiked when they were bored when they were downcast when they were fatigue their scores depth\nAnd it was inevitable and spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it\nYou must really want it you must really wanted if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning and Vegas where the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to mature early identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged\nThought we're talking with Mitch or what's his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership and the miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you and coast to coast day I'm dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\nYou know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book\nI was using their methods I was road testing these things myself and I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research line I write about the methods sweater and I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own\nLife how powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like plus\nUnderstand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George and lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them\nThings that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today I think the universe is ultimately mental that doesn't\nMean that we don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thought change the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brand\nLike human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't have you ... if they do work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try him out that it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work that they feel project one of the things that I read about on the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mine is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity\nBut you're going to experience gravity differently on earth than you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by match the mind is the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're fortunate that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nMetro are going to come back and talk more about your work\nThe miracle club next hour we'll take phone calls questions and miracle stories [noise]\nDon't forget to watch our TV show beyond belief with George Mallory just log onto beyond belief dot com [noise]\n\nGet your hundred dollar shirt free which side visited home\nTitle luck dot com home title luck dot com [noise] twelve\nThirty AM and you're listening to coast to coast [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George George with you along with Mitch Horwitz as we talk about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does he is on the street into this mess you were talking about it briefly but uh I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYou know there is the question you know ... experience in this country about eighty years of serious\nCyclical research serious experiments that the ESP creek admission telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in ESP lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses\nOnce we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence outside the sense said body in open the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like funding and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us and to meet us half way and as I was mentioning in the last segment Jay be running the grid ESP researcher found that\nESP result bike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way get a better job maybe formed a relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic T if there is one behind all of our self help systems you must want with everything and you you must want with passionate intensity and we often ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our conviction\nOurselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want maybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to\nSomehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because\nI Would contend that what you want\nOver time you're going to get do people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus\nThat fuzzy but my urging people might urging to people and this is something list ers can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires\nYour deepest wants to think about this well on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it'd be intimate and see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent\nAre really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually\nHave Mitch how close you echoed the secret that story or is that different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term lava traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying\nIn the previous segment so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because\nYou know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time [noise]\nLinear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that life is intimate everything is happening now\nThere is in and finish to events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us but I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself\nYou may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well [laughter]\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that

mental challenge\nThe thirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple\nAnd any coast listener who emails me I Will send\nThem a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge that for the next thirty days you are going to dedicate your mind to everything that is productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass you make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens\nIt sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult\nAnd if you fall off the horse you don't have to\nRestart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you give thirty days to the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you could write\nTo me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night\nAnd I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays people will visualize a list of people who have written in yes who are on the prayer list for whatever they need a willingness to new job in a selection\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know you sick and stuff like that anyway wonderful how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back\nAfter the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature\nPlays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling so depressed and facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that aren't prescribing they can't direct their mind in a positive way\nThey are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them let's face it there are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance\nBats one prayer comes in that's when ... comes in prayer is an escape hatch from the difficulties\nOf our own psyche from the difficulties of life's circumstances when we can do nothing else we can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray\nIt's an escape hatch from our own psyche\nSo again I don't think we've been put into a cosmic framework the tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds and the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from grief and they can't do the things I'm saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying\nThat's where ... comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the marrow clubs\nIs the one as powerful as many when you are dealing with miracles\nThat's a fascinating question now a lot of people have said\nThat if you get a group of people doing something\nIt can amp up the energy and I believe that's true I absolutely believe that's true I Believe if you get ten people

determine where you end up in life I see this all the time I get hauling myself a heart fast city resident and\nEven though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city when they just can't seem to get ahead and this will lead me to my second question ah people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up in that I wanted to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in school Harry New York we're ...\nNormal for them I I ...\nI was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one\nBecause there was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt crap but these those people Mr Horwitz above\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and yet you say a from a higher exalted background that people should\nKnow but that that they were like many people in society they they were conditioned to stay\nQuiet and it ended up costing there ... there were twenty people killed Eighteen in limbo not one spoke up to say this has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like she does say if they went to their deaths sort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city\nAnd seen my fellow city residents ... many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this stop and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd let me let me ask you because we had the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by to tell somebody to stop what was going on inside the limo ...\nThere are indications that the car was basically used my term coming apart that the uh people were saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other\nOr talk to the car\nWas being calming very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many\nApart the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher middle class of jobs where they should\nHave had the smart the know how justice say I want to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before meat teeth oh that driver would have pulled over no if fans who are being you know I\nI Would have wanted to be in that limo would you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know ... there's a lot to unpack and what keeps saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't\nAbide by that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things I write in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws in forces and I've never including love accident including accidents of birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think\nIs dangerous it's vitally vitally important that everybody act with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates that participates\nIn other things that are going on and it is extremely important to exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces\nSocially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment\nIt is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function\nAnd that is true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that that the mind as extra physical properties that doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything\nAnd every force that occurs or comes into her life but it's one vital tool and my messages use it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment\nAs Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be hazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to Thomas ... in California you know like I'm going to\nOrange thank you for taking my call very upbeat interview here a

died in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd as the caller was describing\nNever taught that your imagination is God and that the God of scripture Old Testament New Testament is really a metaphor for your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing and right now is really coming from within you it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you\nAs you are ultimately rooted in God and that everything\nThat happens to your relationships your experience you're listening experience right here and now is\nReally your emotive thoughts of mental pictures

power the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I give the details in America club is a Harvard a clinical psychologist named Ellen Langer she did a study on hotel maids she found that if she explained to hotel maids the fact that\nTheir jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic ... healthy\nAnd then studied the maids for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing\nShe found the group that had been educated about the aerobics benefits of their jobs\nActually lost weight they didn't do anything differently they were just in that you needed to realize that their jobs or anaerobic Lee and robustly healthy they lost weight and their blood pressure were lowered just because they had been educated about that fact can the mind alone help you lose weight answers apparently yes\nI Love it we're coming back for final questions next on coast to coast they um get\nDaily Show updates right to your inbox for free

talked about his words the miracle club the books available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work much in what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road tested and I treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia it's simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that's familiar to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture\nI made the determination I read about this and the final chapter of the miracle club that once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once\nIf you can actually enter into a relapse meditative state and\nPicture of yourself into the scene going back giving advice to your younger self at whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice\nIt can change your life right here and now in the presence but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience as challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise\nSomething that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson so reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene\nImagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we race adversity we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons sometimes the aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game\nThis is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence you want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch how does it work\nHow does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question the fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select things\nI think as in the particle lab everything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience\nIt as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now\nSo our actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon\nIs the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things the way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state select\nVery carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Barry in Rock Hill

ago or for some reason something just hits me and said George you haven't you have an email to ... you know while getting back on the show and ah you were really receptive in here you are but I've got to tell you a great story you've been on the program a couple of times but a couple of years ago when you were on with me\nYou did an experiment where you had people bring their watches in clocks that were working the whole by the radio in in you did this incredible thing and I got an email that night and for the following week from people who said oh my God\nMy watch is working it hasn't worked in years the funny part about all this says is years later we re rammed part of that program on our weekend shows\nAnd I started getting emails from people after that Shane George my watches are working my clock is working and I'm going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we re run that show a couple of days before that\nThe power of what you did was unbelievable\n[noise] yes you know George ... of people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken watches old clothes and by the way we we can if you wish we can repeat the same experience sure and\nSo people think that he's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves and and they come out of the radio and television but it's really know what I Do eat them simply trigger I'm I'm simply a\nCap at least to the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers um big T. V. shows these actually worked\nStarted my career in a very unusual way I was on the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first big television show and\nThey ended me for two band and I don't know why and what made me do this but I looked into the camera and I said everybody at home going get to school and get broken watches\nI didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen [noise] because everyone wanted to experience this\nPhenomena first of all no one believed that spoons and folks are going to bend and watches we've come alive but they never they list they brought this food they broke broken launches in ... I mean it was messy and then I did my my thing I said one two three work we scream\nThree times one two three work work work and lo and behold\nThey don't want it occurred exactly what happened to you people from all over England way of in Scotland and Ireland [noise] you know very you you didn't have then\nCortland in Ireland [noise] you know very you you didn't have then um you know Twitter in face time and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more my phone was old fashioned black phone and what happened is the BBC's\nElephant system couldn't take\nThe hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain any collapse and the next day of course I was kind of the most\nFamous person in in England the newspapers ran headline stories or we get our puts England in a band so ... years George I thought that I did\nIt I really believe that I admitted in energy that fix broken clerks and bend spoons but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los Angeles\nUCLA and dumped film a mall mhm invited me to her class\nAnd of course I did my my act and I left when I didn't know George is it she secretly recorded me while and I went back from New York two weeks later she took that heavy video\nRemember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four and Seventy five and Seventy six [noise] and she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils student\nWe've broken watches and lo and behold there watches started taking from that video now she calls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix broken watches the scientists\nAnd I said no way what are you talking about I mean New York I didn't even know that you you're doing these experiments and that plenty dawned on me that it's basically I ... I may have to leave I mean in may ... to the power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and clocks all around the world and people just for us to our gas it was amazing I first met retailer back around Nineteen Ninety seven and St Louis he was an invited guest that the Jewish community center do you remember remember that time ...\nYes I Do in a just a great time the place was packed in a I got\nReason formation and had him on my local show when I was the night talk and\nWe've stayed friends ever since watch things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay well it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old [noise] uh I Lived in Cyprus in you could see where we left because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ...\nWhich is the capital of the Cyprus yes and he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms\nAnd most signed the Israeli intelligence services they found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel\nInto ... and into a more safe house oh spies would come into the hotel they would check under you know teacher geology ... but they were really most of the agents that were from Cyprus where\nA flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about ... fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people blown up I I\nI mean ... out of Mormons I've seen everything ah curfews booms exploding a so\nBeing at that age it really changes your life so I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing could breed the British soldier the Turks were killing the Greeks but why all this was going on I was a I befriended their Mossad agent who told me to you know run\nErrands for him he would send me letters we\nShe didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the conflict in the Israeli conflict any out there reason I told you the story is because I already was excited about you know the the then life ... over by yeah and I love\nMovies so [noise] to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel I met Tom go ... who is the\nPrime minister right\n[noise] and she introduced me to Ari Sharon you know these are all your gender rows and that they aren't sure and introduced me to the intelligence community and they started using my ability to\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break in let's come back and pick that up right from there\nBecause you truly ruined the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment where the three Geller the paranormal as the mental us next on coast to coast stay on\nThe coast website is no streamline for mobile devices great news if you're a coup students ... simply want to enjoy our website on your phone was it goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\nYes they introduced me to the head of a most out or they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going\nTo but they basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities\nAnd they picked up the phone in the cold the CIA and he was ... have you CIA scientists quote kitten green who took the call you basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life before we gather\nProduced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it um my website is already gathered dot com and um they asked the CIA to test me\nThey wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how ... the Kurds and in Nineteen Seventy two I left the insurance trade to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and\nI went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition tests [noise] uh and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents\nUm that concerned me and it was amazing the twin you know the press\nTo hold of this story any twin worldwide yes and die in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parody cages are there there was experiments where Cape green held\nA book in his hand it let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phone then and no Twitter and Instagram and I basically drew worked that was in the book and he also worked on that page I'm at their word architectural and I wrote the same word\nIn Palo Alto in California so [noise] yeah that's a venture that I worked very hard to read these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were a United States touring and uh you know when I was watching you on TV and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but then he he you know kind of um ... into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was the head of the American Foreign Relations committee\nFlew me to Geneva we've ambassador max ... a next to me stood Al Gore and\nI was instructed to bum barred usually vote on so\nTo sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty between America and Russia of course that was briefed by by these people in London and um I go to a very close to
