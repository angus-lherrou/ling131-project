investigator as we talk about several things including the psycho man the him which was popularized by are different ... the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing is like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nDrive the way I'm bummed 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell ... you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nYou got that aren't the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person\nIn the ... technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I Would go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most haunted room and I would look around and the two mirrors facing each other [noise] uh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out\nAnd walk around and I'd find a room that had reflection like that and there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy\nMagnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon um there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates has some sort of a portal\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know about consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite puddle of consciousness there\nAnd it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension of course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek\nHighly polished stone but there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and I wasn't ready to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like\nTrance like state known them when you do this properly\nAnd that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this\nYou will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional seemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe\nAnd this being can come up to you and not only speak to you\nBut touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased um other than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her any pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble or the ... thing you know you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a ... you you are well you know you get what you ask for right\nI just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact\nUh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I bought that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with the and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through cycle met him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people chores or is\nIt is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent but I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of\nThem actually had the full on ... dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps and some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Rubin from Santa Barbara California was a song called the winter when\nWho is\nSign up now for ... or ... ... email newsletter needed today at ... am done\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas that area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme\nUFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close\nEncounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continue now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can uh capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way a very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville north\nCarolina the group\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my mystery museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play a an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nIs there is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed in coincidences Josh\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does the George new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut there was not it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced as there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in\nThe state of Nevada and they're good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine\nIf any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it this is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management in safeguarding for classified information are not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise] he's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is that didn't come from them new so if you discovered something\nThat has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix that's where they go down a list of some of the topics that have been a officially explored with\nA list of some of the topics that have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics this thirty eight of them\nAre one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking worm holes in space time gravity waves communication worked drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there is one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and\nA ... July twenty fifth All right so that said now we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ...\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb\nAnd they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at knell is air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force so\nThat said I Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry\nThat is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out and it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you you can download the information for free if you go to Joshua pie Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me George do you think that that is our co incidents that this stuff is winding up the way it is\nNo coincidence is you know that none in the let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and wanted to initiate his Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from\nWhen President Trump announced a space for ... do you think it was the same motives\nI think it was certainly part of it uh well for one thing\nThere's probably pretty good reason to believe that something like a space for its has existed for a long time now [noise] ah I mean we know

than ever\nNow originally to win the Dole was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the ... like in the window or running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest thing creepy his thing about the story of Robert The haunted dollars that he was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene and gene became obsessed\nWith this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very successful man\nA ... had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change his infatuation with the dog I mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some point that was special to you and then there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened\nFor gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean\nHow little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room so are his room was essentially moved to the addict at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house in the house that there are abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a buyer to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look\nUp when you knew that house was was new\nThere ever read see little Robert The do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nI Love that next step let's go to Tyler in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about fourteen years ago it was around uh August\nI spirit who crazy life on to make it to make a brief hours of the around like black ball some areas me and my friends were just hanging out of there and then all of a sudden like this huge\nMe and my friends were just hanging out up there and then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just swept in in the afternoon and like we were watching the ... all of a sudden this super thick fog to that and\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be like deep headlight\nOff in the ... thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading right are at like right after we got to thinking about it we're at and overlook there was no way it could have been like jeep there anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right up on it about two hundred feet away and then they just like broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends ... what the heck was that\nWhat's going on out that way Josh\n... it was it was the wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy sent me a week it might have been from your website or something talking about it and ah it just like connected the dots I've I've been really tried to contact you but we're not trying but you know wanting to talk\nTo you for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it what is that Josh\nWell Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville yet another tar hill and um you know right on in North Carolina everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the ... mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mouth and\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain lead a leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear now I Believe\nThat [noise] if you I mean if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain whites dot com but basically an eye on that website but um\nBut what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more ... ... people seeing UFOs time flips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Marie idioms on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare it to them origins of energy that flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and wouldn't that electricity manifest and interacts at in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball whitening and so you have so much of that which is creepy\nAround western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightening or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've got the information coming up with a Saturday Los Angeles event

I if\nI only will also said yes how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around\nThey shouldn't be there for a while I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise] but um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween\nIs built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan\nAnd say instead of considering October thirty first um some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan believes of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate the saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas\nWe're going to be hearing more stories about this in a probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees\nAnd there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church has said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down\nAnd we punish them we're not going to win any friends instead let's go and sanctify the tree and and then what they are already worshipping will just sort of morphed into our philosophy\nAnd so you see a similar um sin critic sort of an attitude toward Halloween and that's why a gallon\nStand to just sort of\nWe stay in strong\nUnited [noise]\nStand with us in caring for our veterans\n[noise] moving on Russia investigation I'm only a princess as new justice Brett Kavanaugh gets that for his first week on the Supreme Court White House and many Democrats are looking to the mid term elections and beyond ... report\nLeading the administration's charge against Democrats in the wake of the kind of an confirmation on Sunday programs adviser Kellyanne Conway she tells ABC's This week senators Cory Booker Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for starters felt compelled to attack Kavanaugh for their presidential ambitions\nYeah people ... already out there I was planning for ... ... who they were raising money for their presidential can't close the door and a half constantly ...\nBook or in Harris got to raise their profiles because they sit on the Judiciary Committee buck Austin Deanie washing\nThe NTSB it's investigating what they are now saying it's the deadliest automobile accident the UN since two thousand nine ...

have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I

...\nAnd uh he claims to have encountered a lot of weird activity there and he considers that area one of the most to haunted places in Europe he also said that ah the concentration camps are extremely haunted but out of honor and respect for those\nThe dead there he refuses to investigate he's just heard a lot of stories and likewise I decided to leave any stories about the concentration

dramatic story\nEvery chapters rebutting I got to say\nOh I appreciate that the one that moved me the most I found to war and the stories that happened uh [noise] uh in the Pacific theater and again when you're talking about World War two you're talking about a global\nConflicts so these ghost stories crop up literally everywhere\nYeah a ... in Okinawa was that was the one story that stood out for me a and there's a story about a group of civilians who are committed suicide or en masse uh right after the the American invasion of\nOkinawa and just to move like heaven's gate or something like that\nWell it wasn't exactly like that or the story is uh\nThat the Japanese military knew that ... what was kind of the last four ... they had a ... in the Pacific if the Americans took over al ... Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know\nGod Knows what else civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did invade the uh civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and that's you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh\nA story but now it it\nThere are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book is that a group of tourists were had a peace museum near those cliffs and ah they were walking in a field near that that museum\nAnd they heard the sound of what they considered and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a win just pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams to\nThat was pretty moving for me um\nAnother story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and\nHe would Jima it there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably ... to live because they were ... they were in a tunnel system a very intricate tunnel system under the island\nAnd um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels so there's a story that I write about\nThat one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland to any\nUh he gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these are soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan\nTo this or some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the gifts don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman the ship yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is I'm In and I'll tell you a little story from my own family do they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise]\nBut there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise] uh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer and\nIt's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area\nAnd it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps so for example in Nineteen eighty five a\nBunch of people are claimed to have seen this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway\nAnd they saw this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and I you know I think they described it as a a for prop ... engine it look like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they do what they thought yeah\nYou're right but to counter that a lot of these\nPeople that solve this first of all there didn't seem to be a pattern of flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm a somewhat flight mechanics for the for the uh or a half so\nDefinitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar and and there have been other\nWhat they called ghost playing flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust to like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time warp or something right and\nThe reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet\nOff the ground and it was very foggy a you make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri that what it was my mom was still telling that story\nOver and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of it we're going to come back and talk more about haunted World War two next hour you'll share your questions and stories is\nThe ... website is no conveniently optimized for mobile devices if you're a ... you can listen to live in his shoes right on your bones just lose it goes to goes to um dot com on your iPhone or Android\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHey I'm walking back to coast to coast Matthew ... website is linked up the coast to coast am dot com couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more harm to the rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes are strange ... Pearl Harbor is it hot or not\nIt's extremely audited according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nDream Lee haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists\nPeople who are interested in history go there ah we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a tune a mass grave 'em and they'll tell you what a a moving experiences\nAnd again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor\nAnd the ghost stories that had been told about that a famous area or are pretty extensive there's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona\n[noise] ah just briefly and then a\nDuring that time where he left the ship it was attacked and ... and ... and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor\nStanding at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour is uh so that goes story has been\nTold a quite a bit um [noise] excuse me sure there's also a story of a of all of\nOne lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces in them into the picture is a very uh in that went on online throughout\nAnd not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and goes stories at places like the show field barracks and hit them airbase areas that were\nA part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\nAnd one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that\nUh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it and the places so haunted they said\nThat they moved to the sea cue desk which is usually inside\nThe building they now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that ah the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the the Nazi hands or think leader and some incredible things happened to you died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\n[noise] well that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially look\nTo see if I could find the the ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers and Erwin ... has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to [noise] you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him uh I I thought he might be found\nIn North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe\nOn the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind\nA a ...\nArchitecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall or maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia\nPeople claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen it the grades of some of patents a general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they\nClaimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that are between the wars ... along with a few other\nGerman generals traveled on a secret trip to America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuvered through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this\nStory that uh Irwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any and most historians will tell you that it never have happened that the German generals never came here are people who believe these stories say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record\nThat was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people who they are still show up pawns\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway\nIn a in a\nIn London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there\nI found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with\nA ... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle\nAnd I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of Lincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need\nTo witness not I'm not a nude Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z in the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous go stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War\nTwo and disease continue these hunting\n[noise] yeah they do as a matter of\nThe war to end to these continue these hunting\n[noise] yeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the ... the bullet a I Believe there's the story that some of the stories that I found out about that a war from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm\nA custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet\n... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door of the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back the\nSomeone had completed the vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned\nSo that story probably uh not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIn back in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place the pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nYeah I actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent as you point out\nAnd and it's based on my research in my reading about that essentially the whole modern UFO UFO era starts in World War two with some of these sightings of these strange lights and objects that the American flyers used to just call a fu fighters\nAnd what stands out about these reports for me is just the quality of the observers because most of the people who witnessed these foo fighters were trained pilots and their ability to recognize these aircraft shapes and the capabilities of those aircraft\nFamily and co workers to quit make your home and vehicle one hundred percent tobacco free and teach children and adolescents about the health risks of tobacco use and second hand smoke exposure to learn more visit C.

I'm go story is really focused on uh the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in so there there are stories like that there are stories about people getting to a I think in the\nCase of the heck I'm a airbase there's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people um the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh [noise] my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um\n[noise] ah articles or after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost has meant drops that they used to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so\nBad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be at the Seventy seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor I guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left\nFrom the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenty they'd be Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these these stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um\n[noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done its job\nBrian in Indianapolis is with us She's still the Rockies good morning bright hey George how are you a great hope you are to me oh I'm at work again is all you're always working my gosh\nWell you know it's good for my four oh one K. and my retirement\nCursing and when you retire you'll still listen to the coast to coast right\nOh you you do it you know it play list and I got three things to say All right well I'm I'm a friend of Eric truck driving somewhere in Indiana\nEither good guy he is\nA guy if you ever bring your ... and that was a George ... we're working on that\nOK number two now a good story that might be something for the show in a later date that is a World War two are saying they USF Indianapolis the sinking of the ... that\nI think we we just did a show on that uh about a month a couple of weeks ago\nInsure on how we didn't know I tell it was a weekend show oh\nMan but there is a good book out I\nMean these were the ... the seeming to ruin the see the sharks were there it was horrible yeah\nYeah well our main went into the water just sent the ships sunken twelve minutes the twelve hundred men went in the water or know out of twelve hundred men\nEight hundred and eighty eight eight hundred and eighty name when in the water three hundred and went down to ship five days later only three hundred and sixteen now because of new research done came out of the water\nOr there's only ten survivors laugh and I'm In the next July this come in July will be the last reunion here in Indianapolis because it's so hard for them to get around like you said there are nine\nOh yeah absolutely guy\nAnd we always got to remember the greatest generation they sacrifice for us and they did\nUntil but here I I was stationed in Germany are backing aide maybe one eighty three I took a day trip which some some ah friends of mine down to back out concentration camp uh-huh\nAnd you know it was more of a political prisoner camp it wasn't like I had an extermination camp you know like in the other ones were but we were we were able to take pictures and stuff you know in and when we got here when you as soon as you walk in the gate the pressure on you which just the\nNorm you could feel it imagine the of it but we took pictures you know and back then you had thirty five millimeter cameras so you had to get you had to get them developed\nTwo weeks later we were going through the pictures that a couple of friends of mine had taken and just one picture out of the blue in the sequence of pictures was was that was kind of blurry but he took it down between the barracks that are there and\nIndeed at the end of the ... strain silhouette these dream we assume we were ... they were prisoners you you either white\nGrossly grossly prisoners will be back [noise]\nYou ... to ... am dot com logged on\nThree five or visit carnivores dot com C.

T. R. S. [noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George annoyed with you along with Joshua appeal you warn are very expert paranormal investigator as we talk about several things including the psycho man the him which was popularized by a dear friend Raymond Moody the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua pie worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight\nIt's Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to dig into\nThis extremely creepy thing is I come at the mirrors I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs or later all we're going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday and there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nDrive the way I'm dumb 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you okay\n[laughter] well you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank\nGod for that aren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd a number of other people in person\nIn the ... technique um and it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I Would go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most haunting room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and said to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I find a room had reflections like that and there's something about mirrors that magnifies goes\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a near [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know about consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to spry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone but there's something about this idea\nThat when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Would have to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a delusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this\nYou will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional seemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe\nAnd this being can come up to you and it's not only speak to you but touch you\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use\nThis technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother\nThen he would take you through a period of time that could be days where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her and he pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with fat intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble or thing yeah you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a ...\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in\nFront of it and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah\nI think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with the and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through cycle met him experience and I would say that a lot of people ... it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent but I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had\nThe full on ... dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps and some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Rubin from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\nWho is\nSign of now for ... or ... ... email newsletter today at ... am done\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots\nIn the state were incredible footage\nHas been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continue now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can uh capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville north\nCarolina green group\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nIs there is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence ...\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does it Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this\nTime warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and saw the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced as there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of Nevada\nAnd they're good one yes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter\nThat Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings he goes on to say\nGiven the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said and this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise] he's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is that didn't come from them new\nSo if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to desk where they go down a list of some of the topics\nBut there is a an appendix to Des where they go down the list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project in some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes and space time gravity wave communication warped drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and uh you know ... with which July twenty fifth alright so that said now we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville\n... the mainstream media announced\nThat the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat to nail us air force base which\nHappened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force so that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry\nThat is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out and it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you\nYou can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... Warren dot com and scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that now\nYou tell me George do you think that that is our co incidents that this stuff is winding up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in the let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and want to do in this huge his Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from\nWhen President Trump announced a space for ... do you think it was the same motives\nI think it was certainly part of it uh well for one thing\nThere's probably pretty good reason to believe that something like a space for its has existed for a long time now [noise] ah I mean we know how these classified projects work I mean they're classified for Tim Fifteen Twenty years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "08"}
