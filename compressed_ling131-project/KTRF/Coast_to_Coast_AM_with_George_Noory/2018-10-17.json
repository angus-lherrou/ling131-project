president he criticized Donald Trump he said that Trump's attempt to closer relations with Russia would also bring Trump closer to Saudi Arabia's arch enemy Iran a country that the Russian ally\nTrump

pieces with their own saw all on the Saudi\nEmbassy building and asked them both and for the killers we're ... we're close to prince Mohammed bin Salman ... where is all of this information come from a George it doesn't come from American intelligence sources\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word\nUm I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most description and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nLet's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was the veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise]\nYou know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh\nParachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them in did he get that from his combat oh ... ethics yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several\nTimes a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly at one called the purple testament which is actually a lady\nUm during World War two so that was as close to the guts of literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and and several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in that golden age of television wasn't he\nYes he uh he certainly\nWas it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writer so I was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff out and stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know it shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah now with with\nRod he started before he got in the twilight zone he was a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was without question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written\nYou know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and she just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility\nInto the twilight zone and\nGave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to the twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to quit\nBeans prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\n[noise] yeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that is throwing ran into was that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writers job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way and sponsors were getting this way and he it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his\nOwn show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loved fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a a television series that just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know ... it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art it has to what he would say it has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did was to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the issues that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate\nAversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction of all television series\nAnd the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one it made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting a Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means\nSomething is off kilter or something is strange something is you know not quite right\nAnd it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's\nI think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had was called the after dark newsletter\nAnd Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... by shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nAbout what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script um you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over\nFive see that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just it's\nYou know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it and maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah absolutely had heart issues and that's what's on demand you said that brought the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know there's a couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah he run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories\nHa ha so if you do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with a buddy about the twilight zone at the ... with us his book is called the rod Serling is life more than imagination\nAlways on your phone then you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized through mobile users just point your iPhone or Android Browser to coast to coast am dot com and enjoy\nZone ATM twelve thirty gay G are in the river\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick per E.

I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're on an iPad [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much really still waiting for puberty to strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the ... zone\nWhen you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did is you know bumpers and intros and uh [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast on a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're\nReally seeing kilo the in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode or so usually one and executive producer or creator comes onto it said you know but it gets a little uptight\nYeah though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that are on rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around him\nAny talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for Marguerite has every night\nAnd you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or six and seven and nine\nThat's what how did they find you believe for these parts [noise]\nUm well actually the one of the very first lead roles like it was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the course Leishman played by mom and a and the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me and for long distance call and he also directed\nIt is a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know\nJust called me up for in praise of pets\nAre busy guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new\nWell Angela car right now I've just released aren't novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing\nAnd ... and go charge on purpose it's called the devils recruiter and chicken and all the adversary his weapon\nFlow you set yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ... through an ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYour the capability thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat neck I was thinking George so that was great he was a ... I get rod Serling for you on this show you never know [laughter] my yeah my calling from the from the other side what inspired you to write the book about certainly [noise]\nWell I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know ... by the show and and so that started everything [noise] and then really since\nThen I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually I'm dumb this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list\nOf all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced for television or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had you had gaps whatever but\nSo that it never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what she wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it hadn't been commercially released um I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography and his part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into and et cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm probably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that\nWas remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard called it's called noon on doomsday it was broad certainly attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year olds\nIn Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until it's a fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of\nThis story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance\nWell I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these into a interference is came into play and there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that it's so from from\nYou know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nMoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated and he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy in ... he was he agreed with his politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of those Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it's from for it threw him into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit\nThat one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film\nTo introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a documented\nThey needed a documentary they thought you know listen we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was\nYou know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh the the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruit said listen that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before rather so prolific and he was so\nSuch a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had it they had it ready you know ah I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we all see nowadays yeah\nYou know it's [noise] well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that the remake\nOf the twilight zone have been missing is the fact that it's just it was

relation one of the leading causes of syrup mind out before the lady with cardio mobile the FDA clear to personal EKG divide in just Ninety nine dollars to order the cardio dot com K.\nThat would be almost like an escape from your\nDaily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really like that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily\nEthic book could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kinda unfolded into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that the twilight zone and that I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape his tone to it or you know it's funny that you mention that because that is actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery ah in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know step on the news about war and everything else that they go into the night gallery an escape through that so he never really said that about the twilight zone but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well\nAnd it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film all those there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well we'll just as just as well be toilets on movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack London on one of the twilight zones\nHe's starting for twilight zone yeah actually they actually started one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right yeah yeah\nAnd he was terrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone in in three of the episodes that he was and\nHe was he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passes for Trump rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director um jak caught me was so good in that episode this is just so good that the director actually wrote were called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of\nThis guy I just want to keep filming there any way we can make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know we just can't be done at the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something when director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm going to film whatever does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason go ahead sir\nWell where are you folks wherever that President they say why those radios theater and\nThey take some of the old episode when he ran for radio and they also incorporate resident date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when it had to do with\nA nano robots eating up um oil spill in the problem that that could read it and I just thought that it thank you and I think with the ... state\nCool did you know about that neck\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of of of the current one no\nDidn't write ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first sales were to or where to a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS network and the road you know for radio or in college and\nSo yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four\nSo basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you and it was a series of Thirteen um original radio script\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in most in Pacific palisades for most of his a professional career and then he always went back to a if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh\nEvery summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was it a prolonged illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\nHe was fifty years old was any or something\nLike I was fifty yeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypass procedure which was and it was in ... new yeah\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explains you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take advantage of artery from this here and put it here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any of that you know what a cardiac bypassed us but that back then it was so\nNew that that explains the surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were\nShowing 'em up he had another attack on the table and that was pretty much\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHi George ah I got a little trivia but a ride a uh\nI live in central New York from Seventy two Seventy five and I worked on a military page called Santa ...\nWith a quote okay and I would say a big a big arts and all that had nuclear weapons are quite a few actually been on that note uh\nAnyway rods home woods about two or three miles from that bait\nAnd a little town called ... up the road about Mao and a half or two miles with little post office where I where I used to have a ... book and that's where rod you could spend that yeah when he he had a a swimming pool built\nOn its property there a couple of miles away right next to the uh bay or early ... and uh I used to talk to the uh\n[noise] a puppet master it sounds like a one room a purge buffet and I said I I heard rod Serling with Iran during the day comes and once in a while\nAnd I always wish I had met him but I never did but I I think that's where he ... or send that tape cuts to Los Angeles who uh the uh contrived in\nPeriods a TV program and uh\nYou know he's very here already you know as as I say you lived right on Lake ... a an ... an astronaut not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well uh\nWhen his career started the sink a little bit ah he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it it's a word ... in a little cemetery called uh enter lake and right on the lake and much loved that area in its wife up when they first got married they had their honeymoon there\nA on a lake or a ... a her\nRelatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they lived there and they always went back there on a summer to uh write and relax and uh but uh if anything it used to do a little radio a promotion\nFor uh people hey no in the area like a shoe store or whatever might be a store I mean it's kinda cute you'd hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everybody ... which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would have been married things for you know for\nFree for people or people at the college or or local businesses I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his correspond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and if they still exist and\nYou would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad word about Russia certainly do\nYou really can Nick we're going to take a quick

Serling\nShould be available just about anywhere you are the books are sold as they say um you know develop on Amazon now Barnes and noble or they don't have it in the physical store will certainly be a blow to root for you or you can go directly to a university press in Mississippi website um to lump site but if you Google that I'm sure you'll uh you'll come up with it there as well\nTell us about the rod surely memorials foundation\nI'd love to hear that some of I'm a member of the board of directors of the foundation at sea Binghamton New York based charity or that looks out for rod Serling a legacy and and promotes his legacy a in Binghamton or as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we called them certainly fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention A People's common spoken and certainly in your store and Jodie Serling they've both been\nYou know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had pal discussions and radio perform scripts radio scripts performed um\nSo I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community and it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really get a statue built for them and bring him in his home town he loved his hometown a and that should come to come across through\nSeveral twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get a statue of both form they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton\nSo these are all things that were that were working towards\nGosh I would've loved to have them on the show necklace\nUh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so\nTana class a chance or would have been something else what a great interview you would have been oh yeah oh yeah he always was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda ... in Medford, Oregon hello Linda Marie\nMy name is ... and I'm going to kill you\nThat once in a class where my favorite ... episodes also\nThe man and the radio or you're talking about me [laughter]\nNo man had found that ... on the radio in ... in the attic\nAnd the whole damn it played music and shows they'd only he could hear the plastic\nAnd also George and when they came around I Would get crazier for um how you thought up this show tonight I mean after after ... is a is a guess talking about haunted artifacts and they're they're tied in together so many twilight zone episode about highly doubt oh\nAbsolutely I've gotta I've ... I've got to give credit to our executive producer release a lion and Tom Dan how's your our producers for putting that together\nYes and also Nick I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw\n[noise] you know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what toilets and as soon as the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um hitchhikers is one that I I think it was definitely one of the one of the first ones I ever saw\nBut whatever way right yeah going\nMy way and you can have chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing evidence just showing up on the road constantly are on the on a road trip on that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we do you look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just it kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know a rod and Rod's brother Robert\nRobert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time and it was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually a consultant Rob consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they did it ever had anything to do with aviation\nHe went to his brother offer advice on those so he actually got a technical consultant credit on on that particular episode\nNext up we're going to Bradford in the angels camp California Hi Brett heard\nHey Nick was I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling\nA\nTail it involved what they call the ... that was in a capsule um\nThat started with a guy at a bar looking kind of this bonding or whatever and\nAnd uh probably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up\nAnd gave him a ... a ... said call this number and uh so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him this capsule and they said but the the one the one\nCaviar is you cannot drink to get money not drink because he's a message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very and very uncomfortable I'll give you a really bad stomach reaction and so ... was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it said on alcohol it was dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up then if it would just you know crave the alcohol and make you really really sick 'cause it was growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I can tell you that's for sure but it does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not a Serling\nWere so many classic shows though they all had these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at a race track bored and you get the winning horse and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera was called and that's one of the you know your previous caller was talking about a haunted artifacts I mean that camera was an artifact of while it's on you know they they had plenty of those the you know the telephone that only ... movie was talking about they talked to his grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the you know where the Gulf and sort of\nYou know so to speak of that particular episode Marion Rock Hill South Carolina have their\nTheir yard was always a way that they asked where he is a God of our ... our love and the ... and so forth but not right and I got to\nA robot and the ... in the ... for that matter of fact I got to a ... one of my favorite story you tell your or just before do that how 'bout that roster and smoking those nasty sugar at\n[laughter] nah it's unfortunate that really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never never could quite do it\nI used to think either he really loves cigarettes or ... are Jerry roe we're paying ... a lot of them are just ... ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the Senate smoking would knee\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand and it's just it was it was it was attached to them it was ... constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it was the thing\nSure crazy let's go next to too many well in the San Antonio Texas I menu well\nI Do enjoy good morning good morning to you too

were\nFortune alright really come\nFrom the islands and stuff where this was medicine to people okay this was you know part of their culture and it was it was a very small culture so these are very rare\nI Hope they did it with those who died rather than kill someone to do it\nUm I don't know I think I have to think about that but\nAh my hand handle one of those years ago and you know it wasn't

D. V. copies of this big area type and pass them around from city to city to city\nHall right and this book\nWhich has a picture of both Craig's [noise] um [noise] am broke type and the paper copies\nThat they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city century up and not watch than a woman says those are my three such children\nWhile those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from since\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story that's spooky enough but then Craig says Wayne scoping your addict can scrounge around ... takes this is right after he gave me this book\nGo up my addict I live in Eighteen forty house has a few books of its own right\nGo up in his attic and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled but when we bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived\nAnd there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when I was purchased one of the things that was left over in the house was this book ... book of photographs\nOf Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the same three children we opened it up and immediately there's three kids staring right at us we dropped the book\nIndustry [laughter] I mean that's what kind of coincidence is that right that's almost\nLike that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful with what you do\nWell you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques is they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with a weed gee boards and stuff\nAnd I ... I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly it takes because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely ... when when you do your rummaging and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um\nThe the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or I died and the story was that he killed himself and uh I go through there with my buddy\nAnother buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal of this this for a for some lawyers and and and\nWe're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person\nAnd the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission ... period nothing had been cleaned\nAnd years and he had like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made things\nOut of them [noise] um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier [laughter] so I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my buddy won't go up in the addict I Know what's wrong with\nYou because why there's something wrong there\nAre you talking about it because I saw something up there\nI saw something up there I saw go up there\nI said come on man we're working here right it's not time for this right we've got a lot to do he would not go up in the addict by himself grown man\nWe ended up going up in the addict together finishing our photography up there and went downstairs took some more photographs [noise] All right I developed I I\nHad the photographs developed this was just actually no it was a it these were ah this was just the beginning when photographs were a digital but\nThe photographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like or\nBalloons every single photograph in that house had these these weird or sent him none of the photographs before we went up and he had a cat that so I figured I'd spent water on the lens\nAnd I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again\nNo problem just up in that strange addict that's where my buddy says that's what I saw\nVery strange do you find that the the older the object the more possible that it could be a haunted object\nYeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that I just because there's more chance for stories to become attached to an object you know sometimes an object dies made and you know it's a table that was made back in ah\nGeorge Washington's timely and I want\nPeople cried when George Washington died and most of America did those tears went on that table and that table experience that death and and uh you know people ... things into those tables and you know all the all the experience of life\nFor older people falling and breaking news you can be devastating for more tips for making home safer does it also info dot org slash falls a message from the American Academy of orthopedic surgeons and the orthopedic trauma association\nPlease clean the gutters just be careful on the line\nI'm going to take action legal in Canada finally uh Francis Crick tourist state Mike Pompeo also in Turkey this morning after meeting with Saudi leaders Tuesday to find out what happened to a Washington Post reporter believed to have been murdered by Saudi operatives in in stumble meanwhile some members of the Senate are ready to take action when the Kenyan reports\nIt's a rare moment of bipartisanship for the U.S Senate following often costs state parks and fighting but\nThe gas and Jim ... has tested the limit so what will the Senate do what I Would do I know what I'm gonna do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia that Senator Lindsey Graham who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee this guy's got to go to ... speaking such strong terms about Saudi Arabia is especially\nThe guy's gotta go to ... speaking such strong terms about Saudi Arabia is especially biting because gram has been one of that country's strongest defended this guy is a wrecking ball he had just gotten murdered and that conflict in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it I feel he used and abused ...

embassy building an instant bowl and for the killers we're ... we're close to prince Mohammed bin Salman that we're just all of this information come from George it doesn't come from American intelligence sources\nUm I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his strips and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um\nYou know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this\nUm this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper unit that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected\nPretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality\nTo them and did he get that from his combat oh ... as as this yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the toilets on so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually setting lady\nUm during World War two so that was as close to the guts of literally\nRevisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when\nTelevision was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writer so I was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod\nYou know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... Raj wife\nI did not unfortunately no the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before he got in the twilight zone use a writer for other kinds of shows listening\nOh sure sure throughout selling them and some people\nMay not know this but Rob showing was without question the most prestigious writer in television before the toilet so\nHe had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five\nFifty six and fifty seven uh toilets on started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap ah before the twilight zone came out and she just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and\nGave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that Serling ran into was that he ...\nYeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into was that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things it's a ... job to address the issues of his time and every time he tried to address any\nIssue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors were getting this way and it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loves fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of things so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it'll be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a a television series that just had a cool twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of a the artist job the art if it's going to be art\nIt has to do what he would say it has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did want to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the issues or that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue is prejudice um rot had this this innate\nAversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nShe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was wrecking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is\nOff kilter something is strange something is you know not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of rods messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good\nYou know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's\nI think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we have what's called the after dark newsletter\nIn a bread Bree just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nUh what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season period it's just it's you know and and\nAt the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted here's just addicted to it and maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did him in you said that brought the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty other the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well\nFirst of all yeah you're a Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so he knows that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us decorative and take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour and we'll take phone calls with a buddy above the twilight zone and Nick breezy with us his book is called rod Serling is life more than ... than imagination\nAlways on your phone then you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized for mobile users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy\nWorld thirty AM and you're listening to goes goes [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMan will come back to coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick per E. C. with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six hundred wow and I know three of them for example it's a good life\nIn praise of pit long distance call with a guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfields\n[laughter] you know they sure yep\nAnd then as a matter of fact they have a little surprise for you Nicholas really movies with a Billy\nHey George how are you man\nOn the line Nick there you go\nHey bill good to talk to you it's good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] it's better than talking to a dead grandmother so yeah [laughter]\nOkay you can you give us the bad bad man\nOh I'm working for you now okay yeah I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're on the iPad [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much really still waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and then my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd when you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod surely in around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did his you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast on a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and work\nReally sing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to him about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto his said you know but it gets a little uptight yeah though that you know or when Alan's hair [laughter]\nOr whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around them\nDid he talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every\nNight and you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you believe for these parts\n[noise] um well actually the one of the very first\nLead roles I did was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the course Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me and for long distance call and he also directed it's a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pet\nBusy guy and you were you were in ... now what are you doing these days really what's new\nWell Angela car right now I have just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing any time and go charge on purpose it's called the devils river and chicken and all that this Harry his weapon\nFlow you set yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ... through\nAn ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYou than us the capability thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat Nick that I was thinking George so that was great he was a I get rod Serling for you on this show you never know [laughter] you might you might call in from the from the other side what inspired you to write the book about certainly\n[noise] well I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything [noise] and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect\nAll this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually I'm done this type of thing where for example you know there wasn't even really a complete\nA list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced TV or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had you had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it hadn't been commercially released um I Want to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with an a character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into him ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about\nThe sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly\nInfamous in that regard called it's called noon on doomsday it was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who\nYou don't know him until it was a fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of the story\nAnd Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these uh interference is came into play and there have been several studies\nOf this particular show in the evolution that it took from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on TV [laughter] well but none of those studies had\nThe actual first draft and I just luckily found the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with the politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so\nIt really it just yeah it it it's from for it threw him into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William proved that one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and asked to produce a film\nTo introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world\nWhile it was a document that they needed a documentary they thought you know listen we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's\nHere's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days and and and William fruits had listened that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we've said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had it they had it ready\nYou know I I actually don't know exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we'll see nowadays\nYou know it's [noise] well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that the remake of the twilight zone have been missing is the fact that it's just it was black and white the twilight zone is black and white\nIt's just it had an aspect the Fillmore to them so um the war has got to have that black and white uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "17"}
