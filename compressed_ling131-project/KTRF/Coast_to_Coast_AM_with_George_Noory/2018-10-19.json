year for the next day she came in\nBut then I was really carrying a quarter of all my God yeah [laughter] and she said to me she knelt down beside me which was not a good sign and she said you know yesterday you told me to go home my mommy was sick\nShe said how did you notice she said at that very moment my mother had a heart attack\nAnd she was going in an ambulance because she really was calling my name and I was thinking well yeah I heard her but I didn't say anything and for the whole rest of the time I was in kindergarten and talk\nTo them and said hey\nWhat is your daughter Joyce what kind of impressions do you get in order to make those kinds of statements and productions\nWell I mean going back to that that time and I was just a little kid I saw a very clearly see pictures you had a I Can't really describe it but we've all had these experiences were all psychic and I think you know George you are very very psychic yourself you have a June fourth birthday you know what's going on and got to see these pictures and\nYou know something phenomenal it's happening and yet very hard to put into words right George I mean you know that\nIt just happens it happens and I believe God shows these pictures to us so we have clearer inside the six cents and beyond I mean like what's the rest of their brain for I Believe it's for intuitive impressions so\nThe George tell us about your experiences with near death experiences like that [laughter]\nOne of my cousins had drowned so there was like a built in fear of water and my mother and that so you know don't go in the water so I never really learn to swim so\nWhen I was about I guess was eight years old or going through a really difficult time in our family and\nMy sister who was sixteen decided that it was time for us to learn to swim so she took me by the hand I'm ... years old she's sixteen and we go into South Hampton like Long Island which really was no [laughter] what's known to have big\nAreas that were kind of how it you know bottom so we're working out at the lake and step to to under these holes and I just went down and kept going\nDown and you know just going so dark and you say look this is a God and uh

where she was [laughter] but ah I was gone after a while for that and I'm not going to breed and recharge I Can't breathe anymore and I'm just going to drown that's it\nAnd I was down there a long long time I really don't know how long but at a certain point everything grew very light and very beautiful and warm [laughter] pretty good and I had um and I know what you would call that's I guess

an angel underwater is there to help you know what happened\nRight absolutely and she said you know you could come with us if you'd like but it would be better if you stayed here because we have a lot of work for you to do and I say I'm really not interested and at that moment I don't think I had much of a choice because my cousin George who realized my sister and travel came and told us both out and kind of\nAn ceremony furniture with on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut [noise] ah I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to teach me how to swim for one thing that they're probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experience I was with my father's brother my uncle he was the twins\nAnd we're walking in a lake and ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I hit a hole in this lake in just like you don't I went to must have been about eight years old Joyce\nAnd I'm gone I and I thought this is it I'm dead end nowhere back something upon me back up by pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nLike I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times Oh thank you I was at the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very clubs where you're like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh yeah\nI mean is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering over our little building on liberty court and ah I said you know we said to each other but the thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know\nAnd we were we had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when the safe and I had the most the nominal experience and that to my website where I'm\nGoing to happen I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and tell us to go on to the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through they had created a portal\nIn my building and then my apartment and people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park so that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still up in that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida but uh [noise] just like so many incredible things have people would just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people\nSay well if it was just than it was something that just happened but write them down record your dreams as I'm sure your your next guests has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze or you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record with you're experiencing and really happen that way it'll open up more of that consciousness and you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of low yeah sure absolutely\nOkay trucks thank you I had never heard of a thing but uh I had an odd about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did astro travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget it but we don't know about it\nBut this was unusual because I went to um a Tibetan I'm Sorry to say the llama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the baby is born that's the first name he was born on Tuesday says named Tuesday lob sayings\nName is rampant and if you go to his website it's a lot saying rapid dot org\nBut he came to get me and I went on this phenomenal trip to the story and he had a the ability to answer many of my questions now this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over\nSo this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken\nDifferent bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman and it's finally carnation on the earth and the Nineteen eighties so I was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back\nAnd I was home was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out lob sang rampant and I misspelled it slightly put an H on it or it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and I was blown away because she has written\nA maybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to listen\nTo the extreme Lee cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also it just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that\nWe don't really have to die like St your main also was walking and George to believe that that's possible you could take on a further uh incarnation\nI think George many things are possible mhm really do I mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with the\nLiving in dying process and exactly what it is we cross over um it's it's kind of strange for me I mean we've got a picture of the coast to coast team dot com

nine in New York and New Jersey W. A. R. and I was reading a group of people who are on the stage in the meantime because my husband always had a camera and is now it took a picture and he can say in my Web site that this all this\nSpirit energy throughout the whole group and it's really wonderful spirit photography\nAnd that to my website ... Keller dot com so ah the ah experiences very I too have or apps can anyone really explain what or bizarre and have you seen ...\nI Know I I've seen pictures but I mean I haven't seen you know out in the natural state you know into a\nCrazy torch you can only pick it up on camera on the actual pictures but you can see them in person like if there's a celebration when my niece was married there were so many or all the photograph because it was\nThey were just so many people from the other side we're very very happy to be there and they all came out on camera George I wanted to I'm just African you said before about the death process I saw my dad passed away when he took his last breath and it was one of the most phenomenal experiences because\nAll the people in the room saw this ad in the hospital nurses doctors who were there he actually left through his solar collectors and taking huge cloud that just came out he said\nTo me and he said he was leaving and then\nIt took a very big sigh and then just came out of his fellow Plex interim I've taped ceiling\nDid you see the spirit or the ...\nI thought this huge white Mitt to go to the ceiling that's called the classroom

I did a terrible thing when my son was young teens ah and my brother that we're using a way to broaden my living room and I was sitting on a couch watching them\nAnd yeah we were all very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside a team and say oh really that's in my book seven steps\nSo go to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven ... got a birthday coming up I grabbed out\nA way Hey Greg pointed to test your second ability because over the past few decades have met the psychics\nAnd maybe a handful of actually came up with predictions by saying like a you know with with the Toyota Corolla going around that time I got there and all this but the others have worked off of these ... saying oh you should be speaker and this and that so that's\nHow I should be anything but I'm telling you to death I Will say one thing about you\nYou have at the time of your birth at Mars I signed up to grow up you say you love secrets and you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for the\nSolving mysteries I Will say that to you and you know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you got to answer isn't true so great it's just something I can do for you\nYeah I Wonder if you can see predicting wise or something coming up for me career or my income wise change or to make it better [laughter]\nWell you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines I detected work anything like that\nNo I just watch a lot of these uh\nGame shows where you've got to get the words [laughter] that's a good start well how are you starting a new career\nAnd that really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance ah independent contract work for a you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on\nWhat I Would say to you if if you want to find out what's really a sole purpose and I feel that\nIt's discovering mysteries you should really follow it along those lines out just kind of study forensics for bed and when you're not doing construction and you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain it's it's really exciting\nYou're an honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field and honest so thank you saying that Greg\n... everything works out for you speaking of honesty joined should you see something bad will you tell that person\nYou have to be honest but you have to cook it and I don't know what you mean by bad like\nMainly like a national handling accident deaths in action and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid it\nI had a very very very bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen guy told me that\nA bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen guy told me not to go out for twenty four hours and I was all set to stay home but someone came on you're sitting on that we have to go to the beach we have to do that for that or who really horrendous accident guides who will tell you\nAnd if you're not told and you had the accident anyway that it's supposed to happen like you charge I don't believe in accidents\nNo and you know when you look back at the movie the Christmas carol which ... looking in the window with the goes to the future says spirit or these things that will be or could be and that's a that's an interesting question do you think we have the ability to change our destiny\nI think as you raise your consciousness grow and awareness and you grow in truth and love and light and understanding you absolutely can that's why we're here with the it's a school this is one big school charging you know it\nAnd a tearful lessons you too well you know you don't have to experience something really nasty can bypass it\nLet's go to bowl in Wichita, Kansas bowl July twenty eight Nineteen eighty four July twenty eight Nineteen eighty four I bowl welcome to the program\nGeorge George hey that's eighty four is that correct yep okay very good about what's happening well what can we do for you um\nI just ask the question what were you um about three months before I was born\nA my great grandmother was asked me the way from cancer and she told my parents that she had to leave this world to make room for me\nUm and then last year uh me and my fiance had a child and about three months before he was born my grandmother passed away and I was really close to her um I didn't know if that was something that happened very often or if it's like a transfer of energy type thing\nI think if it happens like Ninety nine percent of the time I think it's so brilliant grab a bottle that you've said that because there's always exactly what you said oh you don't always have to have the death but usually cars like one leaves and one comes in and you know what it doesn't have to be the same spirit it usually is not I don't believe it is\nSo ... what you said it's extremely accurate and um for you know born seven twenty eight eighty four is that correct yep\nOkay you have the most time we'll see or a great showman should get out there and let the world know what you're all about I mean but you know like you

beyond job title to learn when you're looking for and then we match people with the right skills and experience to your role\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness too between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it I mean there's good times ... of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams so sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes they kiss goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams and giving us a luring pictures\nA possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich enough will never find the right below the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think that we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these of some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggested that I often you can get your dreams that you could stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with you might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nFor them to you can dream wide awake welder rounds you will speak the language of signs and symbols and good is if you pay attention and sometimes you get more alert to those pop up so the pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel\nMy gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible ways to dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and there's a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor for England who's complaining of the breakfast table oh Robert why do I keep having the same ethic dream when I got to do my medical exams\nThirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation in trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I might of the stories I I picked a sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating that performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin\nFed up with us if they have to keep on making the same offices and not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that dreams come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream to you because you need to get a message in another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe a very strange women who sat down next to me and the plain old reality and mentored me at a certain point that the debt husband or the ...\nHe was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle on the knees creepy story\nAnd he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies both people are that they'll see in their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects I think back to that goes on and I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might be used the dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hit an aspect of yourself\nMaybe your highest self maybe a site the wiser and fight the highest though is the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you\nAnd is probably being run by someone with a slight why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock is awake into doing some course correction is they dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing but some action might be required\nDreams are parcel Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that\nHere's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current understand by kinda understanding I mean the really ready to revive ... understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example a physics tells us science tells us that we

the very helpful in life in terms of creative solutions for things green tool to live with them if you can't find a solution to a problem the oatmeal I\nPut the question to your dreams and see what comes and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes is what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the sense of old is is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the the main thing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver said incidents are citing\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes\nA way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street or go to the park could go and your morning commute\nWithout question in your mind and received the first unusual unexpected thing that enters your field of deception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd or what I Would do when I dropped off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nVisualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh\nSure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tapes and I've got something for you to come on down it work study\nYes wow you're send a Europe be ... and you're manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you'd have Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental ... feedback in his day when people said telegrams\nHe'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with and not mailing it he just ... attention\nOn that person unnoticed walked followed the news said that actually almost didn't celebrate that was the response so you're practicing a game that is an age all day and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already things that are already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they shielded again being reached I mean you are reaching out but nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be

subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then just for some reason they pick it up\nYeah yeah we'll\nWe'll do a little experiments of my groups by which one of those degrees the bell send an image just might be a painting it might be a sculpture it's a non

people a very good at picking up and some people about ascend to another ... this is just a focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where to turn into weaving field of interaction and it goes on and on dreams overtime\nRobert you've talked about synchronous city explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this way make I dreaming once we understand that treat me might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the ... or re I'm standing in a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deeper space we have encounters with people\nWho live in the deepest space including the auditing our ancestors\nThrough synchronous today we often feel the forces and intelligence to live on the other side of those cook in the walls of

again and again and you notice when that is happening as the recurring dream hey slowdown pay attention or what you need to do with this what is the use of those telling you that you need to rectify\nRobert since you've been doing this have we got in the answer on why it works or how it works because we do agree that it does work but now\nYes\nWell it it the the laws attraction has been oversimplified mistakes that by the by the new age but the laws attraction it's always in play the law of attraction means we attract overkill events or encounters according to the energy and the ideas we carry\nIt works at all levels of our lives that never beat a secret it's gone on for very long time\nSo what you notice in the way of sit in front of city and maybe what you remember from

of work for you to do and I said I'm really not interested and at that moment I don't think I had much of a choice because my cousin George who realized my sister and I are in trouble came and told us both out and\nKind of an ceremony furniture with on the beach and I was back in my body but [noise] ah I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many\nThat was really one of the first and I I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my says to teach me how to swim for one thing that they're probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experiences with my father's brother my uncle was a the twins\nAnd we're walking in a lake and uh I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I get a whole in this lake in just like you don't I when I must have been about eight years old Joyce\nAnd I'm gone I and I thought this was it I'm dead end nowhere back something called me back up my pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nCorrect I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times\nOh thank you I was at the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from from the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings\nCame down gosh yeah I mean is there a month and on the day we moved to end jak and I looked up and the world trade\nCenter was towering over our little building on liberty court and ah I said you know we said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\n... we had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when saved and I had the most of the nominal experience and that's my website where um what happened I I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and tell us to go on to the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through with it had created a portal\nIn my building and then my apartment and the people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park so that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Joyce\nNo we saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people were just try to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people say well if it was just and you know something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guests has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record what you're experiencing and will really happen that way it'll open up more of that that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLong long yeah sure absolutely\nTrucks thank you I had never heard of ... but uh I had an odd about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did astro travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before I think we all traveling we just forget or don't we don't know about it\nBut this was unusual because I went to um a Tibetan Lama story\nAt to see the llama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the babies born that's the first name he was born on Tuesday says named Tuesday lob sang ... and if you go to his website it's a lot saying ramp a dot org\nBut he came to get me and I went on this phenomenal trip to his story and he had a the ability to answer many of my questions that this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken\nDifferent bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman and its final incarnation on earth Nineteen eighty so I was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back\nI was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back and as I was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I check before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly put an H on it or it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and that was blown away because she has written\nA maybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to his very delicious\nYeah extremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and they now they must be a doctor but he was also it just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that\nWe don't really have to die like St your main also was locking and George do you believe that that's possible you could take on a further uh incarnation\nI
