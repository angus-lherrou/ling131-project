be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs but um\nOther comes to my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do when I'm not a so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools\nTo increase our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question you know what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either me either\nThat may have nothing in common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart\nTruckers see three arena or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's creative they can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it\nIs really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster\nWe can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't\nFollow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools were developing to do very good things like a dinner by\nCancer or something like that can be used to to trip to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera even if it doesn't that audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device the trucks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile every one and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social\nScore yeah that's right who\nWrecked run a red light you lose the point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you go when if you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you don't um and and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't\nGet any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have that capability of of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced that don't\nAllow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nViolence is every tell them telephone conversations smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just said the technology is at a point where\nThey could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can ah it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that just has to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um\nActions and and and just kind of build a bill obstruct profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to abuse this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb ... whatever\nAnd so with signs this uh on one hand\nIt's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian in Byron in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a suicidal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does is website is his name linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch you\nDial [noise] never missed a detail in the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\n\n\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about a I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe the machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence working the way it does just with chips in the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\n... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nThat does any thinking at all it's it's one reason zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it it goes like this there's this\nThere's this room a that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese\nPeople outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to the library at the library and picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that shouldn't some to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect\nChinese since just perfect and so the question is does does the library and understand Chinese those are those the library and understand Chinese did turn to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that\nIt can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people know they'll librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determining stick\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what it's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not does the computer understand anything or not\nOr by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that that's something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt it is just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers through this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those who may have all this data coming enemies faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago a literal you in in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses\nIt up into it I mean it did everything that that\nImagine a technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than\nThe mirror Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\n[noise] that is an open question or even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nThe first question is do you want them to simulate emotion uh there there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and I\nInterrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had student had kids in Japan and there was a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it\nThe robot learned that if it solved bunch of short people kids without a poor person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kid said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that uh the raising children on fake empathy and you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices this that\nThe noble the machine somehow or does you know we've had their car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's some\nTo a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being\nAnd because there's something special about the human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without a second thought would that it suddenly having nothing effect on people now the question Ken they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel warmth a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nUh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes that sent shaping at er sentient now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nIf they did really well you wouldn't know if a tree fell pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions and even if they claimed they did that could just be in a way a program running\nThat you know the the the program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it won't start making this claim I'm so\nIt's it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines my ring go rogue and they start doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little like Hal from two thousand once the sun\nRight I mean look\nIf it ever happened ah we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart other news just turn them all on and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways a malevolent machine would want\nTo um would be able to inflict harm the the interesting and and so you kind of have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through careless programming the machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all um\nOr kinda machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours and her perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and\nPursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right right now though\nIt doesn't feel like you know I ... I remember when the calculator you know calculators a kid and that was great now I have now the smartphone I don't it doesn't feel like that so long some progression of something that will eventually have a wheel of its own and and I and I want to inflict harm on\nYou know I I honestly line rural and I thought I was something I\nWill but even that's the same thing it's just that is just the machine and and we would have never said well what if you're a slide rule turns on you what if your calculator decides to turn on you then what if your smartphone does so the question or will the

society\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nThe Nineteen eighty\nNinety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year or so you every year you you put a million more workers in and yet that didn't make unemployment go up either it was just new technologies more people are more jobs more well more prosperity\nSo I think the I think anything that multiplies human ability is you know with ... with a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is\nThen you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything uh but our productivity will plummet and so that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you can do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's pick it up by going to Jackson, Tennessee welcome to the program to get started hey Jeffrey go ahead\nOf time to end the phone I Love your show George thank you ... out it or not but I don't want to fly and I've got some ... and fire [laughter] and I tell you what play them back down and show\nYou know saying that don't say that but what what's wrong telling me I\nI Am disabled out on that added fade jobs I think the technology that taking out the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs\nRight I mean look at\nYou you can look at the un unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work I'm almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring\nI'm ... you know technology\nAlways empowers people to be able to do more there's this kind of like an infinite number of jobs you\nYou\nCan make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay and you apply labor and technology to it and you make something work more as age and whatever value you were able to add that to wage\nAnd because technology lets you do more technology increases wages\nIt it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of shake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of facilitating that\nUp because you know it you can say well it's all going to work out on the long run but people live and the short run\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we've we've got to be very mindful of that how we train people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but to turn against technology to say\nSomehow\nKnowing how to be more productive is bad for for people or I think it's a hard case to make\nNow I'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers are there are hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust a driverless truck I just know what are you thinking that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of a myth that uh\nThere's going to be a huge\nA shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes you know without kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up because everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's no future in that because of self driving trucks so\nMost knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're gonna have this this great shortage of them\nAnd even when we get up at the technological hurdles then when we get over the legislative hurdles they they still were only going to be able to do part of of the hall\nStill don't want to see a driverless truck Gees\nOf the hall\nI still don't want to see a driverless truck jeeze put it in Los Angeles traffic it'll go crazy [laughter]\nWell I agree there's a long way for the\nTechnology to go it's interesting that thousands of people\nDie in car accidents and a president but if there's one accident with a driverless car makes\nIt's a huge ... in in in ... Arizona driverless car till the woman\n... yeah a couple of months that makes the news which you know thousands of other people that die in car accidents don't seem to get something happens to\nBe at least ten times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say uh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable they're awful\nIs there anything about AI that you don't like\nNo I mean certainly put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to say well it would be better if\nIf we all woke up within fewer IQ points tomorrow\nSays what study data about the past and use it to project into the future that's the collective memory for the planet for ten thousand years on this planet people learn something a bigger it all out and then they die and its forgotten or maybe they caught somebody and they messed it up now all of a sudden your life experience of my life experience become the data\nTo make somebody else's life better in the future and said no no the technology to say artificial intelligence is that it would be to say intelligence is somehow bad\nWe've got Joe on Long Island New York now Hi Joe go ahead\nFire and a couple of questions about what they had a corporate level you look at Eastman Kodak is competitive chia and Eastman Kodak really doesn't exist and they were you know that high a B. twelve years ago and uh you know that a lot of good research and uh\nThey didn't hold on a so sort of corporate level I think they they had to have made some missteps and then uh if you look at throngs I think uh there's\nAn obvious potential for chaos with them drones fly around trying to walk down the block and a drone flying ... or are they can be weaponized than and flowing into a ... a ballpark law game is on\nSo that's another thing that finally just working remotely I was thinking about that movie late do said veto weather guy with\nThe stall was working on the beach and they had the boy helping them whether it's paid ... ... ... ... you know it's really a reason to be at an off if most of the time and truck to an office one when he could just get on the computer and do the work or on a beach [noise] [noise] wow that's\nThat's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things I'm to the first one you know you mentioned corporations that he's been ... it's very interesting to me the large companies don't\nUsually make these leaps and the of the original down companies uh I used to say only ones left and then it was just listed GE\nAnd so none of the companies around the Dow originally the big powerhouses or they're you know sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt at blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and you mentioned them and I'm\nA Polaroid the same story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on doors right blockbuster ... another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you we're we're gonna have to work that out and you know where where in search early days but uh\nBut yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is going to have to be laws who's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because that's a very real working remote\nYou know I I kind of\nHope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like because you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or you know anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything to require a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the information industry then yeah\nThere was just there was a series of\nCommercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that some day you will you know send a fax from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials kind of seen for the army did\nStay with us by run your just come back and take some final calls in the final chapter next on coast to coast than\nThe ... website is now streamline for mobile devices Greek news if you're a ghost inside a resume the one who enjoy our website on your phone visit goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\nSomething amazing which will taste why my hot actually contract staggering it that this was the thing that you ... ...

like kind of pull the smoke around them I could see their shapes either form\nIt without the smoke they were up there you could not see them\nWithout the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWas amazing gift you still with us Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work is the ghost photographer and our second hour we will\nOpen up the phone line since ...\nSign up now for coastal zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\n\nOoh [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nMm well thirty AM and you're listening to coast to coast [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast we're back with Julie ... her book is called the ghost photographer\nLove the subtitle of course is interesting ... were you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world and make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely\nIt's coming true was\n... it it definitely is coming true if it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of may leave I sit isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nYou comes true it comes to\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did well we'll times\nYeah you know and we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to\nBecause some of the things I encountered um are are strange and some are scary and you know I found at times um and and this is where the Claire sentence really that that gift comes in to comes in very\nHandy um where I can feel\nUm if there is a ... a bad into the an evil entity that is around and I learned something really important for folks to understand um and that is if you if you may find themselves\nWhere they have a ghost in their house or they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have\nTo do is be in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear that they're looking for\nAnd so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominance like dominance like you you can get rid of most of them like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes\nAnd I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma upgrade upbringing I was raised Episcopalian and so I knew the Lord's Prayer\nHadn't used for really long time um\nAnd do the work for you\n... ... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying though I like I started seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I stand ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ...\nUsually all are telling the truth while I was going to say do you think everybody has the capability but you know we're ... we're argue unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to tap into\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen\nFrom the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different\nYou know it perhaps I have you know a ... few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into course media a big way Mm you Google ... when you were experiencing this how come\n[noise]\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right in your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see ... ... a want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how common are uncommon\nSpecifically the photograph did you get the answers [noise] um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about is that really kind of ease my nerves and then [laughter] and then of course I turned to the movies\nAnd there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch and\nDid you do you have and see the which I have not seen you haven't seen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the film which trial and\nI'm\nDavid ... who is the kind of friend advise the producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day and there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son\nWho is um a possess\nAnd he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer so they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of starts shaking\nUm because there was a there was a a\nLike a evil entity that was around and I later talk today about he's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod to find them to know and and I'm like\nOh my gosh that's been happening to me [laughter] so it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this is that all this stuff started happening to me and there was no instruction book\nYou know I was able to identify were ghosts were I was able to figure out how to get them out of a space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans\nProtect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou would not be ... about that ... ... well it was just like the old ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this while he could be medical it could be I mean could\nBe people have woken up it relies basically because they can't lose ... syndrome that then you realize that you know you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of the old ... syndrome where you were basically paralyzed\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of fleet paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you know highly ...\nI I I'm a friend and her on Facebook and I read her book\n... girl I think Rudy is tremendous and expert on the person\nShe absolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven um a friday right um\nHe had Wes Craven um had fleet paralysis and he\nModeled Freddie Krueger based on the ... man because it came to him\nProve or based on the ... man because it came to\nHim that's right and nightmares right [laughter] so what was interesting\nWith Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified trans physical therapist so I\nDo this stuff is a big way now when I started\nTo yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George don't just take a few pictures that goes I mean go all the way\n[laughter] I'm not fond du\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened [noise] and I learned about this stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful rock it is not the prettiest rock and the crystal kingdom but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric\nCharge just sitting on the counter [noise] um it's been studied by the curious and also by Benjamin Franklin said the stone has been a lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been use you know by magicians in those to like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it\nAnd um and I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex is that how it's supposed to send your night stand\nI said I have a feeling that it has a enough of a range to it that will protect you while you sleep\nAnd it did\nIt sure is a big one\n[noise] it helped him to where the only time he had another experiences when he left his rock\nAt home and then I started using it for friends that had kids that had night terrors those kids haven't had night tear sense had another friend sleep paralysis gave her the same thing\nThey're just like you she has only you know what not to be in your hand me dang\nProtect your every day the from the ... the ... sorry and you know\nJournalists mystery hurricanes approach I'm

technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the moral of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet\nWas his vivid presentations on the future of work in life and here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way by run\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs but a\nLot of tough to my website you take to try to figure out if it's your job is at risk and it is a record it's all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTakeover I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do when I'm not a so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think\nWe build these tools to increase our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what the what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common\nVery different things that may have nothing in common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander\nData upstart trucker see three arena or a that would be at a machine that can do everything a person\nCould do it's created it could teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it\nIs really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the ... simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just ... us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy\nOr just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools were developing to do very good things like the ...\nCancer or something like that can be used to to trip to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lips so every camera even if it doesn't add audio can read lips as well as a human I'm\nA ... you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and they get all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social score\nYeah that's right who write run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and if you if you go low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore you don't um and and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws\nAre in place and enforced that don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them are probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is it a point where\nThey could decipher you know what what would that many people are saying and then it can ah it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that decides to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um\n... and and and just kind of build a bill obstruct profiles on people I mean what I'm saying is is it is it is it a potential way to use this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand\nOr a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about balmy something and the computer you know is\nIs set up to pick up code words like bomb ... or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand\nIt's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian in Byron in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have the societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh and now that that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAlright well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called before the age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch your\nDiet [noise] never missed a detail of the show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a new chemical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my pod cast about a I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe the machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way you guys just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\n... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does ... ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nThat does any thinking at all it's it's one lives in zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off or at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere's a thought experiment called the Chinese ruined problem and it's about it it goes like this there's this there's this room\nThat's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese\nPeople outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this trying to the library at the library and picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with that um the spine looks up the second character that since some to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does does the librarian understand\nChinese as it does the library and understand Chinese did to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow they'll librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determining ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything\nAnd so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not does the computer understand anything or not a by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if they can do everything that is that something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt it is just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can I collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all those you know you have all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser came out twenty five years ago are literally in in Ninety three\nAnd oh they did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses\nIt up into I mean it did everything that that\nImagine a technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than the mere Internet which just\nConnected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\n[noise] that is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion a there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and I\nInterrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had student had kids in Japan and there was a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned\nBenefit salt bunch of short people kids without a poor person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuser now ... when I asked later the kids said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that uh the raising children on the ... the ... you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices this that\nThe noble the machine somehow or does you know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being\nUp to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about the human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without a second thought what that is certainly having nothing effect on people now the question Ken they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we [noise] we have we have something called consciousness which is\nThat we experience the world\nWe feel warmth a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nUh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes that ... ... or ... now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm if they did really\nWell you wouldn't know if a tree tall painting you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions and even if they claimed they did that could just be in a way of program running\nYou know the the the program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it once by making this claim I'm so\nIt's it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go road and they started doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little like ... from two thousand once the sun\nRight I mean look\nIf it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart ovens just turn it all on and override their safety protocols I mean there's so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um\nWould be able to inflict harm the the interesting\nAnd and so you kind of have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through cable programming the machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all um\nOr kinda machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours and her perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right right now though\nIt doesn't feel like you know I ... I remember when the calculator you know out of calculators a kid and that was great now I have not a smart phone I don't it doesn't feel like that so long some progression of something that will eventually have the will of its own and and and I want to inflict harm on\nAnd I I Am a suicide rural and I thought I was something like that but even that's the same thing it's just that is just the machine and\nAnd we would have never said well what if you're a slide rule turns on you what if your calculator decides to turn on you then what if your smartphone does so the question or will the machine turn on you we see that in movies a lot right oh yeah and we ... we", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "09"}
