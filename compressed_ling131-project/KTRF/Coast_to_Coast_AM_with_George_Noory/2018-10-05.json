and he was cleaning up vomit every single night his job he couldn't handle it cause and it wasn't because it was scary it was because\nPeople hadn't had a become accustomed to the ... found footage first person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of first of the sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know when it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that in that movie was a that was the director had final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to

thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally how are you know it just it was

Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imaginative felt were these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I think the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom the ... absolutely\nSo so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the more interesting it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the less the shark you see the more effective jobs was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the slight I think it's very easy to over produced core I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it you will protect it you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know it it it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one because it's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it it's ... like a surprise and and if he if he can eat the train coming down the track\nNo one is gonna you know one shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why\nA lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead\nSea grant a ours in ...\nNo I don't let him get grant a are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror film shopping thing\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier\nAround he really is [laughter]\nAnd uh you know and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and ah you know he uh he loves a you know he ... he doesn't like it but he he likes he likes the attention and\nHe likes to paycheck\nTo paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole ... on his back he's putting himself through a you know all of these sort of almost like a chaplain\nWhere it's just it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that horror type feeling for him\nA pet cemetery it things like that\nYeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories I think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what\nI understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story and when you start he just he just keeps writing he he used to just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing a and drinking and writing and ... finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it done\nBut there is NO PLAN going in ... which I think allows for him to ... you know again ... there was no formula striking bit I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think at the same time you know a good director can kind of oil back down to it asked him\nHe'll he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nUh yeah it's interesting because you know I mean well walking away I feel like owns everything ... yes\nAnd now it's kind of come down to the main stream come down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see that [laughter] you know or the rubber ears that you're hanging around your neck or the you know the whatever debt inside the signs\nAnd you know it it's all um it's a ... very commercial um you know I think that uh you know it's a soap opera um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians too I think that um\nYou know modern zombie movies you know I Know ... is the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so out of out and we don't have you know we're we're in the world of you know we're very politically correct world there there are there aren't many a screen\nFeelings that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot down mowed down with a guy and it\nHas no uh we you know a

Oprah and then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and so at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it wasn't just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and aired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making\n'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will\nEventually although the world that's a whole interesting thing to in terms of future science you know we see now that all of this cloning as happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri\nDish he's crazy it's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory and please you're on a chip watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Berliners hogwash life after death does not continue when we die ... ... what\nWell I'm a respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're gonna end up and\nAh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a\nYou know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely fire\nSome event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past are now something that we can really start to grapple with when\nI made the film I interviewed\nA Michael ... who is he's ... he's the skeptic the well known skeptic he's also you know really smart guy very interesting and a nice guy he's a nice guy\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him\nAnd what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that one has mom died he heard her voice and I ...\nYou know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really let you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but\nYeah I heard her voice and I thought well that's an interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting that God jak experience read it that threshold them of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him and I guess they got married in either his house or has\nA now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer and didn't think about it anymore and then months later\nThey were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing and they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one\nMichael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nWell what's important too is a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than a bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I

with Dr Merrill Lynch ... makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and a mirror when would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\n[noise] well there's so many stories that I'm\nJust want him to step birth march or something like\nRight well Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest in trying to document cases um reincarnation and\nAnd trying to document cases of reincarnation and he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a\nSome experience of past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village or in Asia\nAnd he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the\nBiography of this person that the child remembered being and it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological source of evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but\nOr evidence all but it's still compelling\nOur in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers uh I used to change your diapers\nAnd it was kind of shocking for these parents and other sure and\nThen this kid's started remembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school\nAnd so this would be the child's grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up and then ah they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is a kind of um\nSurvival of consciousness or identity after ... death\nBut these instances give us really compelling ideas about what is possible\nBugs it's truly remarkable and remember the true story of the little boy who claimed that he was World War two pilots\nAnd she knew things are both the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody

those ideas and beliefs and form how we live now and you know we know that people believe different things even within a common culture a oh you have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that\nPeople justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of ration rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have\nGood objective data that that then is the evidence that is going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely our special guest Dr Merrill Lynch ... we're talking about the really things dealing with consciousness and the other side how many people who believe in a life after death

that it really depends on what people believe\nOh I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they define God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... while as long as you're eligible to of course\nRight hell and damnation ... can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition\nWhere there isn't a dodge per se but there's this idea of\nYou know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God a that can be a much more\nUm [noise] a beautiful journey toward something that allows us a sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true can very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine\nYou talk about the denial above that so many people ... why do they would lose your freedom\nI think we as human beings are hard wired to be afraid of uncertainty and because we don't definitively know it becomes a scary prospect and I think people will go to great extremes in order

to me when I was seven years old because my two girlfriends were Catholic they went to the Sacred Heart church and um [noise]\nWell I when I was in the Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock masks on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession and I didn't eat also but there was while they were getting dark confession done and uh\nI was sitting there at

Maryland what do you think of mediums\nThere's been some very interesting research some of my colleagues ... and others at the Institute of neurotic sciences we're looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium as getting information that is accurate as compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain\nAnd in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in\nI find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's there's all kinds of industries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nHarry Houdini spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with his dead mother he was successful\n[noise] well I think there's been a lot of fraud there's been a lot in this direction and\nThat doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so you know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of\nFormulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas was George\nEurope hello George junior high or just uh like I was like a lot of the callers call it is a is hotter conscious loose or is it or\nHumanities disturbing because of all our ills and are we going that way is is that going to be the only save your or everything that we do and um that lady before a bottle and she said\nIt was about the heart in mhm I strongly believe that it is just the heart and soul ...\nWhat the soul to do and the soul moves on and I just\nWant to hear her say about that and a thank you George so much I Love the show\nLike joy and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a pump Maryland\nAnd the guy I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question\nI we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity and technology but\nAre more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese and we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language on science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or\nYou know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right\nNow that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders and just not seeing a lot of\nUh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that\nIf we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine a light on that\nI think eventually good beats out over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little tentative about\nThis I Am a little um ...\nYeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we\nCan simply just say yes everything's going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just resort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the ... and the fight\nOr flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions and one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that\nAh we know as people grow older\nOr there is this concern that we lose memory but at the same time we gain wisdom\nSo it's as though we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAlright most school the first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead sure\nTheir village okay thanks\nI just wanted to call because I had this story that I have that uh I was listening to Maryland and uh normally listen to a deal might not ever have anything to say\nYou know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one while I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding\nMy bicycle and I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember\nGetting hit by the truck or remember hitting the ground and then the next memoranda have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I looked down\nAnd I can see a circle of people around me weigh in on the ground and I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely it out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you had something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own ... instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience and it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity to move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the no weather experience the organization of course named after what Michel ... do well big sciences but what is the ... experience me\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the difference between\nThe objective rational reason to kind of discourse and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we know but intuitively we know it and that often can be the

I was cataloging a number of spooky movies and I wanted to go through them with\nYou a lot of big anniversaries\nThere ... there are what is your favorite do your personal favorite all time a horror film\n[noise] it's really tough you know what choice if you ask me every day I'll probably say something else right now I'm kind of falling in love with night in the living dead again just because it's the fiftieth anniversary [noise]\nUm but there's a lot of them that I really enjoy I re I you know so it's tough I I really liked plan nine from outer space it's a guilty pleasure [noise] I really love the blob I Know that sounds corny since I'm the host the blob opposite solid movie I think it's a great movie\nWhat do you think movies like Halloween the ... the shining the conjuring and things like that\nYou know I like those movies I think the shining is actually an excellent ghost story a you know in addition to\nUh being I guess it's not ... I mean I don't know if I classify shining this last year um but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and ... and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right\nYou know these these are these modern horror films are pretty how are you know the ring is Twenty years old you know so um [noise] you know it's a\nYou know a lot of 'em are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween was first Halloween\nIs really a a\nPretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent as kind of like the captain Ahab trying to stop this uh\nYou know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is this a forty year anniversary of the original hollowing imagine it's been that long like gosh\nUh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the thing and asking for me you are in a bunch of other uh [noise] or films a science fiction\nA heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of a scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and the babysitter killer and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story in Hollywood Story kicked him and uh the character became so popular um the mask he's wearing\nThey were trying to come up with a scary math and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek mass and spray painting it white\n[laughter] so That's William Shatner Matt Good Larry I'm I Wonder how we'll feels about that yeah I don't know\nUh but uh you know ... and so what you know the fact that it ... blank you know expression on the mask and and and not\nDeliberately scary face a you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they tried to heart you're talking about the conjuring and some of\n'em there is a family of films there's an a bell which uh you know the original dolled at the Warren a have in their basement full of a\n... object is Iraq at the\nEnd all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they had ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of your Halloween you know and I and and\nIt's just it's it's a you know it\nNo one would trust the stalled for two seconds you know there are like oh what a beautiful dog with the horrific looking right off the bat\nKnow much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that that there are little ... gonna gonna try to possess them or ... birthday\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that star in the early\nThat either a ... to\nShe was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of you know she got kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with the short hair\nRight she ... Frank Sinatra protege\nAnd that is true that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and\nUh you know a William Castle want it to make that movie William Castle was the producer of course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know like emerge Joe and uh you know I always feel with the buzzer is in the seats and the uh uh uh you know all of these uh movie gimmicks\nOf a house on the hill and um you know straight jak\nClassics hold on for a second Mr ... we're in a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nDo have a photo that you think we're ... we're always on the hunt for unique an unusual images for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go to ... am dot com and most over the media button on the upper navigation bar you'll see the submission options [noise]\nAnd we were watching a move my dad and I I think with a lot of these movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies to kind of be with my dad and I he would be in the recliner watching creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner some time\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was the crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand ... this embodied hand\nCrawling by itself and I and and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand that they filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with wires and I'm sure his explanation\nWas dead wrong but but it put it into this perspective of weight there this is fun time they're playing this is a show\nThis is this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something to just the torture me this is this is something for fun\nAnd I think it was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it ... and not just for all of your horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the ... of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror ... is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's fine I I like all of that I like uh I like John or movies I like a you know monsters and\nThen the robots and inches and pirates and all that\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I I I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old and it's too long ago yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill then when the original one with Vincent Price\nRight I mean castles house on how to do and why blind woman and seller man I thought\nHe would really do all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for\nA while when you just wanted me around but I mean all these all these movies he would bring me to you know and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things will\nSure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and ah you know all sorts of thing\nYou know I think that that the curiosity for this a coping a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the speed of a lot of um your your guests on your show who who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\nOf the Texas Chainsaw massacre ... has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre where it's hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie you think there is you think there is and I think the area is why you know and you go back and watch it\nAnd you know it's all still murky sixteen millimeter and it's the chainsaw and the little how weird their house was with all the the mold mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it\nThose were really I think they're really sloppy slap dash you know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered\nKind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because they would know one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho new shower scene you would think yeah you were looking at ... moons every second not one to stabbing did you see in that shower scene\nNo I Know at no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know it's happening but you don't see it\nAt the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of melon that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons and Hitchcock is getting her ... and watching the sound guy you know making all these weird hollow strains down having all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter]\n... doesn't say a word and as you walk out the door he just says her father\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was the ... when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night job he couldn't handle it\nBecause ... and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people hadn't had become accustomed to the ... found footage first person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of first of the sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that in that movie was a that was the director had final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this being that never happened so they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe\nThe ... but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know you go and nowadays I think I'd be hard to do because of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a food everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally how are you know it just it was kind of just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dreams skate which I think one came in the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of who's dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nWith any any ... whenever they\nGo five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of at\nThe bottom of Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the bothered do very much did it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and her child [noise] and uh they are basically kind of dealing\nWith the grief a of a loss of of a spouse or or and a father um and I think it's manifested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know they're like the top hat and kind of ... kind of hair a he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I I didn't really I mean it it didn't I never really believed that Bob are too but that wasn't the part of it I did like\nI didn't like that it seemed like a two hour zone walked commercial where it was just running [laughter] this this allegory for their depression and their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it\n[noise] what is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think if you served you won I think there's two there's two aspects roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to ... you get it right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much by what you want to get back on her to get\nThe other kinda roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in forever want to get on a roller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you your face you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing real things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by itself\nOne of the demographics of movie goers these days I mean I went to a lot when I was younger and I don't go to nearly as many movies now that I'm grown ah I prefer to see them on video or DVDs or you know streaming you know in the comfort of my house\nI think a lot of people are like that it it's interesting because ah you know I I think that [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River
