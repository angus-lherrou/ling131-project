you know they're they're very serious over there are very repressive you notice about these these Middle Eastern countries there are no human rights you know we talk about you know this country waiting banners of human rights and you know wanting to you know a take a stand against\nA various countries because there's human rights abuses by the countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation like China ah and certainly you know the Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia where beheadings and had shopping and chopping off hands and fingers and\nYou name it goes on on a daily basis so that could showcase situation George\nUnfortunately it superseded by the economic ties to the U.S has a inter dependency on Saudi cash\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if\nThe school provides a you know at the end of the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [laughter]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or removed\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted off their student loan ... huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first\nWorld countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today\nIs the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nPeople like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants or so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise]\nUm they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan ... they were going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] sure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn alone and they want the default don't that's right if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's a defining hallmark of uh\nThem when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's the defining hallmark of predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where you know credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they're going to ... percent commission right off\nThe wall so you\nKnow where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they compel to borrow or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nNo explained the process of a default alone in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure does a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates what say they'd they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years uh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment\n[noise] um the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around oh let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars\nWell with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty by hitting the ball or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the\n... what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or so ultimately they will wind pipes um\nHopefully in the government hopes of going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ...\nThis rehabilitation at the end up process they wind up signing for a much a newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan\nSo in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or these agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation\nGet a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... in these agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than ah than alone there remains it's good said I could probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nDo not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate\nThey default again three to four\nTimes and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happened something like eighty percent of the time\nThen the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here in the again we'll take calls next hour with Alan Cohen coast to coast am\nSign of no go zone or read email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and slave the nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens\nMore often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the summons then they become subject\nTo arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams\nAnd and and forced to uh to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWill that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are and just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war as far as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settled on is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know if people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the the government has got you where do they want you on these student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that\nYou know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a part party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse\nUnder Obama Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that where before a bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans\nAnd by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five you know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the ... system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know Donald Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him a et cetera so who would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nI'm a et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in St on collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy wipe out your student debt what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise] some of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away and so um\nSo yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that\nWe've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing this is a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is one sided student loan justice dot org linked up and coast to coast am dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code that make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed a we would immediately see a dramatic\nDecrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nHandling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues well absolutely\nAnd I agree and nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nPromise that the loans or she would be free of interests so why can't we get back to that why should why like Donald Trump said why should the government be making a profit on these loans\nStand together to sort of\nWe stand strong\nUnited [noise]\nStand with us and caring for our veterans charged when we were like illness I only have friends who is the former president of USA

protections encourages predatory lending\nUm and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on her arm and hand crafted dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt as college dead\nOK I already knew to do it how positive but now there's one thing\nThey don't want to mention and that is ... I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three split decision in the saddle case I'm pro life pro gun I'm as far as conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because there's money going into an arm of the state government college\nAnd were being over tax that though it was real and matter of fact the private colleges about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and hear the fang okay we spend a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spend a lot you know even at the conservative we spend a lot of money on those the security but we can only cut those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans\nAnd we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like grief or Venezuelan Georgian and I'm\nAlan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of a large group and I hope\nHe's gotten on an equal talking a little too much you know [laughter] but I I and all of\nThe reason is here's the deal OK\nAlmost ten percent of the total that it's college dead and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we're going to get rid of the lab and get a credit card I'm okay with that line but let me get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the standing with college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I Love I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here if\nI can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look we can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich banker these colleges can get rich on the students looking here that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use the third or I we uh got your point there Gordy Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all his points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq I think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise]\nYou know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to a rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill go with all the debt right now Alan would you just a white dude clean\nWell I Will say that if they had a minimum bankruptcy protection is we're not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge hum settled that debt according to their means\nIf that does not happen then we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWon't let you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large they could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving\nAnd still be able to keep their doors open not have to\nUm that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia\nUm [noise] so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground [laughter] you know and with bankruptcy back in with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other lender has to contend with\nA that would go a long way towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah hey mark go ahead\nWell George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school\nI was on a full scholarship even pay promote books but the federal government makes you go to a student loan counseling so I went and I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over\nFifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student\nLoans and loan balance as a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon ever pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero [noise] um I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Yellen these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college\nAnd some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's\nIt's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that to mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program so they're a bunch of government programs out there that sounds like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness\nThere's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know is that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trained for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan so so that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of\nThat I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nThough the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from\nSallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so uh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students but many many years ago\nNow and we're going to come back and take final goals with you in just a moment here on coast

did what many homeowners do prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in the industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten lines ... dot com was born\nI not only guarantee you love our

about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point uh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars is more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that's money that gets taken away from home purchases or you know business formation\nA auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that didn't prove the economy [noise] ah so certainly is hurting in that respect [noise] uh\nAnd you know it's it's also running in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels typically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um\nThis really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't other wise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy [noise] ah and certainly those people will pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you think Michael thank you very much Georgia now them [noise] um I graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who\nAre at one point three to aloe we're talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I ah got thirty four thousand of the thirty seven thousand but I got you know that I owed\nForgiven wow how'd you do that graduations and\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a hard way um\n[noise] there's something called a you'll finding out what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a courses you cook or a trade the trader Joes yeah and what it is is um if it of course he'll uh the reason they're the situation because they both by ... so if you were\nFrom a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school\nI'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broader so it actually took me from I Would have to say December to ... to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all but given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris email\nUm she surprisingly bonded um but the avenue that I went to go after given the right a cover letter I submitted a pretty much what the ... the political idiotic than I had to pretty much just a put it all out there what I'd gone through ... at the summit transcript that to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that got it reduce I guess right\nAh yes that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the college commercials what being a problem with the life long job placement of quickly\n[noise] so what how I false advertising yeah the exactly so one of the schools shut down there goes your call on the job place there goes your your life long but at the right you got that right or interesting Alan isn't it yeah that\nYou know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point to show there are some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school the fraud you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you an avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of do away and slow walk this ... this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by particularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know\nWhile you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the note and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right\nAnd similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh ... well first of all the loans has been bought and sold so many times that whoever's says they owned a note actually does\nNot owned a note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm ... now there are other\nThere are some avenues that the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than\nAlmost certainly that loan is not\nPrivate loan than almost certainly that alone is not\nLittle suspect little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up alone\nGo to pat and Minneapolis east of the Rockies hyped ... go ahead\nI worked in Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda as is the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers of grandparents parents and still none of them are ever going to get a security\nForum I have a question and I think Justin\nAlright if if I own a house and I have co signed on one of these student loans that does that lean on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans\nYep there goes to the lone first doesn't it well that's a\nYeah that's a great question to her first point yes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now and has been passed yet\nBut I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going their Social Security when they when they reach retirement age uh so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to\nTake away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have one of the things that your family\nHas already where multi generation the grandparents and parents and the kids are never going to get any thoughts as scary but my question is that if you have if you want to help the students and tear up the already you write a check to the school or a money order or other travelers check or whatever\nAnd all and the kid brings yet you know says\nWell here's my transcript for the last semester you want to help me this semester and when you hand over or whatever you're going to help them with don't forget this pet\nGive them a pat on the back and say the whole family is proud of you for being such a great student and such a hard worker\nWell that's part of being a good parent that you've got to do that with a child [noise]\nYeah you know I might also comment on the\nThe the question about coast signing off I urge all parents to never ever co sign on a student loan for a student that's just the worst thing you can do I have seen families just ripped apart by these loans and indeed the lenders including federal government", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to
