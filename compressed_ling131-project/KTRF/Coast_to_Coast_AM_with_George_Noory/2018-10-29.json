massive compendium he put together the titles says it all the monster book he's got every monster you can imagine not Hollywood versions although some of them the Hollywood versions are based on the real things\nYou know I think the the idea of extinctions that might actually not be extinct could actually I applied to a number of these so called trip to says that cold\nAnd then you get into some real weird ones and ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures though yeah maybe ills and troll that were reported long ago are now being reported ETs or aliens and it\nMay be the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you come down on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John ... would particularly and I think one of the things for me at least I mean I've you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books\nBut from my perspective I I kind of type the view that is most important um [noise] revelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be\nMulti connected if you like to connected and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot type creatures on in the same location and timeframe a site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia or in the sixties\nUm when they were ... when they come off from a sane soaring around the the skies both both point pleasant he also had a lot of cancers with men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures that like some of the the we're the ones like my mom and the dog men and things like that I think\nI'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology little creature say can cause I'm not entirely sure that they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing in a flash of light or you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal\nThat night may not they I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads they just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle in vale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got wolf men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into\nA Web well from a regular person you know that\nOf all the the Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never got to reports\nOf someone you know literally shape shift the like in you know American we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that it's the\nCases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThey the locations where they dug men type creatures said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial ... I'm Native American land um some of the ... the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing Bob and just seeing that random\nYou had one a werewolf case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times you remember that yes\nYou know this was um at a British a bicycle royal Airforce help to break and they're actually he was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but it's working out of his age or you can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had I'm an American presence fishers hiked the Cold War\nAnd he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in hair\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot taught trade show was it not put five but just faith a face was very different\nTo hire you were describing nights and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of a big football day\nWith a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise] you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like federal fabricated story like that he was um\nI was able to confess I mean it's a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because he never forgotten about it and it was so if\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right on a pound or the ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and that you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal to skate from the zoo or maybe if somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the uh the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog when\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now I'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the ... he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much ... much larger than regular dogs a base fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if he were to say one of these um find some black dog see what are the main that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm I'm ... and like the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying to find some black dogs in the vicinity\nOf stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum the next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of dogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs that I Would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm ...\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain to the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there and well now you write\nIn fact they become known as ... I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now\nThe occasional sort of ask guy\nAs sky pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is\nThere are these large black cats roaming around the U. K. which simply\nDefy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of his top of Scotland these hundreds every now\nFor that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is if they offer flesh and blood regular animals which not every research with the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nKnow what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween AC DC hell's bells we're right back\n[noise] [noise] do you want your TV show beyond belief with George ... simply go do beyond belief dot com\nMm Mm\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect than there were there\nWere a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise] but it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things\nEnough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services at a window of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's really creepy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the same time to a Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only call like amount in black\nNot many black as that portray bar Will Smith and tell me late Jones in the movies but the real men in black and much weight of a sort of very pile and skiing a\nAnd don't look entirely humans I sort of almost ... ... ... like a lot of paranormal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know whereas in the movies that some secret agents you know of a sacred agency\nBut Terry told me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time\nShe was having lunch with a friend and this creeping mining black time towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy\nAnd she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was ... I was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just gave off this really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nAnd didn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and he kind of\nFull capacity that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the ... men stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature up years\nDifferent forms the different people at different times but it's a harbinger of doomed to come and it predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you'd think it plays out in the ... men so I think the point pleasant and beyond\n[noise] well yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it sort of saturated in witness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia I when people started seeing this\nCreature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act to others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I was saying something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity um the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how men in black and also a lot of other amyloid they unconscious and also reports\nOf women and black turning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called ... or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River in Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal and various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the ... on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have there was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nAmy the cause of the disaster in the ... all that it was sort of a a warning and to tell you that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and bad luck\nAnd that's still very much divides people did buy it upon you know to this day but um but it's also an English equivalent to all be known as the owl mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings into a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John diamonds who's looked into this case deeply\nJohn eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the race or any investigation they all my stories about things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just stop it started doing the research that he realized from his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into he said he quite literally\n... eventually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting these clothes ain't team\nWe had a resurgence of interest in more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking on the part of people who follow this stuff and we should what happened\nWishful thinking on the part of people who follow this sort of stop and we should what happened or whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creature waves in the field of crypto zoology\nYou know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... in Chicago last summer um and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania\nUm there was sudden spots an outbreaks of big activity um some of these like bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side seems for years and then suddenly those you know a two week period\nWe get a lot of things like that and um that kind of um on glee feel like he's sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection\nBetween these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interesting now from my perspective though I didn't really investigate the ... sign things because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good\nResearch into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about it\nAnd it ... to have a number of witnesses to them off in Chicago had suddenly afterwards had almost as ice or prevented dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um [noise]\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization and I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to the tea papal respond to that article um who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these\nI continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um\nAnd I felt somehow that he was connected with our sightings of this my last month type creature so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get old days nuclear\nNightmares as I told him you know from people saying these strange creatures was was kind of you know be disturbing\nUm you know I think you're you're careful not to take too strong of a position in defense of some of these cases\nAre both occasionally you will make a comment that let your readers know where you are on that you will respond to critics who try to just brush it off and I I Know you have to be careful you don't want to commit to these things because you know it's hard it's hard to

abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes government surveillance to all different level so that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect\nIf you can call it a conventional um aspect to the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case\nUh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio village ... claim to be taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd um and for all kinds of purpose if he was taken on board against these will so he was\nAbducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia villa suppose all you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story or which places an entirely different\nSlant on it until now if you read carefully Antonio ... says a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to nine to ... um he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down and he started to feel way it is if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast and he was making a Beijing noise that's kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the roses and debating noise\nSays like the classics and you get with a helicopter now a mine came\nForward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um\nThe the abduction was a fabrication and that's going but he really did evolve a helicopter\nBut they targeted um Bayliss Bowers he was out to the ... lights at night\nAnd they release some sort of aerosol illusion to Jenike aerosol a witch incapacitated in Tokyo on board the helicopter and the the woman was really there and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states\nI doubt um but he is in that sort of at all to state wasn't sure what was going on and that was sort of ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite of the story was but they\n... agencies within ... that might well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad my mission with the fifties while the\nCIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine to what extent they human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I only and we can convince them and anything\nThat was basically what it came down to so metal ... which claimed that um\n[noise] but they they the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just then sat back and white hate to say how much of the story was taken and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was apparent books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets think that that it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there's military or government involvement yeah I mean they should\nWhere it gets confusing if that you know throughout January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO and go as the ... to try and you know um to see how it works on paper doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when the cookie rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling us\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's ah it's actually both because it's so many abduct taste that I spoke with said that they are a number of occasions I'd actually paying visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a\nA traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more but based military personnel were actually approaching the abduct pace quietly\nRequesting that they didn't talk about their experiences and some of Dayton and some of them have but they basically they ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that would be done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um ... they have to pay a good example\nAnd somebody um it was tied to coast to coast Greg bishops I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay the correspondence and the Nineteen nineties a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early\nNineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of a ... I wrote to each other back and forth were open and sailed back down with type\nAnd I'm now they can clearly be done you know aids away without making it looked like the ... I was taught to open a race failed it was almost as if\nWhoever was doing base wants to Greg and college and it's a no that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of luck and intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf ... working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know um are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an alien abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nAnd which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I I think many papers so Shiite them with capital the education's\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side or save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons five Nineteen Seventy one\nJoined the ... stage with thousands of members bits Greek for show updates and to the men's ... dot com slash ... him including ... [noise]\nOne of the things such as being notice and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nWhoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know it may actually\nIt may sort of do research and work for the governments\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that ... I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program\nDesigned to do the work and in most papers and government don't know anything about it at all because he might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more\nDifficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by\nAh by the frame information request so in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously near the homes I bailing out duct tape and and again kind of light with college entering Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em and be able to to respond at that high speed if in in the\nEvent that base that the people flying ... were actually able to\nCatch an abduction going ahead you know in the ... very time\nSomebody who's the tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions Kevin relations black helicopters and we're saying yeah this happens but the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why does stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nPaint the information to themselves unless it leads to be shed and if we daily with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages I'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... and\nI'm bored of the United states and in the latter part to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs\nIn Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas so I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think the violence and intimidation of sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out and it's hard to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up Bob ... in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there is a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ because those guys coming out in December and then there's a book\nThat's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[laughter] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you add rides but one of the things I've always found about ... saw is unlike a lot of people who hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of fuel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference we'd lives off is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago\nHe's hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and however many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't\nYou know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story he doesn't come across like your average hope so [noise] so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nBetween the abductions and paypal who claimed that in some way or another they\nThe the grace of the aisle and grays new to the abductions\nThat somehow they have this deep and sort of sinister and disturbing interest in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this\nThis portion of area fifty while he was working at allegedly and um\nHe said that was the aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um and he speculates on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of obsessive interesting\nIn the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed dastardly by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a veal salt leaving your body\nUm did you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of the of child wave this story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general and and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military\nAnd all and then of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned the last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably as ridiculous topic\nUm in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOr do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they say there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence\nThe government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know ... it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know when uh the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um\nYou know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um survivors of abductees\nYeah that's right now the X. files everything is great nothing black and white I'm ... we'll take one or two calls or east of the Rockies uh John and Virginia Hi John you're on Nicorette burn\nYour genetic thanks for taking my

that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the audience and part of string theory\nBut sure\nUm use me so yes there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern government the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that\nWe have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets of equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together we have\nWe we have we had a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum of the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and San I'm a ...\nA series of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the ... version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which a scientist and struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together and\nThey're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics\nThat um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who\nWho have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts in physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah ... is a great little book um so ... kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nHas quite a cultural lights and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time um you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing the ... wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but habits\nFlat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's complete\nThis you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat\nAnd it's populated by two dimensional objects this object which just linked with some of them were flat square some of them were but circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in ... in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks out on his his ... sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to 'em and\n[noise] the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another\nAnother world and the square says this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere\nRegards to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pull the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and of course the\nThan the square looks around and look down on his flat world that can\nFor the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them so that's where it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension but there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this I Can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... and it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of the higher mentioned so he has put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of your ears and and the story ends with us for flat square languishing in prison I'm hoping that the his readers ... from the readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nLike the idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I mean a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interesting comment on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but up at the square character did have these wild often and even at the stationary experience right where his father that was that there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\nSo happy ever wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise] you know think about the possibility that above hours three spaces are three spatial dimensions that might be others um that we don't see we go through our life\nUm you know thinking about our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the multi bars\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] I'm like I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment uh we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the break\n[noise]\nTo find out where George ... speaking go to the coast to coast am dot com website scroll down to the bottom and clip your just humid or\n\n\n\nSeasons\nChange you know\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure\nAbout anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move and I think not a lot of people would make All right and the situation as he he raises map addict and geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing but there's a way in which the map provide hurting the um to him I think is his\nStory a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nI must say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking\nAbout higher spatial dimensions and he is very\nWhole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he he starts to think you know what if these these mathematical variables and my question you know these higher these higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence\nSomehow um you know what if the math points up to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops\nOf way of what he thought of as a sort of ... educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this into the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um new it involves instead of twenty seven cubes that are labeled\nA all twenty seven are labeled and stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube\nYou know that's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll ah and then he'll rotate the Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative um exercise\nBut he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um\nAnd doing your research but instead he he was doing things like\nPutting this this uh this cue these cubes sets together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and\nHe actually he actually also invented a pitching gotten which was one of the first um um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document in trades I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a free and mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto what do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife for heaven and so on and so\nI'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise] you know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people in the U.S and then\nIn Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book\nChapter seven chapter eight is is cs\nLewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis are learning the same famous\nBritish a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got\nHe's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war and become disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and\nI'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings sort of have an ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talked about in chapter six um which is a chapter\nReally about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimension how that might help explain what happened to him\nUm well let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else higher reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah the drinks are fascinating and um your dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like this with psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who is is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and\nSo you have a people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams\nAnd in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the\nThe spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book\nUh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British aeronautical engineer also was soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too and he starts to have dreams that\nI'm not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams\nAre then seem to happen in real life so he has he has predicted dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future and these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin\nIn as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wandered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In the battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happens you would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so what one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book he has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking\nThis book he has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean he's obviously on an island\nHe recognizes the island as someplace he's already been into streams you notice is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gaffe um that the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French but he's panicked and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something is going to go wrong he knows who's going to be a volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nAnd then a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island of Martinique the French speaking island of Martinique\n'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google him Che W done and\nYou can go go in and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as the country's headed towards a World War one but he he tries to reflect on this he's puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down and then he he\nHe comes across basically of the\nLike people like in ten and people who are talking about the possibility that there is\nHigher dimensions and he's reading Einstein well he's reading about Einstein history and sort of popular science and he he ended up developing a theory\nExercise and healthy eating can help reverse pre diabetes start taking a simple

D. priest leaves I'm asked Christopher here\nIf you've ever read the pre sleeves a sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with a with a lot of young books as out of the wonderful book at the great bucks\nYeah yeah oh oh good so you haven't read it well very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues I been happening is that is with the I guess with the system particularly you seem to still be attached I guess in the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their priest or this is why I suppose\nUh uh toward a about time about the issue is a time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality and then I also the whole perception or not just this time but uh I mean\nI I when I look at things in a quantum level we see that everything is everything is is a sort of waves\nAnd I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies are but but time becomes very essential 'cause it gets the existence of matter that you do an art project or a perception of it anyway so I mean they're just ... anyway you have any comments or thought about the\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book I'm Jamie briefly I talked about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright\nTwentieth century and BBC broadcaster he gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads a hint and who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about um and he comes up and developed his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an adventure\nUm and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of\nFeeling like he's out of time I'm feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dreams either dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember and he he asked the the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and uh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from\nFrom the from the viewing audience the let many of the letters are still extent this still at the\nUniversity of Bradford I'd been there to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of time in my book especially will be a Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty takes us into the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions minimum\nDuring the ... the sports page with thousands of members is great for show updates in connecting with other means ... ... ... am including like but [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise]\nYeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nUh Marcia I just wrote it down I'm going to give that a try thanks for the suggestion taller than reading from the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\nWhat happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was that was going to give me his car and almost some money so [noise]\nDidn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with them with the date on it and everything and it came true like months later [noise]\n[noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like you did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalism and think about your dreams and\nHe believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and their dreams so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood to good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the cool super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons whether it's hailing whether it's neat a loved one or for other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different things how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is that it's not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um [noise] you know sometimes the way that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a\nAs a dimension of consciousness right ... and you definitely have the\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um you know when we talk about that are being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's going in you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies this this\nStarted a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is\nPossible to to access those those dimensions um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into the zone where you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's much more much more mundane unfortunately but um\nBut I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks joke for the call you know you read about the musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCartney has written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his head yeah uh or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many times as well have the same kind of stories\nSome of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from some of them will talk about different there's ... there's different layers of consciousness um so I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon wildcard mind your own with Chris white\nGeorge ... uh I don't think I've ever called in the year so I I usually call in

I'm a Christian that whole to the um Enron and the Eighteen prohibition against us on collecting the spirit world but not contact and\nThen I had a theory that in most cases and and ... I wanted to ask your opinion whether the up and you saw the video up there on on a they your post first time I think that they may be even magnet to make that pops up a pencil or pen shop around but\nI also think it's possible that there are genuine the angels uh parents which\nMay may actual I don't think it's likely spirit but a kidney or maybe extra crossroads eating from another dimension and somehow hold in most cases the dean on our mouth rating\nAnd you have an Eighteen buttons very maybe Eighteen so I'm a stay on the line in case you want to ask you a question or something because this was pretty deep\nWell that's a lot on their Gordon let's let's get her take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there\nThere is a lot there and there's a you know there's a whole all of the\nUh all of the science fiction literature and um and even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions right that that these that these beans\nCame from another dimension I'm so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of American Pop culture about um other dimensional or other dimensional beings um you also raise the question of you\nKnow what is the relationship of UFOs and extra traditional classroom beings to ghosts and spirits or demons and that that's also a question that people raise 'em and I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that\nFrom just some of my reading and and not literature\nAnd here I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know ...\nStuff on on communion or he actually has a new book I'm I'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and go on the other so he I think Whitley it's come to come to believe that there's there's a connection on and it sounds like you've come to believe that as well that there's a\nThere's a connection somehow you know maybe departed spirits hum are aliens or aliens are depart spirits\nAnd do we think we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program or Chris and looking for his actions and you'd be amazed how many scientists or\nA behind the scenes are interested in those kinds of subjects as well whether there's a connection yeah looking at the idea of the universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course that wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out we're just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse\nIdea right the multiverse ideas that there's you know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and\nYou know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream I'm I prefer to conventional wisdom now among cosmologist and theoretical physicists that that there is a multi birth you know which is um and that's another fantastic scientific concept that there's not proof for\nThere's really not proof of that idea but it it is it has become a kind of an appealing idea to scientists\nAnd then you mentioned the sort of\nMany infinite parallel universes of many worlds theory or the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics another idea that we live in a complex and constantly branching universe\nWhere there's multiple copies infinite copies of all of us doing all kinds of other things right and in parallel world so I I Do try to introduce some of those other theories on towards the end of the book as well but it's it's an

'cause I'm not entirely sure they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of say a big foot by Michigan a flash of light or you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we daily with something that's perceived as an animal\nThat night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm\nSomeone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads they just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the side of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep gestures are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or ... or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot of I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports\nOf someone you know literally shape shift the liking Americans have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThese cases that I Do have what I found is that\nThey the locations where they dug man type creatures have said is in trade it very often these\nAncient burial Maryland's I'm Native American land um some of the ... the mysterious mounds in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one a werewolf case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times you remember that yes\nYeah they saw some other British a bicycle royal Airforce ... and uh actually it was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but it's working a Elvis age have already come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had I'm an American presence there was a hike to the Cold War\nAnd he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ... and ... sort of kind of look like a big foot ... was it not for five but just face to face was very different\nTo hire you were describing nights and it was more like a long muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine took a big party\nWith the with the German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that'll fabricated story like that he was um\nI was able to confess I mean it's a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because he never forgotten about it and it was so it\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right out of town to the ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the zoo or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the development\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now\nI'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the basket veils he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend I'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k.\nUm that typically are much ... much larger than regular dogs on my face fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if he were to say one of these um find some black dogs would automate that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm I'm at and light that dog my entire often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards I'm Pisces like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying the find some black dogs in the vicinity\nOf stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second but then what literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirits of dogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine a fight with the\nSpirits of of that dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there and well now you\nWrite in fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now\nThe occasional sort of ask I\nAsk I pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly\nThe problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the U. K. which simply\nDefy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of his top of Scotland these hundreds every now\nFor that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is a ... a flesh and blood regular animals which not every research with the phenomenon thinks that's the case\nYou know what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween a CD the hell's bells we'll be right back\n[noise] do you want your TV show beyond belief with George Nouri simply go to beyond belief dot com\nMm Mm\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press and one of them even spoke to the local police or the [laughter] I don't really know what the police could have done about it but it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that's you know you have the spice of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services and the windshield of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only call like I'm Out in black\nAnd not the men in black has that been portrayed by Will Smith and told me lead Jones in the movies\nBut the rail men in black and much weight and that sort of very ... and eight\nAnd don't and look entirely human they sort of almost look ... found pile like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies ... secret agents of a sacred agency but Terry telling me the story of hands Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time\nShe was having lunch with a friend and this creeping manning black time tours and sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm\nBasically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy\nAnd she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like the money was ... was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of ... old black suits and just gave off these really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the things that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFull costume that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat they said we'll things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for summer\nYou know the man stories and at least the movie version of more men is that this creature up years\nDifferent forms to different people different times but as a harbinger of doomed come than it predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think it ... it plays out in the ... men so I think the point pleasant and beyond\n[noise] well yeah I mean there's no doubt that it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act till others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of we had a UFO activity um the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how money in black and also a lot of of the amyloid band cancers and also reports\nOf women and black turning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on the heights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called the or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River an Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal and various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the ... on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have there was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nThat caused the disaster the deaths all that it was sort of um a warning and to tell you that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and an ... look\nI'm that's still very much divides people divided upon you know to this day but um but it's also an English equivalent to all be known as the our mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings in a a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John diamonds who's looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the\nRace or any investigation they all my stories about things that happened to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized from his perspective\nBut it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into he said he quite literally ... eventually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting these close maintain\nA resurgence of interest in more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking the part of the people who follow this sort of stop and we should what happened or\nThere it is wishful thinking on the part of people who follow this sort of stop and we should what happened or whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange\nCreature waves in the field of crypto zoology\nYou know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... in Chicago last summer um and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania\nUm there were certain spots and outbreaks of big activity um some of these like bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side things for years and then suddenly those you know a two week period\nAnd we get a lot of things like that and um that kind of I'm I'm really feel like he's sort of power leveled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection\nBetween these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interested\nNow from my perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... sign things because um there are a lot of people um who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaping two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about it\nAnd it ... to have a number of witnesses to them off in Chicago had suddenly afterwards had almost as ice or prevented dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um [noise]\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization and I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to the tea papal respond to that article um who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these\nI continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um\nAnd I felt somehow that he was connected with our sightings of this my last month type creature so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get old days nuclear\nNightmares as I told him you know from paper saying these strange creatures was was kind of you know be disturbing\nUm you know and I think you're a you're careful not to take too strong of a position in defense of some of these cases are but occasionally you will make a comment that let your readers know where you are on that you will respond to\nCritics who try to just brush it off and I I Know you have to be careful you don't want to commit to any of these things because you know it's hard it's hard to prove it one way or another right\n[noise] well yeah it is hard to prove anything but I mean you know I've ... I've spoken to probably hundreds and hundreds of witnesses to strange creatures all over the years and what I found is that the vast majority of them\nDo come across as paying like overwhelmingly down to a rational now of course it fails I bet you're always going to get someone who\nYou know how Cheryl tries to ... just to find to say still just some crazy person buts what I found it to the vast majority to come across like regular", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "29"}
