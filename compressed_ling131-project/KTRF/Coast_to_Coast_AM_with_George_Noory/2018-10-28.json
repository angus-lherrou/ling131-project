is that a time of year when you could probably get away with it in Roswell New Mexico so you know start north get their actual aliens walking round rouse well\nThey might be able to blend in really well with the Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about the coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn 'em to a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout the the Salem witch trials and how historians had been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America\nIs another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we're not competing again he\nExtended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBut let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah uh it it would all be over now the boss to be going home with a trophy\nUp at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you are following the game or you should to also go back and listen to it through coast insider\nIt was really interesting and I kind of a host he's afraid that the guest Michael deal in the science writer former professor at Harvard and the guy who used to be on good morning America regularly appear on ABC shows\nA ... he he probably could have gotten a bigger audience had not been for that exciting\nUm and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would ... would become the new Roswell\nI'm kind of happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\n... getting all so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time but this is the time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do it if if Ross was kind\nOf Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um let people go out here grade are which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn me a ... a coordinated together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it is a great opportunity or people that go out and really try to experience aren't about hunter feeling as getting our\nNFL like you're a crash in going at it other people go out here by them I think are a wake up and happiness or bottom rare and\nAnd it it out and mile from Roswell made a whole a great place to argue and things like that but again I'm more more of the stars and the power of people get dressed up and\nThey feel that a become one or they may come down and I you know\nThat that area there is something here that ran that and they're trying to connect with an especially around Halloween and during the year after after our own July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA new position I'll be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to ... go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nThey can go to Iraq or on international year from her and her ... and ... that great opportunity to really dive and care for a car and very much a part of the crash on deck and early ... check out the library right there you are very ... and ... you probably\nAre in agreement that we have a record store I got it done by a medical researcher we've been going on\nWe have a U.S a tour I got it done by a medical researcher he's been doing research on the crash and your first for over twenty ... years and he will take you to be exact locations\nA painting\nOf the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nFor the first time last year that broke or family where the crash occurred allegedly they will take it out to the crash site where a knack for South rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of things that I Would definitely recommend that people checked out\nAnd I'm near their treachery and so\nOkay so plenty to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do but I mean there are some people still are kind of on the and until we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nOr we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the year from using a the locals know who the tourists are because\nAt that her and you will come and walk down our main street and go into the area that wind which is a great story I bring your ... take pictures stock in the rock a visitor center we have to and leaving alien that we'd decorate our economy especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] puts on a big festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community that um these they're about six foot alien or not people not to take pictures with and and you'll hear the story of you know are employers in mind his name is ... and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nAnd with local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors\nAt a UFO museum and Research Center\nTiny good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you Anita and if I'm if I'm driving through town and get a chance I'll say hello okay yes please thank you\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell\nNew Mexico a season with the which GW Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you read this great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this is second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary plays in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts\nThey do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October is that about right\n[noise] yeah that's about right or the city of about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month it's it's in the quarter million though the massive amount of people for the small city to have a within the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this was one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drilled down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I it you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that uh that that there are other places around the world outside of the Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that sell more than the first ever which trial wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America you'll\nVictim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries but we don't really\nHear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is and it's honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still winter being being asked you for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course is that all the seasonal planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that she's with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I like the rub zombie story there\nIn the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either coming up next our one coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nC. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five well thirty AM\nAnd you're listening to coast to coast [noise]\n\n\nSo er Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's which memorial to the more than ... victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America\nBut its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter]\nOh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons\nWhy kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held onto it over the course about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a ... you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy real killer tree the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now they got through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas boat basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to film village for sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is that live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... than it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determined which has like a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah I guess this is important and I this is great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims a murder that they were executed\nAnd they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibility is something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for board so to speak\nAnd part of it that's less connected to the tragedy with more just around you know the identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] he is so they\nThey don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really the blood over into longer than that so if you want to experience Salem\nDon't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year\nJoined the sound that Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um I talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes of freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again the good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras [noise]\nBut ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October it's cold is which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same festivities educated Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nDefinitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts families to him right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right on the part of it but this is within the party\n[noise] okay so you you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean it Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem Village ... are there are a lot of haunted houses or where there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trials [noise]\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off\nAll kinds of algae around that is it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting idea of innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the film which trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and ... and ... and ghost everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people\nOver the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in ... um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other five the executions you everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time out there are two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders the end of the things\nAnd I've never had an experience so my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah what's the what's the best the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims\nHappened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual store co vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of follow you around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape prone to jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials it's all that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like bust his answer something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police that station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know\nScape as a PR move for his next big event so it wasn't down there doing more of a say on busing but if you're doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the family the city in complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents\nAnd the art museum and the witches and the which has had this really strange position where they call them some of which is ... and you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of you know\nThese quote unquote say panic which is from colonial times that never existed plus I have to deal with this kind of caricature of a witch Halloween which on all the street signs and the sides of the cop cars and the fire engines better you know present which is as monsters basically right you know\nTo support our

I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nWhenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one dust whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe witches of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil and the words of Clint Eastwood\nIn one of my favorite movies uh unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killed demand take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\nTake away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have [noise] so even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories or cold and why I treat the subject of murder personally\nThe woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass belt was the first cousin of my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her\nEven though I never met her she was gone years before I was born\nMy dissertation or ... or at Arizona State on the line between solid crime journalism and the multi platform genre we called true crime was designed to establish the distinct and unique conventions\nThe harder to operate on so I moved to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet I wind up in Manhattan I Know very well and I\nGo oh totally cool so so I packed\nThe book and then I got the call like four days later and always good to go like uh the book is the head of data overnight me a book so that I had it in my hand but unfortunately loves them and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax that I Do not want to miss with the true story of the the uh the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nCarter is my daughter read daughter or my daughter she uh she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out I didn't really pay that worked\nOut well it probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you're getting for it and the fact that you very likely cracked this case\nUm is very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the bus or the red Sox win tonight and and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to cancel out a little bit of torture [laughter] to keep all we have to be going well over here [noise] ah\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] oh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the buck Straggler along with hundreds of other crime cases in a book I wrote\nMaybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or a ... I did um [noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took him in the box and stronger case and publish some theories about it which may be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I ... I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in as well but the men's on the train is a story it is it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said is is there any story\nToo old to be told\nA when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said what which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been incorrectly adjudicated\nWhich we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also it's true all the time that that there'll be there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a ... a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\n[noise] they write their their tip while they're there for people who were actually lovely executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to them I Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed nonetheless\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob\nWho are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by right from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that was ...\nNinety eight but last year we are pretty sure that was him was Nineteen well although there was a ... there's an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it's ...\n[noise] so I looked in the I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois they saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house\nI'm ... and ... the mayor in around the turn of the century in ... one of the first mayors of the town\nI'm was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and and ... the the belief was always it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found\nUm but it and what I was reading if not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we haven't we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA sick signature characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about Ken scratching 'cause I'm writing down\n[laughter] when a murder or a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[laughter] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and bucket right there is a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certain him\nA Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket American percent bucket right and I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each pocket multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with as a hundred and one\nThat actually includes the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state a lot for crimes they committed and the the or somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims guy okay that's right All right so ... gets through a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\n... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's em oh\nWell this is a long this could be a wrong answer I'm not a long awaited person those could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often of family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small town too small to have a police department [noise]\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an axe the\nAx is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they actually the ban then at the scene of the crime\nOr handle is washed her fingerprints\nThe house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are locked the or or\nSomething is jammed in the door [noise] ah the ad off any move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and would find a a a huge blood stain in one room I Am a bloody trail and the bodies in another room the um [noise]\nLet me let me cause you let me pause you right there and we'll be back for the rest of the similarities between these stories demand from the tree and you're just learning about America's most elusive serial killer that you've never heard of next coast to coast am Disney in\nThere for the Martha what's that\nI sort of like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that the um the ah the crime you normally occurred on Sunday nights they used occurred on the weekends up until Nineteen ten the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was ballgame or one of the primary industry has was logging\nThe doors are doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that the um [noise] there's all there are clear geographic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland or so that that would be a link between them\nThe uh uh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house term they were way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light\nTake the chairman a off the lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would um put poet blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from flying back and heading heading him as he was\n... someone [noise] the ah a coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior\n[noise] uh yeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new and that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin it was it was in St for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed the bullet or another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... what are his first crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not a\nI'm not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around it\nYeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I knew I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder and American history or the first or something [noise] murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that ... in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing gun in secret fear because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never fully known and\nAre not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be the worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled them this\nThis person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah any fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely\nNobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without homes much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims Sprite or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is is he's called any we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but then there's a couple of good football games I got distracted dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody in the president is him for us to just assume that there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks\nBecause there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were in a very primitive stage\nAnd because that's true information had very little ... of this type had little ability to spread from town to town by Nineteen twelve the national wire services were\nWere organized at a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years in October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden\nThere was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime ... Iowa in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that even though you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe er er and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies and you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they had the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man Howard little who was later executed for it and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speech to\nThe lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the insurgency of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing of police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national uh investigative bodies of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces us also\nThe country at the same time that's exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and\nYou know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm [laughter] I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to\nTo realize how backward and ineffective our judicial system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how premiere the the investigative process war at the time of these crimes\nAnd what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nUh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew\nThat if you committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if you committed a crime in a small town that had no police force\nFirst of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... and ... this was a demon I'll even throw in another piece even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I ... I wrote about this a little bit in in the\nIn a true crime book and he had written about this murder that happened in my family in that the the ... the jury's ... the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is who do each it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course you look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have to see a science that when the expecting\nThe forensics to be presented to the Lincoln is on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they ... they they were resistant to it\nWell and there was this until because they didn't grow up with it the uh uh when in Eighteen Ninety eight of the time in the bathroom transfer murder a fingerprint or I Know him from a forensic standpoint\nUh it had been going since the ancient world but that by it'd been by some people that the rich patterns on your fingers were unique and people in a in ancient Egypt even would feel they're a letter with putting their from predators wax\nBecause every mindful action entertain them all ...\nAnd they'd all I\nHow you can join the American you'd call at ... dot org together we can do beautiful [noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting\nThe sanctions or Saturday for the victims of a shooting at a Pittsburgh Don earlier in the day the gathering included prayers in thinking and memory and the eleven people kill the\nPresident felt an obligation to carry on with the Saturday schedule speaking to a future farmers of America and to make America great again rally\nWe don't want to let people that are evil change our lives\nBefore heading to the rally he pledged to tone down the rhetoric his crowds love with one exception\nAnd I'd have a much different zone frankly if the press was even hand to the press was fair I'd have a much different tone all the time the\nPresident pledged to go to Pittsburgh soon ...

there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\n[noise] an an item of Jim nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nA dispute between the ... city council and the power company so they had city lights in the street lights but they were out and ... and the town was in complete darkness as this Sunday night there was a church service\nOr a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims but I the the woman who was the head of the house\nAfter the\n... after the ... I didn't get into this in the book but I think it's true\nI don't believe that voters can murders would ... would ever have happened when they did had the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nAnd he normally would not have\nA had another outrage that quickly but because the lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up\nAnyway ... um uh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and uh the little girls spent the night with the their friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can no one is stirring around in the house\nThe um and the uh uh\nHis brother finally comes to break into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal and he is his name was ... I'm Hank Horton\nMr Horton courageously it goes through the house you have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a crazed murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here or there is a dark house\nOr he's holding matches in front of him or with no gun than to no form of protection holding matches in front of a in front of his of themself going from room to room

usually is next to the body of a little girl demand from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the little girl was usually found in a\nIn an attitude suggesting that she had been\nA she had been outraged\nThat the um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar as you can imagine what the crime was not solved a two years later a con man named Jay and walk or some came to Alaska\nAnd realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry\nHe can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry or ... and he did that by accusing I very prominent local citizen Frank Jones of financing the crimes there isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he hadn't any any connection to it\nBut this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones divided bulldoze a in a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did it or didn't do it for several years um and became\nA cable badly divided community you know families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them\nThat this battle lasted in Alaska for even though a Walker San jose eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it\nPersisted in the city I Would I Would say ... to an extent that they persist to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the ... the person he whipping up sentiment in making a false accusations of profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how um crime stories unsolved claim stories are treated yet yeah it's the same time it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working ... the crime\nThere weren't cold case police officers working the the crime still\nThe crimes have been at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing or somebody knowing somebody that\nBut it wasn't meant to almost literally like fall in their lap which again comes back to the the power of storytelling and how he just by keeping by telling a story to beginning middle and end all of these events\nIt doesn't matter how old the story is is that it it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so\nYou know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core of sensationalism\nBut it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened\nHad they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been any had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town or afterwards\n[noise] the um [noise] uh ... well there was I don't know that there was that Carver founded by it I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them\n[noise] I I'm for many years the bullets or\nAuthority that I Would say that still true today that the the chamber of commerce tribes pipes and Politico wished that but let's go was known for something else right right we are ... there is a house where the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of more tourism\nOr it's the it's a shows up on\nHer a normal TV shows and people have to take tours of the house\nThe I'm a ... if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but uh whether what let's go now and four is not mentioned anywhere\nThey um [noise] ah that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial huh yeah uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims\nVictims or mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community uh thought well and the rigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to them\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... or there's an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and transcribe the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and whatnot and joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it\nStill they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but at some of the ... still quite well remembered [noise]\nSo I Want to you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you of narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that let's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train [noise] does he have a name [noise] next coast to coast am Disney infinite [noise]\nUh you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove it\nOr ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nWell the murder of early part of family and want to\nRight well the the murder\nOf a an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had won it wouldn't even ... last for long is it wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe ... let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nYou narrowed down to a name to a person I I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example and including going through ships registries and signing whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England that happened in Central America or happened in in ... and so they were able to try to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder\nSo it just it it just it but if you have to you'll have to START I mean it's a quite a needle in a haystack but it's it's at least maybe um you know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what\nYou don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity and information about you know people are public registries that during that period\n[noise] [noise] ... you mentioned the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read\nProbably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or jak survivor was that guy or a Jack the a and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those bugs um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the um\nI never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and racial says that she did expect to find them but I didn't the um [noise] a lot when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight\nThat Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him the um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe uh uh but the number of details that match up from the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would you would a suspect was a could be coincidence\nAnd I'll I'll mentioned just a few things yeah please do that but did you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nReally matter newly will go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this was the same guy that crime must go down\nSouth for the the uh uh\nThat criminal had size six feet\nThe um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots prance that were central to the trial\nA again size six feet this is ... uh the the so we we know that this is a small man\nWell it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet not speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the or a ... and in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\n[laughter] if a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swinging acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small\nHe was five foot for the uh uh it was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you could say clearly rather it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right hand that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settled down into an area\n[noise] we had said that he must work as a longer because all the crimes\nFor about ten years occur and logging areas but first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experience the longer\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the a ... girl a that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill them out of the house first\nAnd the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThey he always used the blunt side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... backs but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts\nIn this first crime blunt side of the acts\nAnd as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the um so the crime just matches up on too many points for you to think that this isn't him\nSo that you started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile nickel Seeley I tinder in Logar axe murderer [laughter] [noise] um ... ... ... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nWedding committed the first crime he it was obviously ... who ... what do you root for his crime is obvious who had committed it 'cause he was living with the family which that's a common thing or a serial murder for crime he often kills people to home and he is directly connected and\nCan be tied so we killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who\nCan be tied so we killed the first family an Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and I was so they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a new demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using there was all Miller the weather that we use ... he wasn't even a German immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um this is speculation he could have been using a false maybe even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published\nFound the uh the the ships record in which he entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety we um are are probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nIt was like it in there and walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh\nUh uh they\nThey were so if he had been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found that ship within which became what came into the country\nIs do the sailors gate in reference to lack of nutrition for the bowl leg and there's\nNo it's a if you're on a ship it has taken a cruise sometimes on the ... ship\nRocks from side to side and when you

starting in Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing to lead stopped\nUm but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories

we had a higher and\nWell she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of stinking\nPrint evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had it in the house that the when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten in Nineteen than it was very common for people\nTo have an ax no yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah that's why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifty fifty Nineteen sixties and we had an accident what bottle outside her house and I I chopped a lot of with with them or to or burning out\nYou know my dad till the similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] I think we we did a lot of woods jumping then for some reason I did was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of demand from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating\nI'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on coal at this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guests ... feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between holds a vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically berries that acts as wise head right that's where he describes it and and when you least calm he is not going to be caught so\nYou know he he had walked the cat up into the wall and uh you know he tried to get across and under the base but instead what how how the ... but he always tried to get into what\nThey are a ... by the way while doing research on the crime book I I happen to find a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six\nA which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... among the autos is based\nThere are a poll also of course with a with a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know they uh anyway uh the answer is no ... is he absolutely was not trying to get caught in fact ... many many many cereal murders are sort of\nPlaying games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual a aversion to being caught in a while\nUsual uh aversion to being caught he didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out evasive action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on the shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene inflating the scene with or something that could be tied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed for that\nThe so no he was he was very quite unusual extent\nYeah had a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint right there I think we're a guy who didn't have any money that that uh that show some discipline um thank you mentioned let's go to Marie who's in Athens, Georgia on coast to coast for Bill James Marie\n... high ... in in um\nWell I was calling because I I was kind of curious the first of all you got out talking about the acts and\nUm my my brother and I we were in fact the game murder happened it was after the civil war in our family\nUm and he was my great however many that grandfather that was he was killed with an act and the\nFact that his wife and maybe a son did that and ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he lives right now and I feel I can hope that\nSome field workers would be blamed for but anyway and so we were investigating that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for killing a guy about two years ago by now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering and you may you mentioned earlier about\nA person you know I didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that my brother he um he seemed to be [noise] he was so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out about a person a few um\nYou know where they're from but I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean either because every little detail he sang she have now and when\nAnd where is it seems to perfect for the first time so what you're saying I I\nCertainly feel for you I'm very sorry about your brother and me too and and uh I Wish\nThere was on the ticket helped would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't I mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate\nTo uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the er but I I it's not something you can and we ... we could ritual and I were to sit out\nThe salt and other series of crimes like this we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we were doing it just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for us\nYou know I'm again I'm so sorry but the Murray let's go to my uh ... in New York uh for a Bill James on goes to goes to a um\nYeah it's got morning gentlemen and when the light to ah I see a ... year back\nIn the saddle massive well good luck with\nThat Web looking forward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment and outlets and ... over the was not to add New York it's it's over the\nInternet started out we have sex with all these cases at at hand ah people at\nThe FBI or consider that profile LA's so I\nDidn't know if you put it in a more modern contacts how a such a FBI profile of might like\nLike this guy out much for that I'm also I'd like to hear more about and whether it's in a book in time to somebody in that sense that got caught up including black people who um [noise]\nWell got by not even going that child but getting lanes and the last part is I I I you mentioned about the state at least at this time at the time that the sanctuary [noise] that's a lot of um [noise]\nI Am I recently read a book by um you\nKnow it may see as it's called how I became white dishes on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually tried to police besides the fact that you know they had like two hours looking like she would get to\nBlack folks but pay off this black then basically competing gang basically street gangs ... volunteer fire department\nDad can Keating spite thin and ... and I like in common that whether he said no you know with the gang came up as as that that form they hit ... than I listen all over the Internet thank you sound like a I don't want to thank\nYou for your most intelligent questions you know I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war because they are I wrote about them in the book popular crime\nOr they were in a there was a woman this gets back to pose there were there was a woman named Mary Rogers\nA who was murdered in um New York and I want to say in\nEighteen forty five or thereabouts a poll poll fictionalized says the murder of Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers\nA and the uh there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime but there there it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA house with his family Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they they were kind of terrorizing the city I so yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\nThe didn't hang on I'm going to put opinion you're right there because we want to get back to ...\nAnd the ... which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police lose or the other questions you have a chance to answer coming up just a minute and Dennis and Dave please hang on for Bill James taking your questions and comments about\nThe story of the men from the train to ... am this is Ian\n[noise]\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to ... to watch the movie streets in New York right to ... ... there's a lot of the ... during the ... near that's kinda cool though she left it because the question about what it is a modern police were FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI have an out and do that because\nThe that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something different that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask\nThe uh uh John Douglass monitored a wellness profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was that ah the\nUm well he had several observations about the ... crime that\nLined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older\nBecause he is extremely organized I mean is it on a chart of how organized as this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of the murders and who is a really couldn't have gone it hey because his mind is very disorganized but also because he was not physically strong enough\nUm we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say\nBecause you know they got their opinion I got mine so the book is about innocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in\nMaine and night you know to a man named Henry Lambert who was white obviously and that's that was accused of the crime [noise]\nHe was just a a he was a a a knock her out and it was I got a an uneducated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nHe was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years or before a he became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer\nEventually work work crying to free him and did for him the governor of Maine eventually a graphic added a full pardon to hear my aunt based on a ... on actual innocence\nA buddy that happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like\nThat in the in the book it's quite on it's a terrible side effect of what happened or nothing\nBut New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated not relative to now but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in places didn't have a police department\nThey are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it the ah so it's not it's not really the the uh not really that connected to my book\nNo fair enough um but it just isn't illustration it in that movie of of how those gangs type to operate within the government is the where everybody was vying for jobs even if that meant getting insights to keep them\nUm and and uh and by the way I think ... or would do indoors what you've done I think you know I don't think you'd be a very proud of the way in which they well I Hope so it's a nice of you to say not really being the I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but\nThis is the first time caller David is in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nHow am I go ahead and\nSay I'm I'm Glad to hear you back I called the call\nThank you yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments for Mr james you're a large and\nI think and you you I'm In new your homework Bill James basically invented fame or Mac or for baseball\n[noise] so I have heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know ah I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm Glad to seal the to bring it up in in law had him for that\nBut yeah I yeah I I I think he needs to be lauded for that it is an editor visor you painted visor from Boston Red Sox now but he ... his ... and I and why does China than\nAbout my thought is I think you're kind of listen to the bottom of why I I'll forgive him for that because I Love you\n... what's the broader point you think I'm missing\n[noise] I think you're ...
