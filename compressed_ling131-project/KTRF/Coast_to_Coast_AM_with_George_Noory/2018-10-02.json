with me years ago and when you were first on with me ah our executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest he's a mundane astrologer right and I went like what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for [laughter]\nIt it's it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study\nPretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology it's the astrology of nations of world leaders things like eclipse is new moons full moon of major planetary lime in other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type or readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same planet\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWill again kind of the lake or caused them rather than microcosm of people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up\nIt's this kind of where I was I read the the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties and still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports\nBaseball football and so on so I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course\nA President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there [noise] and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nMartin tell us exactly what is strongly\nAnd the world probably because of that particular event\nMartin tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell what we're said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a being called ...\nOr the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury\nAnd supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho was also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so\nMuch and I also studied all kinds of things ... regarding Atlantis or when I first\nGot into the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics lived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just\nIf we're all living on the sun or from the\nSolar perspective he Leo nothing the pilots just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day\nForward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse\nFrom our vantage point it's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station\nAnd you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours is going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you and it kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of\n... in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going into reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if you if I went to Google or safari one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde\nYear and then you click on images it's fill George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people\nAre actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you get five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same charter somebody with the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and\nOften you know people want to hear predictions you're\nGoing to go however astrology really works best in terms of ... ... as you said and he studied it I'm not just psychology and UFOs and mom dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I\nUse is called before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of is like I'll meet you at\nTen o'clock in the morning at such and such a place so that people think of time has kind of a convenient system\nIt's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon to plan if they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of the ... and the stroller ... puts it altogether\nAnd reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of solar energy lunar energy and planetary energy it's just indifferent formations\nSome setting summarizing some above some low so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most of the straw injures kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nAre use psychic too or just Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in ... which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance do welcome to planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the mundane astrology or natural things and so I'm fundamentally um I it was interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd scientifically in in sports you're astrological psychic like okay stay with us mark run a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with your stroller your website great barrier enterprises dot com Martin Lawrence [noise]\nDon't forget to watch our TV show beyond belief George Norris just log onto beyond belief dot com\nWhen the American revolution was one is is the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically and bath England\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into Taurus okay and tourists as the main\nSign of money and the ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the\nSolar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nUh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three and that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at\nThese kinds of things like a a nation's chart nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about cribs zones\nNow crypto does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that\nOver about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years the ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest fine if they've been actually looked at by\nPeople going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were chard and believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ...\nBut basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years Jupiter and Saturn and have been an earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius\nAnd then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn going to be in the air science and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more a theory\nThat are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties\nOf the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new\nAnd my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great parent prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zone so now earth Aquarius news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grapes enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well then you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend but said that he was drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died of alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything through um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charge for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology\nAlways look at the heart of a person although you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nCan put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus into science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic\nThings but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it I don't think it'll happen but well yeah well the thing is is that there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say\nThere's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal is if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated in in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly the liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that a squeaky clean well I think\nThat would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was alert you think you'll get confirmed or not\nI'm Out of your logically thinking\nEsther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell\nI I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nThem used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation you still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed that you do okay All right that that's probably why that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but I'll I'll and I'll say no ... at least you took a stand right\nBecause when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors of you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think when you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and when and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done\nAnd you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day or the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nNews when I was sure did it it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their\nFeet and then during so I don't know if it was late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this this personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un is going to be\nThe leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing is a trick\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we the other thing is uh in astrology this was very important Donald Trump's sharp President Trump's chart is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time\nCould have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening\nWe don't know the year of Kim Jong on their reports who was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five he's definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans\nAnd people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMarked tell me something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year but I mean people are uptight they're unhappy I'm Talking about general not everybody\nI'm so glad you asked me that because right after the election of the mid term on November six which is during what we called the dark in the middle and an ... interesting day says who the heck knows what's gonna happen on that\nWell please clean the

I'm doing now in in minutes or in\nA union and you'd better be minutes on this show right could you imagine the taking hours\nOkay uh you have a it's interesting\nJust like the previous caller another moon and areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius aquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller had an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three five less devising have record more than even when you have an Aquarius and Capricorn\nHum is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George you know it's something really fortuitous good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own signed a subject chariots well here's somebody Donna\nYou're born with Jupiter and ... so it's going to be home coming for you over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn so do something in the world or something you know we're making a expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or a neighborhood or\nYour state you know to do something that you feel a significant in and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctor who thing whatever it is\nAnd it's right then you'd say okay uh looks serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit well for how long you know and then come back to me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have\nTo take you know have have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is is so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there was the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook\nBut but when you have done it for forty six years you know if they're like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or among through less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into the sea the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of by Pisces what I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say is I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I could do charts\nOf compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child but my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying I'm doing it on my own if\nI can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible with well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore but I used to do a lot of marriage ... really yeah ... ...\nBut the thing is that so that's very fine tuned I'm there we have a ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something call ... so I I Would tell people to go to our strategy for thing and they couldn't\nPut in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get back current information both people\nBut basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for pilots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human ... card [noise] well I've created to erode decks one with my\nEx wife Asia uh we did in ... which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of\nPromotion of that and then I did baseball ... and I just ran into the Gulf War Philips the other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of we're doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row longer than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next the special colors burst said first of all November\nNineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Bradley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois\nIn Delano well and now how about a time any idea\nI'm I'm not sure the day time\nOkay do you have a question for mark who just want him to get going here\nYeah um I like the whole spiritual aspect to you know like a recurrent also another thing like that but I Wonder you know make a difference you know are you are and things like well I\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make it you know I Am aware of the five different elements and those kind of things in the you know the ... the the birthdays that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know is was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we're going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon war go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas that\nThat is really took that's not so unusual that yeah I mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man that's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conjunction Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on this individuals' Marjorie so he\nThe fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people who have his science Scorpio need to really get into these things\nI'm sort of in a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nDo you pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I'm I often enter you know the different lotteries powerful and so on a five years ago I had four out of the five number is a powerful didn't show up wow

why does the media ride shooting star affect anybody's astrological chart\n[laughter] um [noise]\nI don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy ya gotta Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and credible gotten it for a long time and they just had the previous issue where there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have an order to get\nWhich I think is really unique where the the people can see\n'em they can plot like\nAround America around the world when the moon would a cult a planet or star and even an asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so\nIn the software world these are amazing things but media you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one in August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAnd let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening andme aren't happy I'm coming birthday to you my friend oh well thank you hey another year oh there you\nKnow they keep clicking by do you have a question for mark or just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question which I've been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money\nLaundering money go ahead Mr learner okay a ... by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic strategy which was developed a thousand years ago\nThey were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra and there is what's called parts like the part of the of birth part of marriage and so it was something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune for Los Angeles\nAnd out on the west coast was in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon and the moon was also is the moon as an assigned cancer and is rising\nIn the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a ... and ... is\nFrom from the past from another life or other existence is in the past this person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of the need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and path okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership lever and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of lie on the head of a it'd be a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition\nIt goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually this person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about\nMysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially and initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from\nYou know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three going all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass and very and in England I mean these are kind of war but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\nNo just uh how is my upcoming year looking well Jupiter you have\nFor planets list of buddies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to tick off what are called conjunctions to house which has to do with solving problems to get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking\nAnd you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called higher on and series so those are all unusual planets ... their gifts from the heavens to Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do\nWith you know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nAnd that's not going to the Rockies November twenty of Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to forty in the morning a mark\nBoy you're going fast November twentieth Nineteen fifty five what time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to ... am let's go to Jane in Florida she was on her mind Hi Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going to help pay any questions for mark or just reading\nUm how about getting home eating\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty A L\nOkay well I'm not their mom away [laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius ... uh where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of aquarium yeah\nAnd this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven entire on is kind of a ... so this brings up the idea of getting involved with the group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint\nWhere you're kind of building rainbow\nReally good for the soul spiritual standpoint where you're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeamwork group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other\nA color you you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have an asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship\nA creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all the ... energy that the the big issue probably in your life or being a sun science Scorpio and you have sun close to Saturn is either a you need to be the warrior the esoteric he noted for Scorpio is warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every some science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next a next year next Thirteen months it starts of November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane\nUm how about a year going in to my old house of um yeah I see that yeah oh is that going to get me thinking\nWell if you don't okay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is making the square or right angle to its own position so what you want to avoid as nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology you're on that planet Iran has a lot to do with the nervous system\nSo when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects than you're using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing than good\nThings are happening but if you sort of are not on a clear path of what you're doing then if you develop a lot of anxiety and worry and stress you know you're you're going in the wrong direction you got to get back on track\nStress really does screw people more oh I

memories ah I I just used to remember how excited I was every time I read a brand new UFO story\nIn just looking at the ... flying saucers from yours a darn recollect all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good files which I I took her three through the years and I've been a long I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally got around to it and\nHopefully it's my uh it may be my swan song but I think I may maybe about this subject and\nWhy do you think the government really has not just lose what we know why don't they tell us\nWhy I think they are coming close with this latest program that with the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come\nBut um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of\nA court case but uh I think that we have known all along\nWhere these uh uh saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technology is what's the main\nIt's it sounds like a far out thing it's not something kill would approve of it in his heyday [laughter] a matter of fact the hell was reluctant to put out any of the occupation reports until I wrote the book strange effects from UFOs in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a night cap publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the um occupation cases and uh and and and things like that but of course ... main focus was to get to ... hearings he managed to do it twice in Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has the great hopes for the University of Colorado\nA UFO project in fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO pride project because we are just symptom of disarray aims of our um\nOut of some of our best cases\nAnd I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the con did report came out and kind of coup who do you lose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine now and\nFrom that time on all the funding for a night cap went out and then a\nA a there was an knockout staff member who was also had the CIA connections and\nI think the CIA had been trying to take it over a for some time of course Roscoe Helen quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after ... took over a was the first director of the CIA\nSo [laughter] yeah yeah what do you see to see how you wanted to do like just squash it\nWell I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call a didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that there was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon\nWho had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it\nUm which which struck me kind of\nI'm off balance because ah actually that was the one that\nBefore I ever came on board I think it was sixty four maybe sixty three were to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of thoroughly over a period of several hours and\nUm\nSo I think they knew all along that ah you know but they have a certain amount of control over it but uh and and kill\nA\nI don't know I I just don't know how much K O really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was willing\nTo let my cab continue um\nAs long as they can monitor\nIt as long as they could monitor right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine\nWho fired you a ... um I think it was a joke Brian he was the CIA contact the did you have like a ... a seat CIA member and the ... and and uh and Colonel Brian um\nAnd also do it for an a and a and\nA heart transplant CIA connections store next to know is the the the um ... plant in the office had CIA connections and uh I think they were just trying to see how they could eventually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nI mean wasn't my cup ... independent private organization\nIt was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho who who had the authority to let you go and kill too\nYou said that's correct he loses the founder\nYeah I Know but but the thing is that say we had a board of governors\nAnd I'm In early sixty nine they appointed a key how the president or not he was the director first they appointed and the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call at that time had left and taken a more lucrative position\nAnd or a bus and by the end of that year it took less than a year for them to a closed down me or organization but I think they had been a\nA a a\nReally monitoring us all along microwave and that's where even caught\nAirforce and one or the kill an hour on the phone and I can't hold live ... hundred miles south of Washington DC he wasn't on the office that off but that often maybe once every two months or so [noise]\nUh and we were talking about a UFO case and all of a sudden we got to click on the phone and we heard a voice has said well major Quintanilla this is Don King who is of course accurate quite mellow was the air force spokesman at the time\nAnd then we had another cat a situation where he wanted a to ask me if I were joined with him and creating got totally false case\nTo ask me if I were joined with him and creating a totally false case have happened\nTo be a ... and so we created a case where UFO had landed but there were occupancy and there were special effects ... electromagnetic ah affects aliens walking around and they actually showed up a A N one of the project boo book reports\nAnd of course back in sixty eight sixty nine I think it was we published the

program\nOh thank you George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website or do you have others\nDo we just started a great their enterprises that that's what I asked her\nTo a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the art very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA grape or enterprises my daughter has just been the Web master and Web designer looks very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what are you going up to lately well that that's what we've got a full time right well pretty much um\nAnd getting into the world of pod cast beginning things with the e books and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me are executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer right and I went what what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt it's it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIt's the astrology of nations of world leaders thing with like a clip says new moon is full moon major planetary alignment in other words it's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long [noise] um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type for readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same planet\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWill again kind of it's the maker causing rather than microcosm so\nPeople who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and\nWhen I was growing up it's just kind of where I was they read the the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually\nMostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports\nBaseball football and so on so I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course\nA President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMore on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is drawing the G is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to\nAncient Egypt the idea of a a a being called ... or the the thrice great harmonies which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of\nNumbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so\nMuch and I also studied\nAll kinds of things ... regarding it laughter is uh when I first\nGot in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics lived at the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing\nThe pilots just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away\nAnd the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the plot of now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point it's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay\nNow another train right next to yours is going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you ended up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of\n... in your in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion so what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now in two thousand eighty and if you if I only went to Google as far as one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde\nYear and then you click on images it's fill George with all kinds of things like stop signs and wrote sign saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people\nAre actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you get five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and\nOften you know people want to hear a prediction we're gonna go\nHowever astrology really works best in terms of ... ... as you said and he studied it I'm not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else\nBut he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of as like I'll meet you at\nTen o'clock in the morning at such and such a place so that people think of time has kind of a convenient system\nIt's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of the ... and the ... puts it altogether\nAnd reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but ... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and planetary energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above some low so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most ... kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just these droplets I'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my\nMy son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that science rather reticent to to be a for instance do well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff much more focused that's why the Monday and astrology on our church will things and so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you asked me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't broadcast it but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd scientifically in in sports you're astrological psychic like okay stay with us mark run a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer ... great beer enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nDon't forget to watch a TV show beyond belief with George Norris just log onto beyond belief dot com\nWhen the American revolution was one is is the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically in bath England\nUm but at the rate that planet has just gone into tourists okay and tourists as the main sign of money and the ...\nNew York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years and the sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSoda things coming out of left field shock some surprises your audience will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back uh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy\nSix he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three and that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kind of thing with like a nation to chart\nA nations are born like people if you can locate the birth of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about Chris zones\nNow crypto does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just\nAstrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ...\nBut basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years Jupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn going to be an air science and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that's\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's cold astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great parent prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zone so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this uh we'll see you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call um a friend but said that he was drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died from alcoholism you know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything through um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology\nAlways looked at the heart of a person although you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nCan put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological he's speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality\nVenus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it I don't think it'll happen but well yeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I open hazard a guess you know I Would just say\nThere's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative as somebody else who's going to be nominated in ... in his place so it's not as if suddenly it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean well I think\nThat would be because they've been saying that uh uh\nWell I bought my question was delivered you think you'll get\nConfirmed it on um logically thinking\nEsther logically we know his chart I Would\nLogically thinking\nWell astrological we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nYou hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed\nThat you do okay All right that that that's probably why that\nMight be one I I I I'll be wrong on but I'll\nI'll and I'll say now at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next up let's talk about Kim Jong on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\n[noise] I think it's a done deal that they're going to have nuclear weapons they win and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done\nAnd you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nNew sure did it it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what\nYou know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this this personal diplomacy we don't know of Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing is a trend\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we the other thing is uh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's char President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time\nCould have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening\nWe don't know the year of Kim Jong on their reports he was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five he's definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans\nAnd people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMarked telling me something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year but I mean people are uptight they're unhappy about talking about general not everybody\nI'm so glad you asked me that because right after the election of the midterm on November six which has during what we called the dark the ... interesting day says who the heck knows what's gonna happen on that day with the votes the next day we have a new moon in the ... the intense sign of Scorpio there'll be November seventh and guess what on the day after that the largest", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "02"}
