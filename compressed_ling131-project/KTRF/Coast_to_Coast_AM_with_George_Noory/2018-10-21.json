in depth radio news talk contests [noise] last night I mentioned this news talk ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction it's more like Ninety to Ninety years [noise] also last\nOr should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife [noise]\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time and alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist Harry Houdini\nHoudini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of cycling ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books\nExposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his blood\nAfter death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he will do sell than more than two years after his death his wife best attended the sands\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channel the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry and bass initially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the playoffs despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say also in October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any mad\nThomas ... is a writer and passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest more than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled Houdini afterlife experiment did it work\nIn it he argues it's quite possible Houdini did communicate from the grave during a say on held in January of Nineteen twenty nine\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did\nBreak off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise]\nWhat do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing [noise] um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of out or in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this that play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow now part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own sort of photo psychic\nAct or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of\nPenn words and the tenth word is actually a phrase and each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero\nAnd so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry in best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reach in their pocket political line what is the last two digits on the coastline\nAnd they these were which\nMm pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number\nAnd so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight and so it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins that mess held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to invariably using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight to eight eight were in in the ... so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just numbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please speak quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered took baths and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people are saying it's unpaid da da da da da\nDa da da da da and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and for all of twenty five cents\nThey would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there they'll show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten were and how it used\nTo form numbers but not out of form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and um it see I hear some bullet points about it that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that the secret message within code word to leave and the actual\nSecret can word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini\nSo in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud\nWithout looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because\nNow we get into the say on and and uh we should back up and explain that aren't Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best [noise]\nWell outputs are not interested in it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these\nSessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise] one of his clients is getting and reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session\nAnd in his on putting the words forgive\nAnd all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother\nTo show him that his mother's soul was spirit we're surviving death and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't want to say I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking is going to the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThomas resentful my gas the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there the the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there Ford shows up and he Arthur Ford usually works with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and\nSo sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show a very theatrical show where Harry would work with best the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with theory very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they coated them and after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that best as a nickname\nThat Harry used for her was Roosevelt\nAnd this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married\nAnd this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring and so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Rosa bell believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise] so I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet because I'm trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have\nKnown that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other\n... and and again he just he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher does just that showed the word believe they used the secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look and be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on said oh this is a lot of\nNonsense that wasn't true and and so best that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only her three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start to do now denounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or graphic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't\nWant her name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him and she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but there is hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says ah I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBeth heard about at well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a ladder um to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a\nLiar I mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on\nI had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg\nIn an article posted on the website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this\nYou know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this fester and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just folded\nAnd said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if anyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's fall by will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward a ten thousand dollar prize to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really was in cahoots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty\nPretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean\nBut it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money [noise]\n[noise] right so your your feelings are the bass basically and she herself was in a vow to a bunker for fifty years and uh and so the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted\nYeah that's what happened um I think the subtitle of my as they said something like that does Mrs Houdini want to be a NATO or something like that it's not on the online version but um but anyway I think she just got tired\nDog can you help more than a million veterans every year they face and constantly there challenges my victory is being able to be there for my family with American veterans when we all win support more victories for veterans go de da de dock\nDe ... charged migrants press on remember coots at two suspects had been charged in connection with the fatal shooting of ...

you know when somebody I'm Don ... instant pop relatives because we're all we can leave her head and they fight their way back\nUsing sure will um installing ... bars or over the bed so they can use or ... and then dragging your body you're trying to themselves or walk every day and the ... when that happened to them you know the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came in and actually work he started to identify with people were suffering in who are needy you lose the encampments exploiting humble pie it actually changes life\n[laughter] right I mean he he displayed ... you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had our actions and brands but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had the bars and stalled out in front of liberals mansion\nAnd he would have some of these races and he would use crutches and the ... and it's just incredible and take off but it it you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg\nAnd he was dragging and solve it is due to the parallel bars where he's exercising bombs and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd then he's turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops and we're going to leave it talked about iron clad will\nMean that that was was uh was really something else I'm going\nTo want to come back that that part and then of\nCourse he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia with the warm waters with cheapest wage in my children and other people with other selections and ... billion package his wife to identify with people in need and suffering so it really changes what for sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a set of a sudden the sketch of of his\nJourney to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nIs truck for the White House ... ... or ... Wilson and he turtle huddle house actually who Woodrow Wilson was like all colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's won't be like they didn't know what if they find that he was a it was it was a hostile and playing\nAnd um they were ... they fall in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it really that but it was just like a great thing and\nIt was through at um from my house and I'm\nI'm a geologist and actually looking assistant secretary of the navy and from their intended to use the rules\nWell look in system secretary in the navy and from there it can seem to use those ... million and that the political connections of New York to vote for governor and then once governor I'm In ... was a it was a jump to the White House one\nAnd he asked them to come out of the time well uh\nIn in ... some of the things that I Want it to\n'em over want it to do but\nYou know he would get back to cooperate very well what what are some of those were his ideas\nAnd now we don't have to jump right to a huge on correct with the White House and you know started the original he ran on tax cuts and everything and we realized that the oldest working you ... and what you know with a socialist\nEnd of it and uh you know was amazingly well farm and you become friends with the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal and the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or that had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind and how\nWould that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels equal to walk it's a very simple but maybe you don't just like well a [laughter] like today without whether I Know they go up preaching\nShort [laughter] yeah yeah absolutely terrible suffering you he gets a free pass to\nBe a between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back on it which all history repeating repeating so will the Russians\nAnd the White House and\nYou know just all kinds of things it's incredible are popping in your town and won't won't catch it but you know they felt the hell\nBut how is it sets a that no one sort of ... you don't notice store or said hey wait a minute or president does in a in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then obviously we know better now\nBut the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago uh that no one would take notice of that well\nThey they they pick their camera shots well and I hope people sort of the opposite that this was a guy would be what you really think on four or five thought processes that one you really really really shocked\nWhen he would do is we need to be like without some one on one arm he will lift their arm and he would help but look watcher or something\nIt would appear to be walking it could take a couple of steps so it could I guess you know behind the podium use are different and the shops and you know they they did it remarkably well\nSo it it or to ward off the fact\nThat a case anything get eight page search something to go public and claimed that you know I was experienced it so that was showing any for X amount about\nSo I mean propaganda and all those oils Walsh anything back down you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control I just like oh we didn't have other things that you know cell phones and cameras on the phone so you know why they do it at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll just the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which are seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely the um\n... like this is complicated I I'm distraught the toy eleven had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January\nSo we didn't go go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rules or at a waiter take off for or ex so this mystery\nThing on the hundred days and they still judge presidents by ... hundred days [noise] um actually I had one hundred is does the pitching\nRight he had a fourth he had a four months to a head start listening will not take a timeout will come back Steve and talk

FDR is ... is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd are you certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banks system has failed and it's just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad or you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring accounting me going and of course and you're even remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things\nWere starting to we're started serving to\nBe able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise a few taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR in ... there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this has low vision of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people and or so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of health for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the gun route paycheck and um this was the ... experiment\nFrom the communist communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay\nSo all of this information or was coming through\nHis friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on the study or and so this was their idea of how\nTo help the workers and the working class and it was a flood of legislation\nOr were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking food to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have the cradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had\nFooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the or the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism said that because\nI'm Sorry about that I hear the noise the pitfalls and valleys in of of uh of capitalism you know so\nRight you meant you if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative uh\nUm actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy act to beer wind revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief act agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage activity valley authority acts securities act aggregation of gold payment class homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I was\nI'm happy to board them with your show [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had to kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it\nCertainly was the same basic intro he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either to disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nWill write what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worry you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so\nWell all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he is the single that's Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so [noise]\nUm they start to put in a you know implement the second new deal\nAnd they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so we um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and that was I mean he was really really fiddling with ... I mean a tremendous amount\nAnd I know in the history books history\nA lot of things uh I Know the history books paid who is this wonderful magical genie of economic success he wasn't it was an economic failure people were uh they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move them\nAnd you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we\nWere ... you know we're we're we're still gonna be the new deal for ... death I mean that was it was a it was a cat us it was a cutoff because atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's misplaced you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\n[noise] well [laughter] again when he did was he was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the St Louis the same thing with the with the one lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to defeat the axis powers and he was giving them to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union so that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time\nSo there's there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal is not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country\nAnd there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your have your water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for instance the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brand so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many hats that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or what he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think after the hours probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just love war\nHe did everything to make World War two happened and I might catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right um the Japanese were their oil debtor nation meaning they don't create enough oil to run what they have to do in their country so they're getting our oil from us\nThey were coming off a huge war with China made in the last thing they wanted was to go to war against us so they were trying to negotiate and negotiate and negotiate and what happened was we shut up the oil spigots on which forced them to go island hopping we'd already broken the Japanese communication\nJokes grew to take a moment to make money\nWhich is ... is going to fatherhood dot Gov

these last well nearly five years so God Bless Godspeed and good luck to Nathan state then I Hope we can work again some time just wanted to remind\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nBecause deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents were declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders on call me crazy so he can really go back and pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA there's a large aspiring American history thirty three members and that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on\nUm operation Pistorius' or was another notch he's firing eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor or they attacked Chilean targets and has a state and they were all caught and I believe\nEach one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones\nDid they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt\nRoosevelt's I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about\nThe parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years Seventy five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communists completely frustrated at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo he'll give me an example of give me an example in in Roosevelt White House of some of the the communist and they had a ... year\nOh well the first communist\nOverhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were there\nWere hundreds of them at least Fifteen higher ranking officials in the White House were knowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder his\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins was turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about Harry Hopkins is a lengthy later so they don't get bored and go away it's more common [laughter] um\nThe or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOf the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I I won't bore you one with a laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's closest\nFriends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously every FBI couldn't travel very well\nBecause of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk to Stalin and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the CPU essay the Communist Party the United states of America which is still in existence by the way I don't know if I mentioned that or not\nAnd how Hopkins in down and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by\nWas also Arkansas I could live my lease program to help the Soviets out So Harry Hopkins ... famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America for all of this happen okay I'll get to that in a minute or ...\nThere's an America will be for all of this happen okay I'll get to that in the middle of\nA he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a cage he'd be the factor and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB the factors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contracting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know is a nuclear weapon they so here we have I mean there are informants inspires all around the FDR\nSo so the point where they he goes to the trunk conference\nYou know I mean that'd be a style knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of a an artist's weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill\nHim styling right information right he had plans in the post war world of\nTaking America was have communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this is a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this\nAnd that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations to\n'em or directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors ended with a target and they would were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work\nAnd they went to a city in the city's names escaping it ... it is listed in my book in the ... they were to observe how\nRussia did things and how everyone was care for how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this year countrymen because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway\nYou have loudly so it was a fictitious pound that didn't exist it was made it hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by style and spelling is the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish in his\nWife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the most of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and he was nothing more than\nA he used to keep the party's journals and used to call them comrade um with with their own Conrad index card he was Tacoma a blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party one by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control\nI mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from lenders will become rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMerge I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve we'll take a timeout Wilson ticket taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who

late so I'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much of the post\nWar world is a result and then then the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition he greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your\nPain forty four when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt Scrabble condition or and and um FDR really didn't know what happened do you just was so out of it but\nI mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference and obviously he is he he looks like death warmed over seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean what is going on with what happened to know seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them [noise] um every hour as being slowly\nPoisoning from within the White House and\nI have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of toys and let's see we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was plentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet\nBut the rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older\nSo in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially 'cause they didn't know what was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger\nEvery time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or\nSo you know I I did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in the tiny Marcia Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient so this is what people asked me we just start looking into this for and this and that\nI also thought it was convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period I said you know wait a minute I really got to look into this I didn't believe that in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history\nYou know I mean [laughter] it but in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and his his cardiologist Dr Howard brew in they were they had\nNo idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless well\nAnd this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing and\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre\nWho's the White House physician who was also the vice admiral and in\nA certain sort of in general the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors or he was chief of cardiology with as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy\nNo idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled\nAs because FDR is getting sick after\nMeal times this is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would go normal and then it would go it would go warring\nOut of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nTo every and it wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they got to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day\nDr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he was a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines after the march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this was a dead man walking\nAnd the what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR as being slowly poison styling style and got him I can tell you that I'm\nStyling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share the world we're I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share of the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world he\nWas a megalomaniac with what he didn't Soviet Union\nOf course we didn't know that the one that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWas a big died that was part of the negotiation team in the u._s.\nWho wants it they died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S at ... ... ... on the way back from the altar or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain ...\nWell there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about those are his name was pile Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way like I Believe in that surround conference dies on this ship\nOf a cerebral hemorrhage he gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary\nAlso named Mac and starting to relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of his cerebral hemorrhage the drug of the day is offering\nRat poison in its\nPower was tasteless or the U.S and its circulating all over the place is a matter of fact styling got murdered or the rat poison or for them and from the internal that his government\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay\nStyle wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was\nUm a tremendous mine and he couldn't outsmart them\nOkay so here's you know this had to happen um for style and to get his way and we he had been so infiltrated the government with it everywhere\nEverywhere as a matter of fact to thicken the plot FDR dies in front of two Russian Spies or he was having his portrait painted in Elizabeth assume it's off\nUm she was a Russian she was

command at Langley air force base in Virginia and during the Nineteen sixties\nI was killed earlier this week after being hit by a trailer while cycling in Lansing New York at wolf had written to fame back in two thousand and one after claiming to have seen photographic evidence of extraterrestrial structures on the far side of the moon\nDuring his time in the air force he had worked as a photographic surveillance technician\nWhich is mostly involves working with the machines that process video footage recorded in Vietnam\nAnd this particular occasion however he had been asked to report to the an essay facility on the base to help with the processing of some images taken during a recent lunar mission while he was there another airman showed him a photographic mosaic comprised of images taken\nDuring multiple passes of the lunar orbiter\nUm I think it was his ballet and he would do would you would get give is a lay out a picture of cream and some cruel or oatmeal or something and then there's ... it's been described as his glass of green liquid\nOr how they get it in that in a glass of Greenland Clinton was it the doctor when they connected to salary\nI I you know I'd love to say I know everything about this I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt had was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with us\nUm and she commissioned a private investigator to uh to the bottom of this stuff so I Do know that um the private investigator hit a dead end all of FDR's medical records were were stolen from all walks violent with us though\nSo one of four people had those keys one of them was a doctor and a ... it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote a the uh the books being um the White House physician\nAnd that was a Ross and Ross McIntyre were they in on the murder habits only new idea I I I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit\nLittle ignorant maybe and and what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she which has been\n[noise] well they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well\nThey packed up the uh I'm a Robin and shuts off and they\nThrew loose Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get out of Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book um her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the place that they took\nTo to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm you know why I don't know why\nWould you lie fleet a scene right right\nYou know I mean if it's a natural death why still records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually um JFK shot in Dallas\nThey break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas\nThey break law to bring him to besides the now the law was\nThe same in Nineteen sixty three is it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same\nNo the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the ... with us so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed a legally\nThey're both at the fed as though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know this because we could talk you know and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him in the open being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo nor did by the way and no one bomber\nNo autopsy knowing bombing it's just easier\nAnd crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there\nAre other presidents in history who I also believe that a murder that they've lost over\nUm Warren Harding Warren Harding\nWas it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but\nAs far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter]\nThe information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book has been published for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book I mean there's two out\nTo be a volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here ah and he's in Alabama and the wild card line any good morning welcome to coast\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about some ... ... well several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party she said to my aunt who work at the state department and managed remind now\nI'd also like ... that's an experience with the blood dancer scrap from my grandmother which was water for in a college true to handle things all over it looked like British cars it constantly bleeding all in the body Montana\nAnd it came time to name from\nThere you go like you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right if she's right I mean it thins the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or\nThey'll have an ... or something or a cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course I Know Dr but no my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of blood and her so\nRight my late father was as well\nSure not necessarily caused brooding with any thanks for calling in\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nMy hide their good morning okay\nAnd quick odd sleepover to and I listen all over the ad finally I\nThought I heard 'em out it it can't all men on the air I heard read at top play pool also believe that the our waste waste a lot of it and I'd like to know if he hadn't have in the area around it\nI can ... and when it hit the grasses so he would be someone that we talk about that new the new deal [noise] as a [noise]\nI wouldn't have I think around that that off for that show called Great Depression and so I like it so I feel like that and last late ... about\nBoth a direction connection and the job both FDR and they shot a towering stable genius if you will and the White House in pain somewhat different because\nI went to shake and they have to have more to do with leading up even how he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to an ... a lot like a lab but right on ... and and of course he\nI don't see a fifty fifty sat you know we know that he has a trivia teas and in\nMy I had if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think you're being kind of facetious\nOr about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to FDR where we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dos and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR and no Webster a little bit and and I've had dinner with him and and you waxes on about the new deal\nUh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I Am to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nAs far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of being a little facetious as to how how everyone is in how history you kind of repeats itself\nBut kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter] we\nWere right back in the same thing we have another red scare in in the country and it's really it's really something else to fully Joseph Joseph ... you know he would he would really enjoy this I think\nRight so I think the point they were making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with Trump which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow how the two of the history is another red scare it's starting to repeat itself all over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats\nItself becomes relevant actually I'm an interesting book I think you'll like it thanks for ... for going in\nWe will uh we're heading into a break here at the at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we can\nAnd here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking us into the break on coast to coast am [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBack in a bar I don't I've read up on this path with tall and how it got away with all that stuff but Roosevelt God dollar that somebody to look at Roosevelt body currently and make sure that uh let's see if he would he would call 'cause uh uh I'm calling it a lot of that\nAnd I think it was the er the story was that it was ... to ... he won that Roosevelt Web ... Rick I'm over the cold that the that to Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of but truly I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I think he did not want him that he wanted to live longer they pop like\nThat's just my my take on it All right interesting Jon Cote bad shape you're going to die anyway All right Steven you want to reply\n[noise] um I you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em have shown slanted okay\nI'm not suggesting that what you said has been he looks so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison\nThat's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four\nThis wasn't from the advance on polio and it spills without very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history is an awful lot of people who researched this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure but um as far as style in style in one of the rule the world\nHe didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he sent something to look in the ... in the in the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on\nHe was already being for the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he\nDied so if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that it didn't if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you for that to me to sing points there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning look at the coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr ... he's just show banning it in your research was ... ah did you come across all anything about the ... to ... an attempted coup against so Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nUh if it happened if you came across it how close was it a ... happening and if it costs us ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler and that\nOne of the people involved was ah I think was a guard or did you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it comes to happening\nUm if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nSomething that you discuss in the book but or is it Steve\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really\nI don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who didn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capital is to holding office as long as he did it would not would not surprise me but I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so\nThanks for calling I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I should I felt that I knew everything\nAll right James thank you for that Wayne is in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to cost\nYou rich or once on who you cannot do your job do you feel good return from from nine to ...\nWell that's very kind of you to say but it's you know it's going to guess like Steve who who make my job very easy\nRight where are our you're ... you're the Mars commercial back in the day to Mars period at commercial where we're to talk about um your career move ... colored you're married than regular commercial certain students triggering a bar in her\n... year I was almost getting hungry Wayne and tell you had to bring up church you know [laughter] I Know I Know\n... or were they were [laughter] order um\nWe are ... you're on your go another ... ... no not really what I'm\nTalking about ... you're talking about\nAnd making a very ... probably ... ... ... everybody are committed suicide or nurse weren't Eleanor hurry up and bury him so nobody knew about it I I've been looking for the man on a on the line on ... where are the sort of ... knock your farm where\nHe gave a very compelling period it would be very ... very man on and do your own writing now ... you know where do you think we're\nSure I'm I'm not a I've not heard that before but I'd have to I'd have to look into that um [noise]\nI guess the question would be why why would he um why would he do that I don't even have you have you ever come across anything indicating that any theory that if that FDR may have tried to take his own life or did they can only\nKnow that's a new one on me uh I haven't heard that but again like I said I'm I'm you know I I Know what I Know I don't know what somebody else knows [laughter] I just I just I wrote this book and I ... I followed the line\n[laughter] I just I just I wrote this book and I ... I followed the line of facts that brought me to it and I found information along the line who cooperative you know if somebody else has come up with that I don't I don't maybe as quality of life couldn't have been great\nYou know with the with the situation in the head with this polio I mean anything's possible people said that all of us probably committed suicide to um I certainly I certainly uncovered in who murdered oversight certainly uncovered information that the bone to that but\nI guess anything's possible I mean if there is a situation where I can get on the air with the other fellow you know what I mean I Would respectfully love to do so\nI'd like to look into that a wing thank you for that can you hear Neal wall welders in Pennsylvania we're moving fast You're welcome morning welcome to coast to coast\nPart Richard nice to talk to your once again likewise thank you\nWhy should I don't want to join a mistrial Benny ... motives yours character or anything but uh we have to remember that in Nineteen forty four I went up to our passed away the light expectancy for men I Believe was only like forty nine that sixty so\nThat sixty three FDR was already beating the odds soda ... big now\nAn additional medical science she was pregnant or ... or we can go back bring the the L let's when Elvis died in Nineteen Seventy seven or the medical science compared to the ... was permitted now as I recall Mr obeying the uh\nI Believe I called the last time Mr oh Benny when John and he said that Elvis had no history of heart disease now\nUh with all due respect Richard his mother was born in my case since ... died in Nineteen fifty eight which would make her at the most forty two and she died and his father died relatively young I Believe ... Shetland so here we have to ask ourselves whether\nOr not it was in the genetic cards for outlets to level I'm Alive\nOr else he can tell you that he's and then he talked to the person who held Elvis had heart in his hands and said that there was no loss the do you tell there was no evidence of a heart disease at least none that had would be sufficient to kill him I mean it may have developed later but it wasn't present at the time of his death\nRight Hi well thanks again for your call I'm Gladys died because\nColonel Parker she was ... was ... okay colonel Parker toll Gladys that you're obese and I can't film you with Elvis and I wanted to take pictures with you with Elvis because people want to see all of us his mother because there was a rumor out that Elvis had shot his mother\nWhich was ridiculous so he said I Want you to take his diet pills I Want to get your skinny so they can put you in pictures with Elvis\nI'm the diet pills and the alcoholism\nCombined is what killed her okay that's what happened with that as far as all of us was concerned in his heart um there was no real evidence of a heart attack I'm In a I talked to Dan war like who was actually on the autopsy and they took Elvis Presley is hard\nAnd they caught it they thinly sliced it every quarter inch\nTo look through everything and they held every quarter inch part up to the light and they looked at it under the electron microscope\nThere was no real evidence of a heart attack there was no ... there was no hemorrhaging there was no nothing Elvis frozen his heart was a little oversized whatsoever so we're all of his other organs\nHe was years away from heart disease and you can clearly be said that um there was there was no uh Elvis Presley did not die from any sort of a a cardiac event now the coroner who said that he died from a a cardiac arrhythmia\nWas telling stories and mother goose here we have the autopsies not even finished these tests aren't even in yet he's telling the world that Elvis Presley died of a cardiac arrhythmia\nIn order for him to determine that he would have had to listen to the beating heart permanent anchor rhythm you can't be determined when Howard has stopped\nYou can't find a a a wacky heartbeat and wants to hurt speeding\nSo that was the story that was put out there um", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "21"}
