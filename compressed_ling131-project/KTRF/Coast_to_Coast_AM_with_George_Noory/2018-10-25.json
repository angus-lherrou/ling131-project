... you know how did this all started for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and and she's also happens to be of I I consider to be a very powerful which and\nAnd he wanted me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um and like I I feel like whatever she does with the on it's just so amazing that instead of doing that work for me\nShe empowered me and taught me how to do with my health [laughter] so I guess you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest of history\nI feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spouse that I've\nVery very confident with with what I Do you know with the spells it I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more\nAbout healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killing\nHave you ever ... belong somebody never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what\n... what what good are shows that if you didn't win any\nYou know I think that\nThe power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in\nMy mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we\nStart healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up a money spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the\nUm healing and crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we\nAbsolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply chanting uh spell and when I work my rituals\nI chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say ... that long I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing for\nJimmy in ten seconds just or get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kind of

George\nWhat are you nervous for talking of billions of people right above\nExcited though I'm Still when I exercise my house because I Do do a house ...\nEvery single month to keep out the entities in any you know opportunists that happened to be sure crossing by and I will say on\nNegative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I cast you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the ceiling and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chance spelled like when I Do want crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often\nAnd I know real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy and we are we I mean we have given our power away\nTo not only our friends and family but to the government and it you know we were just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we\nWe feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why

that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell you the courage to ... to demons Savage I have I had um you fight them off or do you do with it\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story to Maya demons later [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive Damon and men this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's a ... or send us in the ... is a religion and um they need to be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset\nOr some sort of you yes on ... it's a religion or ...\nAnd so they work with magic and they work with the ... which are different spirits [noise] um so this\nSon that'll had sent a

blame it on a train as soon as they turned off my light\n[noise] um I was ... down to my bed [noise] and I was terrified I I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was just like\nI couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I had something

situation and you should have wasn't going well what was happening\nAt that point I was pinned down on my bed and then all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell\nOn my ear going up and down I don't know if there's a pall over a half foot but it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was pinned down so this wave of courage\nJust came over me and I just thought you know I I I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I I made that adjustment in my mind right I I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just\nPeeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just warmed\nUp [laughter] like when I went up and I'm\nNot kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone but it just like it flew away obviously that's right ...\nIt is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't have believed me but I did go back to that psychic woman that look like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say it never happened again after that time so I Know that this man is something that came in and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the laid off for about three months after that\nFit totally terrified me it was\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that\nWell you know I'm not going to list did they say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nOr drunk or shine yeah\nWe're we're going to the ... or the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a tackle which uh which should have a check your email\nOr which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nKind of one of the ...\n[laughter] I Can't do it even if I tried and so one of the reasons\nThat I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand I'm considering we've all lived thousands of lifetimes on and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them\nUm some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof for my ... who kind of confirmed um nice you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma\nSo they can be you know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime I'm\n... the demon that is\nIs usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the demon die unless you like slate you\nCast them all but the they don't wanna guard\nExactly there's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at George it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reincarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest him now that's\nOne one theory and I can say I'm with confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days has a lot of cases of\nOf people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey into their past lives and nail it\nAnd nine times out of ten these people have made hacks with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks\nI mean and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free and um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think\nMost people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... what what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will\nCast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it and what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so\nThis is why it is extremely important especially right now um to to really really really really\nClear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and he'll our our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases of the demon intrusions and people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely\nUm manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California to get started I

guest behind the secret door I guess two it was one for one so far we get to your calls as well stance with us for about twenty ... more minutes or so\nStand you wrote a book with Kathleen Martin was the niece of Benny Hill called captured which is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause when look magazine came out with the interrupted journey or the story of Barney and Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age how would you categorized that case the Barney and video case\nI think it's a very important case and for several different reasons I'm\nOn the people are not talking about people who don't have a reputation we're not talking about people who are trying to seek ... for attention and say that he was a social worker or respected member of the community\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney ... she was white that was very unusual in the early sixties it took guts for them to\nCome out and that's right and\nThey were very concerned about what the reaction would be a while this was in the early sixties and you know you got to ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard of what's going on you got to have people who can handle eats speak\nIt's unfortunately the army didn't live terribly long time in Nineteen sixty eight I guess and I'm\nA buddy I'm Around a long time for which I Am glad and uh it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with early [noise]\nNot sensational live I mean let's face it stand back and say betting Barney where specimens for somebody\nAnd they weren't ... treated but they certainly weren't going on for glory and claiming all kinds of must see things as being part of their interaction with the aliens and\nYou know I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on\n... and I I was very impressed and I was impressed by something else uh the medium\nIn that case a K in Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh you know I I that's where I made my view on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty and Barney into town\nAnd told me where they were staying and which is very unusual\nYou know an eye contact with them we had dinner together or just the three of us\nAnd I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I hadn't dealt with stuff like this I mean it is a little bit crazy story aliens grabbing a couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you\nWell yeah I mean you'd have you done a pretty early on was early yeah\nAnd the sixties and it's no longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties\n[laughter] that's right no till I was very fortunate\nTo have met them one on one so to speak and I saw it in the ... conferences I didn't get too many meetings with Barney 'cause he died within two years when I first met him a lesson that\nA very who's gone on and of course I worked very closely with that he's nice Kathleen Martin we've done three books together and ah\nThat's been a pleasure to a if not often you find it can break with people uh have co written ... books ... with other people but uh we seem to be compatible\nYeah you you you too clicked and she's great in in the field and you follow due to\nA ... super person you don't jam\nBut when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed him over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in a you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I said so what do you think Dr a ball they're\nTelling you the truth or not what do you think he said I I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe they're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them ... under hypnosis separately told the same story\nAnd they they believe whatever they saw happened to them and he said based on that\nI cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying\nWhat happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\n... ... we have to remember that the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran\nYes called the ...\nBefore anybody would get the balls and stuff like that\nYeah and he had learned to use a ... means of bringing guys who had terrible experiences you know your buddy said on off next year battle [noise]\nAh that's traumatic but weeks and so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up in his hands and you know I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business\nBut he sure we thought that these people are not in line that's right there was\nNot looking for attention at the center of senator I was impressed with ... and uh\nI was a personal but even born into Barney ideal ... forties and uh unfortunately but they they they were they had nothing to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early ...\nWas not parading itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak to resist the reporter with the story out much that they're surprised some relief retreated fine\nAnd they found out around the world and that's the thing that I have a little look I lecture to Nineteen countries\nI'm skimming me pretty good handle on one of the people and think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know ... ... visitors from some place else\nAnd I found I just haven't had bad reactions\nYou know and if anything it's getting even stronger I think let's take some calls for instance let's go to a drawn in Virginia Beach east of the Rockies go ahead John you're on which dancing Friedman\nStan and get a job as a state in the the um you know a weird in past couple of years of several years really we've been sending radio signals Dallas space and um\nAnd we said that we put out any time that you are and with all the photos that ... it will be poured it seems to me that the one on what it picked up that ... and ... some kind of reflects\nWhat are the ... either one of you know anything\nWhen we were we picked up the wild signal stand firm said the search for extraterrestrial intelligence they really don't know what it is it could be a star burst
