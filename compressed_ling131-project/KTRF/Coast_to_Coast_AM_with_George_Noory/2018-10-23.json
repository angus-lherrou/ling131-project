... the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so ah we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions and space astronomy missions uh\nTheir work in that field is epic bought a human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that and um so I think it's it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy that privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like fading away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all\nUm the uh you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic space flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program I mean that storm to have it in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter] what what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember to die off so they can tell people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who doubt that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission\nI mean let let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter] the the the ...\nAt the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\n[noise] the the the ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal\nI Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill and I'd pass on that at the end this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you'd probably sell me what you buy the swarm play and you'd probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp plant then with this news well\nYou know would be ... doing what he's doing falcon next base sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's just a poignant Robert it really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nUh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class\nIn terms of its ability to execute great projects on an act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan a chaos and the the the you know so\nThere it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while would come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us\nUh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping ... Stein would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching then half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nUh the they didn't know what it was they thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because shore we started the space age with expendable\nRockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a\nKilogram traumatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was\nDone on a shoestring compare to 'em what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like from one tenth the money in one third of the time\nThat any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless\nUh so okay Bezos has his own money he's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies a firefly a vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the\nUs space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just\nNever going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and but people than say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the problem [noise] and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well\nMaybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours lacks the coast to coast\nThey I'm always on your phone and you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nAh driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for\nDoing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish he he um and he certainly\nUm I'm\nNot above using people uh [noise] and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um\nThat that's the other side of it so you know a ... that you know there is [noise]\nUm\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches you go about that\nIt's not exactly ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the only had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know uh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core\nTo to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone so you know that's must to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motives of the hero okay so I I think\nMust be a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out a ... looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know\nUm how would you come from the just results Robert\nWell Jeff Bezos is much calmer a much more laid back\nUm I don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and\nIf you look at how the two companies are run\nA they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um the company takes chances\nAnd thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay\nSo I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base just doing it all with his own money\nOkay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world a and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stocky cheer sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin so\nHe he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has some limited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less uh because\nUh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still and whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground and um the ground penetrating radar\nOn the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now\nUm that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth some of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and be there still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter\nHas found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust\nKnows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north and the northern hemisphere of Mars which by the way the same latitude a San Francisco so imagine that there were glaciers\nIn San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know\nI'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get at it with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think so there's there's ... there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not\nOkay contamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France she won't know if the people there are French or not I mean ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and they will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that dinosaur bones don't prove that they were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and\nAnd and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it it's all been a trick by\nTricky gods and and um I mean it's just absurd um so if you believe that\nJust visit greener gadget dot or\nYour

thing to to um oh human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just to run them down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one of the Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity\nUm which goes along with your last question of a spinning space craft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spend the spacecraft crates and trickle force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage\nIn order to ah prevent\nThe deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with 'em in zero gravity\nLong range belongs to a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and ... you know and moving around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that and so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo not at all and won't be able to do anything for it\nAnd then the the the third question was electric repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount of electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate at ... pounds to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with a chemical roster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electric propulsion systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car and you know in San Francisco and um you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world 'cause your car can drive\nUh the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because of your car and drive over water in this case\nBut in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electrical pulse and then it does with chemical caution\nIf because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there on the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would um be cautious [noise] you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and Marshall's got much more resources so mean to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to Greenland you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene lung before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I say is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with the go to the moon don't come off with\nSome other thing that the halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nHow can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber wears the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead law but\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these probes are what you are\nOr what would you be dealing with extreme heat even open space\nAs opposed to the planet and would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have worn away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined what CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with the potentially back here\nAnd also what kind of pro somewhat profile are going to Mars or how would you profile a potential candidate a travel on a ship come to Mars what type of personal way looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one of the time of the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun\nUm\nIf you are a far away from the sun is called uh and uh if you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but\nUm\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can't you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay hold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by fast food you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back well ah let them finish up Joe's questions there and they're interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in a moment on coast to coast am\nFeeling lost not by your

by the way are linked up it goes to stand up comic what Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what did they like\n[noise] well um well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise] um I mean quite literally and and some are people that uh\nYou might well one on a crew a ... and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would select to go on a ...\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind\nUm they're the people who you know have a high spirits are fun to be with that sense of humor a you know or not you know a blowout she\nUm and and and bitchy and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong\nAnd people who you know our one for all end all for one\nThat's who you want to take to Mars what's going on with the your August conference you're working on\n[noise] uh well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth\nOkay you know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries [noise] you know it there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November called insight\nAnd it's going to find out how geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll\nProbably have um a discoveries from it um\nThere's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and\nYou will prompt discover thousands what's done I'm ... I'm\nYou know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about uh uh all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have space X people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get blue arching people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to create small launches you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites\nTo do and so small rockets make a lot of sense I'm and I'm\nA I myself I'm involved and design of mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar with for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box um and so little launchers like this could really play a role I'm\nAll right let's take a few more calls for you let's go to the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water\nOn not only earth but on march if you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. M. G. L. dot com like international geo water international\nAnd the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet but the water comes from the back ... below and whatever you got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen auction and make its way to the surface and moved back in areas it'll go ... sure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the same effect is there in fact the largest volcano in the solar system is Olympic moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall just for digits\nThere was a cold beer or on a\n... that's what ... ... ... Scott city or lava flows that happens so that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations for Mars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes we found glaciers and there's probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either organisms flew here from middle chopped up media writes a slow off the planet\nOr or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the skinny I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true\nOr not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could\nWhich either means one of two things\nThat life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough for life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that\nWhen you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit find meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um if life could evolve\nAll the time [noise] um if life could evolve quickly\nOut of chemistry it would have on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before or did so life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that keen for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated\nThey have this whole picture of DNA and are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information um you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that I had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and\nUh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before\nYou know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out\nSo uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that they came here already fully developed it\nCould've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars\nGotten in interstellar space I just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert split Nick that did it for you\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu and while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was\nJust great ah because what it was proving was that the um the space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can remember reading about uh like it a space dog in my weekly reader and later ah I'm ... and ... the next space dogs and you know I'm I have a dog today her her name is ...\nAnd the the struggle was the first off to come back from space alive and she even had puppies and Khrushchev gave one to Jackie Kennedy and um and her descendants are alive today um anyway so um\nI remember that was cool I was a little kid them but I also remember how my parents were horrified over Sputnik was a little tiny thing the size of a basket ball and you know Americans were just panicking how come\nWell because if they could throw it into orbit it means they could throw it here uh in other words ... ... split ... meant they could hit anywhere anymore yeah and it also meant they could throw reconnaissance satellites up into orbit and

I knew we had to hire him [noise]\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population so if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have longstanding allergies chronic pain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light\nFound in my city and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place to get\nAshes [laughter] so these environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's act federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a better antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment the tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAnd they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected are registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also signed saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters\nWhy is that in that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people brand didn't realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things I mean do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in in in when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then they're ... and so forth and so on so this is something\nKind of like most you know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um just\nBy walking into places some people you know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity\nA so these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively to and it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brandon my a criticism of them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of ... leading tone or\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do this three minute one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these uh ...\nYeah I think yeah I think it it it really does too because it implies that either\nPeople are misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine do\nYou know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience it's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type\nOf thing so we we talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes too few ghost more than others but what about the ghost itself I'll do some does that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really\nI guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up ghostly encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio problems from she crane has the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these grossly things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ...\nExactly yeah exactly\nSo you know it and it and that that kind of a boiled down to the environmental sensitive person um they're going to have way way way more goes the encounters and um so I think it has to do fear prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes by and counter the environment\nBut you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff you know I go from place to place to place throughout my day\nHowever one location I'm picking up a lot of um having a lot of goes the phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it\nSo then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon\n... out of the other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit or one\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration as that\nYou know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happened for um the TV to show up in a clear picture\nAnd the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients are variable that line up the habit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point\nBut the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nA consciousness about all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me early\nYeah really is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV him to\nYou know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it that you click in brought into signals better that way too and I taught for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] I remember those two [laughter]\nDo you do or have you come across demonic spirit in your work\nUh no I haven't and I get that question a lot though the the team a question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the\nGood the bad with a positive way that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic mhm\nDemonic team is more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective so usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes I think there's more of a religious pills to it\nUm that's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part of thing so I I really\nJust enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... to ... dot com of course linked up the coast to coast am dot com results show on Facebook\nAnd

these studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites yeah\nSure sure uh so I have several real life accounts that I go over I'm the first one is actually because Halloween is approaching I'll I'll I'll go with this one\nPerson um trick or treat [laughter]\nMy wife had passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself as Halloween approached I was putting up decorations as the kids in the neighborhood usually love trick or treating\nMy wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we had places plastic ... plastic pumpkin and our window every Halloween\nI searched house for days looking for that punk until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and whispered check behind the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably and rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my face as the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf\nSo this\nThis is a a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent haunting ghost interacting with us so in this case you know the ghost during his ghosts and counter the ghost had a conscience\nAnd she was actually giving information that the husband wanted\nSo they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness um they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on this or on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction um his sort of the\n... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters a and these are the most rare ones that I've ... and talking with people these are the most rare\nWhen you have like um the ... in intelligence the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigate the paranormal\nIs Europe pecking order on the other side Brandon in in your opinion of over ... I mean who sends it goes back to do what it does it does it do it on its own or is there some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are\nUm after we die you know what happens to that right or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just seems to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but when you look at things\nIf consciousness survive death and that goes in and it continues to exist\nIt's it could maybe it really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed\nMaybe like ... example with a husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past wife\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a path loved ones and then these experience maybe happen\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs is really important or Michael pursing or who recently passed away if it was a neuropsychologist basically said and he did all the the numbers by ms but that the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln to Billy the kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he was great experiences half of\nWhat do you say the skeptics Brandon who say these people who have these encounters are mentally unstable or something even worse\n[laughter] yeah ... unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy\nAnd they kind of said jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy\nI'm so ... you know what I usually tell people who move skeptics or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed\nMental health and and um you\nKnow you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments on med floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life encounters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who were genuine and had a subjective\nParanormal experience that's huge\nYeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or you're that or your unstable or you're losing aiding or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is\nBut listen to it in my professional opinion a lot of these ghostly encounters are is that there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as a true skeptic has an open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or steadfast skeptic right because you can just\nIn golf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books and it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a ghost or everything is it goes\nIt's being in between and open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read the believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's\nYou know what's fraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part of the central when it comes to being involved in the\nParent on the uptick for I'm pretty much a majority of my life what change do\nYou know I I\nWhen people would tell me and I was really interesting to parents college like I said before but I never had an experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just\nGetting it wrong so when people would tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and ...\nGetting it wrong so when people were telling me experiences I Would kind of sit there and as they are talking I wouldn't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl young collective unconscious retail Drake stuff I'm Harold ... life feels\n... Raman Moody's work\nYes exactly a near death experiences all this stuff\nAnd you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this\nMight be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle man and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then you know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year\nUm but I Know\nEvery year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that come up at the end ESPN the sigh phenomenon is legit and then you're like whoa wait a minute if this is saying this than these ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part a thing\nIt was another one of your favorite storage\nAlright I got a lot of them so uh [noise] we'll go with will go with one that's been pretty popular here recently has to do with the mentioned\nUm and just finished eating dinner and wasn't the kitchen cleaning things up\nAnd that was placing items in the dishwasher I happened to look in the dining room I was shocked to see a huge black void about four feet high and four feet wide hovering above the ground I immediately thought something was terribly wrong with my eyes I looked away rub my eyes and then look back in the void was still there as I Walk closer I could see a mother and child inside the voice\nOur texting and driving [noise] makes people look bad visit stop tax top ...

that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe've got teeth in Rochester New York Yankees going\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent\nWhy people see ghost like others and I've seen the film of the baby ... being fed by humans would hand puppets made to look like the mother still wouldn't return to the wild the tricks noted key in on a mother conduit or are you mentioned the window or who was searching\nFor the pumpkin and his wife appeared and then oh gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three I Will rub my eyes in various ways and all different kinds of\nFigures will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a Kurd would end me a different figures in all different kinds of apps and some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not not ghost by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that lake with a window we're a scene whose wife saying look uh\nUh in the back of the garage [laughter] can't imprint teens can people be so emotionally attached and mentally like a husband who was white that\nHe would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life would be things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah yeah it's ...\n... ... that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not seeing Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars are there's radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio station to Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience has happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing a\n... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious so were all born with these archetypes and the sort of um blueprints\nThere were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted\nUm with with with these archetypes and and what sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar\nSort of vision and stories and things like that so I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families can be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro then macro when it comes to this collective archetypes that are out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nIt does your religion kind of change our views about ah these operations and ... and ...\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes our views and it basically changes our perception of an experience so\nYou know you can have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might perceive that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel\nOr I'm a of of aside from from God or aside from a deceased person that they love\nUm whereas a person who doesn't have that religious tofu it might experience that I simply you know an experience or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so every one\nOf every much past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's why we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bound spirits everything as that are found spirit [noise] ah so I think perception religion or they play a huge part how we perceive a ghost encounters a paranormal phenomenon\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I never witnessed that would you like to [noise] um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know it was somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I kinda like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that\nAnd then someone emails me as a careful what you wish for those types of\nAnd yeah exactly [laughter] so I don't wish\nTo be part of an exercise but scientifically are worth my fascination I loved to sort of be part and sort of gain some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about executions jumps and you know how they can get this demon disappearing demon out of the person's system and you know be gone and it it's really weird and remarkable it's the same time\n[noise]

died sadly in a car crash or but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's ... she's not there anymore oh okay well I'll get your reaction to that Brendan what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this the last ten years but this this idea that you know this is somehow I'm ghosts are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phones\nTax emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich he encompasses a great he he lists a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening\nAnd then there's phantom menace messages which just recently came out as well which goes over this as well it's hard to really know that to me I mean listen this is the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it a ... electric ... electrical equipment has been going on for a while so\nYou know to to know the exact how that's happening I'm not sure\nBut anytime we talked about this and numerous times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency is er similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon can you\nAh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education and there are about what could possibly be happening [noise] ah it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point go start measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable or will which is essentially everything that the scientific method hey I'm for these things are are tough and and that kind of why most people go into its fried or mental illness or imagination um\nYou know we did is not a cop out though to be able to just to see the\nAh I think it's an ... yeah a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is if it's ... if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to\nUm rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say the person's misunderstanding or it's fried earth over active imagination and then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know as as pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures maybe piece\nUm but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in a paranormal investigator is is you got to it's about collecting data about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you got to tell you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and with skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigation of the year and there's\nYou know I don't know\nThree hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variable are of some similarities inconsistencies and then you have measurable phenomenon so you know it's it's\nAnd some similarities inconsistencies and then you have measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue with someone who has a a close mine but if you can just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps you know and that goes for the opposite end to what people are just adamant believers there's\nThere's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom truck driving in Pennsylvania Hi Tom go ahead\nBy how are ya great Tom thank you\nI Want to guide them a long time listener first time caller so bear with me a little bit sure\nOh go story I Am a back in Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen Seventy five I was ten or eleven years old that we didn't your small house and I'll stay here\nAnd I woke up the middle of the night and I don't know why but there was a band standing there and he was a goes with the way that he didn't even hear the Spanish Military uniform\nAnd I'll never forget it I close my eyes open it back up and look at me like a slap myself a couple of times that I felt we weren't studying spoiled or anything like that they close the gap really are open them up and he was dragging my thing\nWas then I close my eyes and he was standing back on the wall Street Journal looked at me smiled but he was funny and I just walked through the wall whoa\nDid the uniform looked like it might have been from the Eighteen hundreds or something like that Tom\nEarly night he had the votes on the shoulders in a home with my fight but I don't know they're very they had you know he had a mustache or we think it was a male\nWas there any kind of battle in that area a long time ago\nI don't think so in upstate New York you know farming community in an old farmhouse what the heck of a you know I don't know I just I've never had another free with anything in my whole life again you're not poor now\nAll right let's bring the expert in Brandon what's a Spanish soldier from the Eighteen hundreds doing their\n... this is this is a\nFascinating story and and these are the stories are really gave me the most excited about this phenomenon right so how could there be a ghost of something that shouldn't be there right so if you have a house for a hundred and fifty years and there's no tragedy happening\nAnd all of a sudden there's a civil war goes that appears there right in this house was I'm In Montana where there shouldn't be civil war goes why\nIs that well I think and and I go over I have a whole chapter devoted sort of that is in my book\nUm you know to me it's not so much location specific when it comes to a lot of these ... things that happen so let's say let's go back to our tele Patrick distress messages right so I'm In Ohio\nAnd um I get into a car accident and end up dying I send a tele Patrick distress message to my brother and a Montana and the if he wakes up in the middle of night season operation of me and my in my clothes while I'm driving or whatever and I say good bye I Love you\nNow the operation didn't happen where I died it happened in Montana where my brother was living right now let's\nSo let's say we skip I had a hundred and fifty years into the future someone buys my brother's house and know tragedy happened there no nobody died there was a it was it was great place to live for all those years they walk into a room and they see an operation of me and they go what the heck is going on here\nNow the operation of me is it because I died and my brother's house it's the endpoint of might tell a path a distress call to my brother that he's picking up on so in that case that the the ... the caller's talking about maybe there was someone that lived in that farmhouse\nWho had um I'm a a a cousin or a family member or perhaps even a husband who was battling in the ... the Spanish Army and that he was dying he sent this past the message that showed up in the form of an operation to this woman in this and the New York farmhouse\nTo support our we're missing deviate novel in\nThe public service message or allies veterans of America and\nThreatening the

to talk about all things space and the next couple of hours Robert welcome back\nMy friend thanks for inviting me always a pleasure have you been\nA pretty good pretty good keeping to think when we go in the march [noise]\nUm at this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sex is pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket\nWhich will be a fully reusable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully be usable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars uh\nAnd if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice because you know you must like to skate next to the edge of the ice to um\nThey got a a blue origin company by a lead by Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so uh we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions Senate space astronomy missions uh\n... their work in that field is epic but ah the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that and um so I think it it's going to be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all\nUm the uh you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic space flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program I mean that storm cabin in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago or a high level NASA official got actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem and what what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYou got and maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can tell people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who do that we went to the moon jump for joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the moon which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add proportion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission\nI mean ... let me tell you what this they called us the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what\nThis the deep space gateway yeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\n[noise] the the the ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal\nI Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon\nTo go there I pass a bill to pass on that they had at the end this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you probably sell me what you buy the swarm play and you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land then with this geez [noise] well\nYou know would be is also doing what he's doing falcon next base sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights in and say it's just a poignant Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nOr an ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class\nIn terms of its ability to execute great projects\nAnd and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan a chaos\nAnd the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while would come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is\nYou know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood\nI was hoping ... Stein would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance to witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another\nTeam back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the sky that night uh the they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time ah because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that Musk has done and creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram\nTraumatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compare to [noise]\nUm what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time\nThat any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were helpless or so okay Bezos has his own money's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the space industry\nWe now have a fusion power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this has just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years in this thinks another Twenty years and but people then say\nMaybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ... and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be in a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours ... coast to coast\nThey always on your own you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized gr mobile users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nAh driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for\nDoing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great themes he wants eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish and\nHe he um and he certainly um\nI'm not above using people uh [noise] and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well why keep getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um that that's the other side of it so\nYou know a ... you know there is [noise] um\n\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great speeches\nEagle about that\nIt's not exactly go it's it's you know if you're reading Greek mythology might be looking at this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know uh uh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core\nTo to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone so you know that's must to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um [noise]\nYou know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must gives a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that as a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant to goes out a ... looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about\nBut you know um\nHow would you come from the just results Robert\nWell Jeff Bezos has much calmer I'm much more laid\nBack um I don't know\nThese shows I met him once uh\nUh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run\nA they reflect that a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um the company takes chances and thus far um they're winning\nUm blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why it is limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know space sexist the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA for the military\nBeing so just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world a and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stocky cheer sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm\nYou know in aerospace a cost just people times time or the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less uh because\nUh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still and whether it's moving\nSo that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries\nBy the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me\nBeen suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth some of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars would have retreated into the groundwater and be there still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes fat is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a\nA north and the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way to same latitude to San Francisco so imagine that there were glaciers\nIn San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that the the latitude\nThat these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think so there's there's two ... there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if it\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nDinosaur bones don't prove that they were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and and and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it it's all been a trick by\nTricky gods and and um I mean it's just absurd um so if you believe that", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year":
