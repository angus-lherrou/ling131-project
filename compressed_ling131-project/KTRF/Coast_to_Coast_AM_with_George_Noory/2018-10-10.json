partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley of former investment banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book an end to upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and Syria's on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you wouldn't initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDoes consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark\nWould always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it and I've always thought no there's something else here which consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the material is science camp which\nSuggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter and when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interaction between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're at you're bound to end up with a self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen\nAnd DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective and if you buy into that which I used to and then when the brain dies\nConsciousness dies memories are gone that when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one dead there is no memory it there's no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in our science and most of science today\nNow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness how in the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was\nAbout two years ago when I first learned\n[laughter] so it was about\nTwo years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that is what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had\nAnd at the end of it her name is Laura Powers she mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on\nDriving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities the ability for consciousness to survive bodily debt things I had no familiarity with an overtime just hearing enough\nDifferent people describing similar perspectives on reality\nI got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real and this was a very\nJarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of\nIntense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in finance and consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened so it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up\nWriting more than half of the book it's now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen\nWith a manuscript and ultimately a cold email Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nAmong the perfect meal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\n[noise] I consider upside\nDown thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggests that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine where I talk about near death experiences\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just a loose nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back into their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking about an end to upside down thinking me or read the subtitle dispelling the midst of the brain produces conscious this\nAnd the implications for everyday life we're going to take phone calls next hour with mark but I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\nSound like a nice is free cognition so let's see how that all works out side of the brain and what's causing [noise]\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members did great show up they didn't connecting with other man's ... to ... dot com slash ... am and we do like but [noise]\n[noise]\n\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell look as a cycle and he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research the new\nIt absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and she came she came out with some astounding things but what did you find it\nYeah it's a lot but these are very important phenomenon it's it's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain\nThat perspective cannot account for things like to laugh at the end the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real\nThe material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work so\n... the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combined the results the statistics\nAre very compelling mhm\nDoctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds that the that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd in telepathy we have six sigma results so the guns thought experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's\nAnother person let's call her Jane who's in another room Jane is given a picture by the experimenter is an experimenter say Jane I Know this sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob\nBob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent\nRight now I'm going to be the ... the last probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent so from a statistical\nStandpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it's suggested something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nSure is that it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or seemed to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the send or having much to do with it I I I think that the receiver\nMight have a better effect didn't change the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic\nOr communications with the deceased through medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw with the U.S government\nUh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be the more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me on the program is sometimes referred\nTo as Stargate Program and use psychic spies for national security purposes many of them wearing I've\nBeen on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm In my book\nI I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently and the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being\nPrimary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes it sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocuments um say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter] so\nI mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world if I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things um\nEven further than that there's a page on science and all and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech the next page in the document says science panel's report\nPrinciple findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have the looked at these uh tell a path to studies and I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies that just that same question and they say no it stopped because they would have kept us on\nThey would have used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of blindness studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark a very valuable tool for people\nIn their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it it's something happens and they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as ... sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a ... dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it\nThat much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nThat basic design is as follows it it reverses what we look at in psychology typically and in psychology the typical study is\nYou show someone a picture let's say at the neurotic image or a violent picture\nWe know that the body will unconsciously respond to it though the skin response the pupils dilate the brain and the heart respond what the pre sentiment pre cognition studies have done it to reverse order where the body is measured before the picture is shown\nThe

now\nThere was no one around no um food now animals that I was by myself and\nI guess I'm I like to know people that are tell a path now you had that people are are usually good with meditation I haven't done a lot of meditation my life but I have been on my own a\nTremendous amount of time I'm at a deep thinker I'm spiritual\nAnd I think I'm an empathetic her so I wanted to know if the

as well\nSeeing something like ... to on the clock I'm thinking of important messages you know something on a point in your life seeing signs\nSo I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nPulling out awhile ago someone had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe in Bible or some religions it's the body and mind here at all\nAnd so I kinda think that what your home is differentiating between the spirit\nOr the other person is it's outside and the spirit inside her or either or but um I I kinda think of it on their level what you're saying as well\nI Would think mark the ... maybe one in the say what do you think\nIt thank you for your question on ...\nUm I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things\nWhich is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness and each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we're fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state and so the water to me is consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a world full or otherwise in the street\n[noise] do you think that's consciousness is a normal process of living or its supernatural\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain's off it's over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness that does not die when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been talk to me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences\nWhat people often report is known as a ...\nYou go but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review where they experience their whole\nLife in a flash and again this is when their brain as either offer highly impaired and they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life but this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report\nExperiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material good so it will be talked about meeting in life life review as a potential land if we take that and the literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness pre cognition telepathy and things like\nThat well yeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's the subtle ability even people in people who aren't trained\nI think there are ability that are just simply not harnessed in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book and felt compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science in our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\n[noise] are you doing sir great I'm an ex\nMilitary and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was a cyber multinational unit two thousand six in Iraq\nBut by the way you think you were serving first night where\nYou get that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand if he remote viewing from a section of the three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a bus and some building\nWere able to find that very UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in a was ball and I believe he was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get of who I dealt with over there\nMhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and the access to water that outside\nI wanted to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir I'm ...\nSo you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things that I dealt with

Margo ... market can we concluded that consciousness is a part of the universe always was\nAnd that it survives outside of the physical brain the physical body but it's there it's out there in the east or I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we've discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like till after the cycle can eat as pre cognition\nNear death experiences children with half light memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's they get that consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show continues bussing thinking it was wonderful really wonderful and my uh my question is all you can get another got tons of callers a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us\nOn the so AKA consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil how just free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nFree will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the body having free will are we talking about like the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water\nThan all there is consciousness so at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of\nPerhaps at an individual that is\nConsidering itself to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free well did not exist at the same level that that makes sense\nYeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about night I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exist that we can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit of understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to ... with us how to use it a Andy Andy used it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might have interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's off the he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nOr we have a guest his name's Joseph a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of a doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and ... and ... and he said it's uncanny so if somebody goes into Las Vegas\nUpbeat positive uh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are uncanny I think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nKnow I'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness than the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... Ah yes real quickly before oh make my favorite I like the uh\nRespect of this disagree with ah that age is a view about the effects of a drug this Bush in the on the mind or you know it's an indicator that consciousness is a product of the mine ...\nI'm a you know as you the person speaking into a tape recorder as an example\nUm you know if that example would be a consciousness and uh the play back of the tape recorded a you know if the typing wrinkles clinical those something will end up playing it just started a voice or you know this notion that would be an example of the drug mine\nYou know it's not the consciousness but that's the fact of the apparatus this I'm\nBringing about a distortion cope with consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know of the wholesome of consciousness that went into it uh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a\nA spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a the example of active consciousness uh this this thing outside of the by that I'm able to live with paid have knowledge of events that\nYou know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise a tele could nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness\n... and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness outside the body right there what do you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased when is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind bridge Research Center and these studies\nAre use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased is\nSpeaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to\nBring in non chance information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this thing Jeff thing that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of someone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think of some mediums do you think are some of them are very effective\nUh erasing an important point I think there's a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that have\nReal abilities and the wind ...

you know ... century\nYou know we investigate and a lot of time that you know ...\nCentury afraid that you're dealing with the you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome

so I'm not\nGoogling information eager for\n'em so one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take an hour\nYou know so yeah exactly I'm sure I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I said oh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home it's just you know

TV show slash investigation and uh I realized there were a lot of things even though I have a good science background that I couldn't explain and I was curious and were furious I got the more I did it and eventually I began doing it fulltime\nAnd you lost that I Do because they still\nNot sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nSo you've got a degree and environmental science yeah you were\nOn the moon program as well\nAre you interested in in in ... you were a skeptic but now you're a believer ... you've made this full circle how far are you on the other side now that you believe this\nYou know I Believe there's something out here I Believe in an afterlife do I believe that\nEverything icy and and it's you know always skeptical bite my science spring I guess you want to call it a grounding brain always you know makes me out what's going on and I've had a lot of unique experiences but uh [noise] isn't enough there that I Know that the experiences happening but\nAre they really paranormal already you know\nSomething else match in Asia or something I just can't explain\nWhat keep striving you why do you keep doing this\nThere's a lot of reasons the primaries is to try to understand that more I Try to understand all aspects of the ... just like going in as a you know\nWell to give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that all mediums for shower things like a gypsy said to the beach with fourteen telling and\nUh when I met more rain I was pretty much the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they got what they do and uh so that's kinda my whoa aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything I'm always open\nMy whoa aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything I'm always open minded enough to at least try to understand if I'm going to criticize it I got to know as much as they can about it to do that so that's kinda how I Am more open minded but still it got that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\nA marinas is very unique and and you know there are a lot of mediums out there and [noise]\nBut uh woodworking with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff in in a trance channel courses it's those skills the crap out of most people who see it so uh yeah I you know I definitely she believes she has some type ...\nDo you run across a lot of people like her in what you do better yes and I used to live there has to\nMeet him lots of mediums lots of them yeah\nI mean and we you know I also do a lot of studies for instance the physical medium ship is it something that's always fascinated me in and of course for those who don't know there are two types of a medium ship mental mania ship or a disparate speaks supposedly speaks through\nThe use them like ... ... Whoopi Goldberg and that the movie ghost\nThat well that's a chance to meet him in and but uh that's still the disparate works through a medium versus a physical medium ship which the spirit comes into our around and actually moved stops for ...\nI like the Patrick Swayze that same movie where they moved the coins not\nThose pennies moving stuff right so I I've been", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "10"}
