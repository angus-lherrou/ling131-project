chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization kinds of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and ... with the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow is it like a cubicle or ... and ... and a decline or well how do you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can if you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that\nBecause you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions it's like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flow chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and\nAll the sound is piped into the room\nWe use special technologies like him he sank\nYou hands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nSo they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated I mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on on you know they\nThey're listening through headphones an exercise minor typical you about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey you'd have a friend who see this several times um where where do you think now anything sense of all the technology is the mine are all the time to get someone into a beta hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course\nAre ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by nor will be technology it's been around for a long time and it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey where would you and I know that anything\nPattern that you can't keep up to it it kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or the relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative\nType of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with a program and um and have your own experience everybody has different experience\nDuring even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have\nTheir own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have pets why for aggression mhm they have contact with all kinds of let's just say a non physical\nBeing different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up\nTo our inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say eye opening and mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea\nIs to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self what's that going to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow what types of questions could you ask yourself and then do you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery 'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they are waking to their their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then I mean in a way you're expanding you William have died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend mine I freeze has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered shows that need help and I think that's fascinating and you can't do that that that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mean need assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well\nOr where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and ... there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm\nAt ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses\nOn that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist them in the crossing over have you ever done this after a [noise] a tragic incident and national tragic incident where a mask it's still really don't want\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact\nAh during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office and suddenly your entire body is gone\n... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people\nThat were shift in those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions and different names and different cultures\nAnd Institute\nWe we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can\nThat goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's um understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience and all that I went to find out a little bit more about one of the culture or does this and what it calls and other cultures\nAre going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what kind of consciousness exist and and also a little bit more on how you can you on your own and it was like that but my guess William ...

I mean this is just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional beings that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very\nPeriod of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional\nAnd that death is an illusion really I'm no no that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed and you're doing this face to face\nThis is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you were in power to\nDiscover the answers for yourself\nAnd really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody and like I show and you know the ... the grandfather and Clinton to turn a life after death and\nUm [noise] she had expressed to me after Fifteen Years doing that\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life after death exists because scientists agree it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who live here in his life after life\n... ... he killed a dozen as a scientist as a ... right now I Know for sure yes\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get\nThat verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books you\nYou can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the insight and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are ... and to get away from this bickering and confusion and division\nI mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being added you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development it puts everything into a whole different perspective\nAnd I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist up and saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that rain and then he cleaned the term I think

I'm a belief system mhm\nThat of course is nothing but fear here is a control mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population a and it still used today right actively unfortunate way to control um ... you know society\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared and ... is that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nI it sounds a little grandiose playing\nYou know that you know my God I'm\nMore than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and\nForget about tiny problem in life that you feel are still large because our brains make and that way but truly they are insignificant when you compare and two\nHouses down our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond our body\nYeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience you you you can no longer be manipulated by\nThese external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you know the answers for yourself\nAnd you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his analytical news that we\nHadn't ridiculous and that's and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ...\nThat's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars or be not never shaft none of that would occur\n... because we would know better\nChance we really truly knew we were all connect and there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that are connected to [laughter]\nDo we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we are going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls to simply to give us a call and I only think I Need to take a stand [noise]\n... ... email newsletters sent out six days a week it is a great way to keep up on all things goes\nWith detailed program recaps the fascinating today in St Louis the upcoming just didn't vote and weekly free audio clips it must have caused fans look for the ... sign up on the coast to coast am dot com ... me\nBut what is your question they fan\nI'm curious as there's any relevance between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nThe question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory in Austin general\n... a coalition a little bit of both the uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not interfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall a certain things that you use all the time so to speak like we're in stuff like that and drive and things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory and on and and um she's when you have a brain trauma type not so much the out of body technique it doesn't serve their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I have not seen any correlation for that I have um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences\nHave incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that have written many books I'm\nIn their later years let's say [noise] so if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to ah remember end to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added ...\n... you know the student them than\nI can relate to the same thing when you're trying to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah ... ... myself poll or whatnot with no functioning so\nGreat now that's great thank you so much for the phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body channels and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't she is with the TV I any type of trauma or a brain injury we want to avoid those they\nThey are not sign no no\nUh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do\nA for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death but the two were actually\nThough ... obese are part of the near death experience there are also independent of that so it's important a distinction to make\n... interesting um I go to Dave in New Jersey I allowed kindling for Hi Dave how are you tonight\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] All right so\nThis is where it might get a little weird but I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called west town Pennsylvania we moved there when I was about to when I started getting visitation\nThere were these patients they gave me um I first saw of a day I kept with the school\nWhere I fell down on the scale load by hands both find days where there's all those two girls in their mouths withdraw ice skating it happen ... would be the one I saw the night before and the Dow but all they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar own\nFascinating is very cool so can be deeply competent is ...\nIs a cat and um\nThere are multiple um experiences and reports of\nPeople that have ah let's just say knowledge of events are not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nAs we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experiences quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it\n... in non physical reality\nIt's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical\n'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise] uh and that's why it's important to begin to read or least learn about how non physical reality functions\nAnd fascinating can you ask in a long it takes you called ... and\n... can you asked in going into and out of body experience and media destiny question or\nHow to figure something out that really going into the future more than he giving out your parents\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I tried to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that\nIt wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there is no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit\n... but have you ever ask yeah that's great I'm Glad\nShe did she are a wildcard line to berry in St Louis Hi Danny how you\nHi Lisa thanks for taking my call\nI had a question you your guest um years ago while we were out of town I did I ever really close to the past suddenly while we were out of town and um\nI go back and I just didn't let my last few him to be in a casket so I didn't go off and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was back at least by the time\nAnd I was chasing the suspect for a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not but it was my dad ... and I said to him\nRight there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... him I said to him I just said dad and he he held those hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle down and it's okay and uh I I Want to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I even said to him I said dad don't lead pleased to leave and he was gone and I woke up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream of that because I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually I ... I mean from the ... you know life after death settled down because it actually works\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream logic experience\nUh the universe it's a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high ... and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experiences but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid or contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact and that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing yes\nIt is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right near San ... in a way to you remember him rather than any casket and I think that's a really wonderful intention and he basically did this technique intentionally and think thank you for sharing that\nUm [noise] let's give it to me yes um west of the Rockies you've got great in Louisville, Kentucky [laughter]\nHey how're you doing laser great how are you\nHow I'm doing okay it's a it's called birthday [laughter] our third date the safety of Ford makes me fifty five\nBecause every mindful action ...\nAnd they'd all them\nTo you can join the narrative youthful at ... dot org together we can do youthful\nMystery unfold and get out the vote I'm more of a coup that President Trump said we will be punishing ourselves by canceling arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of a Washington Post journalist at the consulate in Istanbul\nBut he also said the Saudis should be punished if officials are connected to the disappearance of democracy Yogi congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut agreed\nI would've use different words and the president use this is not us really punishing somebody were not an international court were not some kind of global parents what we are or at least should aspire to be to be out front and leading on basic values and ethics built killed journalists anywhere much less than a foreign country [laughter]\nLike broke out in downtown Portland Oregon is clean hotel with a right wing group and counter demonstrators police in riot gear were to break up fights\nAnd used pepper spray to try to control the crowd small community in upstate New York came together for the funeral for several victims of last weekend's deadly limousine crash course honesty casting bombs in the service was held for sisters and their husbands as well as a friend\nPhotos of eight of the victims were placed at the front of Saint Denis last Roman Catholic church in Amsterdam earns containing the remains were at the altar hundreds of people packed into the small church those being mourned included four sisters three of their husbands and a friend to more funerals will take place on Sunday\nA sea of people thousands strong took to the streets of downtown Chicago chatting let's go vote with many expressing their displeasure at President Trump the march to the polls event was largely a push to get women and young voters to make their voices heard on election day\nTerms are so important\nAre going to you last year that is going to be free you our governor our house representative senator\nDoes your basement or crawl space a damn must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation and that\nCould mean increased mold growth and build up a harmful toxins gases don't bother with the humidifier just circulates the same on healthier now there's a better way to remove these dangers in odors it's with the computerized way ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expelled pollutants\nWith the computerized wave ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expelled pollutants with we've units there are new buckets of water or filters and they ... a day to run wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask about our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit\nPlus a six page portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit drawing house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom iffy on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nOh [laughter] I\nThought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it well she started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like OSU made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue [laughter] you know\nInnocent but then uh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it in my first book haunted mandatory springs I changed the name\n[laughter] okay the people and how old was your nephew advertising at this time next okay and\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks\nAnd he was bleeding K. he was bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hand and I ran down to his room and he had to cut the ear off of our cat\nAnd he said that still made him do it oh dear\nYou said stew I'm Sorry he\nKept calling it's due this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had a speech impediment and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners\nName the one that died now\nOne that did not liked me anymore right for and before oh\nIt was awful he said to me stupid doesn't once you any here any more [laughter]\nAnd then how when did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just to me even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ...\nWe had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that\nOh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that's silly\nStew he stole something again you know and I might find all my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway\nAnd it was just kind of ... and the beginning and and and fairly innocent but what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or men knows I'm just going to say\nThat what what we ended up finding out was that it was it puts on a portal [noise] it is it's it's really strongly haunted still\nAnd you are still living there no milk no\nAfter five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level and we took the doorbell out that the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level and off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of that place what would happen to him\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen [noise] on a ledge was voted\nNumber six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post who would buy something like that um it actually you know what to talk about talk about\nTrue beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist a Buddhist\nRetreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they clear at all the spirits away and that the houses happy again so I Am really\nWould take a lot of work\nBut they have done so much work than men with ... experts and they uh they changed the gardening they change the direction of certain you know\nAnd they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nI don't know that really works\nIt apparently at work because it it it's free\n[laughter] fascinating about a hundred\nYears yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later\nAfter you know me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house was so hot that [noise] and I don't get into that right now but I\nDid find out that there was the reason they're always at any time something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or Bruins if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old and so\nUm they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough\nUm is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never thought of those when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal and I really believe it was because he just didn't want to [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor for like he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he tells his friends do ya my step mom's to go ... [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally\n[laughter] oh it has to be validated yeah\nOh yeah he believe me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in managed to springs right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone and I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah\nOh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of the ... springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we had in my house is shaking my head and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious but the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up ... um you can feel\nIt um and the other thing that curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies um Nikola Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing spring it was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense the ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they had birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it was the he was saying he was the lady that may be because of the magnetic anomalies the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like ... how the pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing your Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am Lee cigars you're listening to coast to coast am\n\n\nIn\n\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever and tell the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um\nNatural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so haunted\nMakes sense to me [laughter] yeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do and you like it\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here\nI Am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nFor you to body it was awful he's and he was suicide\nCome to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking\nTo people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um process and they\nThey don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artist answer singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't eat it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved\nHere a and I see it happening to other people would I warned them my a godsend\nMoved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help them out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and the bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit of mandatory Wilber took him and he goes I can\nFeel it I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well you got to be

you're not allowed to leave and nice you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you come here because it's a choice\nYou Martin summoned to this town and I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs hallways the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh I Am\nStories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or something that might be\nVisiting you ... what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to move to transition want to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies\n[noise] now I I Want to ... this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe that's ferret lingers that they stay here some people believe that\nThree days or so that maybe that spirit linger it's that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not have both [laughter] um\nOther stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\nBecause it's usually own that particular place and I didn't\nSee I earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and\nThat I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history and anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before\nWhen I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they were howling like going on I think that's a residual it's like a burp in time you know quantum physicist and explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast you can still smell the front so\nIt's gone yeah\nI live in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this to mention temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness who you mean by that mean that was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense I didn't have a conscious it's yeah it's just music that I heard like\nThey came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the train that used to run behind my house and Senate ran in over a hundred years yeah\nSo yeah when I hear so I don't know the other people\nDo [laughter] you have anybody around that you could ask me\nWho are in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on it and\nMove on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it as I Swear it works but would you ask\nI tell it are you you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones that are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind of person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get hot here it's it's really sad if you think about these those centers that go out and our teasing them like they're like they're like in the zoo or\nSomething you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those hunting is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we've all been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world of possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen\nBlows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby\nImagine that you know so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] other people have had a\nHabit enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now tell me which do you started this wonderful convention this paranoia ... mentioned travels to various areas tell us a little bit about it\n[noise] well um we call it a moot movable fees like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historian and the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate\nWe are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of and he does we're here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\nThere's such a germ yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter] these\nSo when you do the ... you have a group that comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little\nInformation on there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tourists do change night by night and you never know which spirit is going to come out and play quite interesting\nYeah does that do stay with specific date and time and all that you think are not as validate it\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tour okay\nThere are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called those kind of has much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch a darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes you'll it'll be hot and you'll
