I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic cryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it will be but\nI think the other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said too but it's been a a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or\nYou know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movie\nSee that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea [laughter] I couldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely\nOh I Know absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about ... I in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day\nNo these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... they we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing\nIs the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the ... song a giant I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla\nAnd and the the the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approach on this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based\nAnd ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion\nOf not just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there to show you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give him credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise] um they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can\nUh reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe our perfect base in their\n... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew\n... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot now if you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are brilliant\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nI explored Hindu wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like a pie or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic but\nAnyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of\nFaith faith I'm a Christian and I take my my faith very very seriously and so\nWhen I say we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system\nIs I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets the faces of some there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next ... the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... next on coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\n[noise] about the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for them what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know ... and never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there's such a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of the technology that that ... aims at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elite\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it and we're taking\nIt as a behind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people in Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nWell I figured if the late night show so\nI'm trying to lay down on that one okay asleep\nBut you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know it ties at the white you said what but uh [laughter] but um\nBut I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape for this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executive uh and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging as ... ... ... lives in ... ... because yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophies\nRight it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point [noise]\nI I'm more thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment\nAnd the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example\nWhen you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could you know a ... quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff\nYou know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to do it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside\nWhen in fact\nWhen Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always\nLike plane a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious has said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he\nJust not just a job and you know he has though [laughter] I was appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nRight now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah\nIf you're in physics at college and now you're not [laughter] but no job\nFor him but yeah it ... I I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the\nEarth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed to work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know a a you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science\nSure um ... what what were you learn is that uh the species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that didn't that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as\nAs as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know why\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum face they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it up\nAnd now here's an age now let me ... is a little differently yeah I get there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow the evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nThe fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand laid these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know there's going so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that barren Brunner back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles [noise]\nUm but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we start making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be that's the one I think again super well to use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... I didn't become done right scary because who is going to be making these decisions\nOnce that technology becomes more facile\n[noise] yeah yeah you're you're you're raising a good point you know I Do talk about these the extinction efforts\nThat are going on right now I'm that ... primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nAnd I I remember when I was at ABC News I was actually invited to come to Russia where there there there were a group of scientists I think the French guy was in charge of the group as I recall and he wanted me to come up with covered the story I never got around to doing it I got busy doing other stories but\n\n[noise]\nSuspects pass a rival angry existing conditions I'm Barton metric of fifty six year old Florida Man Caesar say is facing federal crimes charges in\nConnection with more than a dozen package bombs to critics of President Trump\nThe director made it clear the packages contain improvised explosive devices\nAnd the bombs were no hope unraveling Cynthia rats\nAre giving a dark history and that makes nine of including our company according to police report of a warning would be it could also be making some actually get people in the media Twitter account maybe Iraqi journalist\nEven when I can pretty stressing me over today's arrest\nDoesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be under packages in transit now before they pass the recording for President Obama hit the campaign trail for democratic candidates and speaking in Milwaukee zeroed in on what he called President Trump's allies when it comes to a promising to protect\nResisting conditions in health care [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nPut a positive thing that's why\n[noise] MGM resorts international decided to enter a sentiment talks with plaintiffs\nWho allege negligence legit the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history on the Las Vegas strip the agreement to seek mediation comes after a federal court panel denied the casino giants requests decentralized their dream lawsuit\nStemming from the October twenty Seventeen concert massacre I bought neck or [noise]\nAre you looking but senior care for your mom or dad but I don't know where to start Hi I'm\nJohn Lennon with a place for mom nobody knows your parents or loved one better than you and nobody knows senior living better than the experts at a place for a mom it's a free service and we've helped thousands of families find the right place for their mom or dad there's a place for answers place her mom called today\nCall a place for a mom at one eight hundred three seven nine Elevens Seventy four that's one eight hundred three seven nine eleventh Seventy four\nSpring showers bring more than flowers they also bring that familiar must be smell to your basement usually caused by too much moisture molds and mildew don't bother with the humidifier\nIt just circulates the same on healthy air now there's a better way to remove damn most of the air and harmful pollutant it's with the way moisture control unit wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed for more information visit a\nDry hole one two three dot com that's dry hole one two three dot com\n[noise] the U.S economy grew at a robust annual rate of free and a half percent in the third quarter was correspond to Jim Johnson reports\nThe strongest burst of consumer spending in nearly four years helped offset a drag from trade and Commerce Department says the figure came in slightly higher than what many economists a projected but it was still down somewhat from the four point two percent second quarter growth rate\nTogether though the two porters mark the strongest consecutive measurements since two thousand fourteen\n[noise] a marijuana trade group projects that pot friendly policies\nAnd tourists oriented Las Vegas in Reno could make Nevada one of the nation's largest marijuana marketplaces by twenty twenty four\nIt finds pop production processing and sales could reach more than a billion dollars in tax revenue for Nevada over seven years I'm ...

St Bernard I can only tell you one thing the product war and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy and it gives me like Tallahassee care and I and my how\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and\nThere's at least one guy and Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAnd there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember\nI'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart\nTransplant sure you remember that a a Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like\nThat and um everybody cringed at oh my God way way putting them which led a mechanical hard in a human being and the you know\nWas in South Africa right and yeah a ... and ... and ... and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on um we were even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in\nA you talk about things that give me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but\nOkay there you are\nNo you know the minute University of Minnesota's a monster recently been huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why this gives me an article but\nAnyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... really there shape human and pick human ... so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been it together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pick DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility not discuss the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs\nRight if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now\nBecause of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting\nIs that these guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like you know made up the pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is a possibility but they're\nDoing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government is number one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even an I. H. it's kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking of funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails\nAre well I'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just doing it in violation of the agent probably doing it against the advice of their moms [laughter] what do you\nDo yeah yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... says the town over\nAnd I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nKnow ... I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to see what happens that's the only thing that I was eight in a little mad scientist and they yeah\nWalk just to see what happens ethic and I was a little mad scientist and they\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the way\nThat they can marry you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I get it right in that already go so quite tiddlywinks if something safer\n... ... ... as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA\nYou kidding me know so I thought I didn't mean standing fifteens\nInning game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like taking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of works and so I don't know I guess it I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it happened to go right now still there's two men on\nAnd the top of the fifteenth and where will keep an eye on it so sorry Joe ... the the island to Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is\nBut I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know for his theory you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look at a windows Siri is it snowing you know or you know Google ... by ...\nBy me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials at everybody's focused on that type of it's just like kind of get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downside of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell\nThe story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me you know there's a dollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents are totally clueless stuffed starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now are you\nKidding me I mean that could take away having leaders [laughter] yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and\nAgain I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe it there in the Saudi ... they have a they have Google and they had the little theory whatever and they monitor that way\nBut however it happened that kind of the debt that passive listening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our cut a country I just had an op ed that it will be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nBigger than just the kind of a that'd be refrigerated or your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than eight billion Internet\nOf things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplishes because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch [noise]\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join the mystery\nThe end of life as we know it Michael Guillen [noise] next uh coast to coast am in for George ... on it [noise]\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nSure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are spying on every aspects of our lives they can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate\nUh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there are that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than\nWe are well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked a lot of them I mean I were an apple watch by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week [laughter] exact same\nThing they took it from the real life oh did you know they always do\nYou know ripped from today's headlines too but that's where I mean I\nI think that they like to catch a killer is one thing when people listen to all good they kind of killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRunning a that they've not you're covering the yeah\nAnd and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy\nRun with which raises the possibility\nThat you and I can have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere\nAre saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a ... a screen up\nA McGill in the end of life as we know it let's get two key who's in Virginia on coast to coast am Keith\n[noise] hello can you hear me in a perfectly good a knife on my own turned back up to go and\nGet a question from Michael\nYes Michael and I argue or speaking about the ah Jarvis cart\nHave a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh but it'd be great to have him on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things I'm One of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a of\nA heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery at some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's as if ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions said he was able to see him on his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to 'cause I Know we have our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of belong\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracey\n[noise] yeah I got one question for you here where does it and where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we that's a good question but are we playing God yeah and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs to now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or\nThat can really within right there but it was everything else\nI think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or aren't we\nOdd premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease if the disease is natural it was as God made it natural and the earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase\nRightly that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant\nI I mean that can be said we're playing ... for ... what I like to do is what I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story\nYou remember when they lift the oilfields on fire oh totally I what\nI was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew away through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI see as their icy as navigating a mine field and you know so far we've\nBeen able to avoid a stepping on that one mind it's gonna do it in\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\nOkay remains to be seen I think that will be the end if it if it comes that way but now I Am committed okay\nSo you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics [noise] let me just give you\nWhat I think is a better metaphor though for for science in is is we had to get you had you know let's say the the goal was the other side of that minefield [noise]\nWell you just simply going to have to say there are going to be X number of scientists are going to have to run through that minefield and enough scientist run through the minefield the goal will be achieved [noise]\nYou know that there will be some casualties along the way as their inevitably are the the the premise that I'm most worried about is not whether we get blown up in the mine field\n[noise]\nFederal case Hamilton spending I'm Barton neck or a fingerprint and DNA evidence led to the arrest of fifty six year old a six year old man from Florida for allegedly mailing packages

and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching a that we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had\nA profits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and we're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I basically\nTo wrap it up to be a turtle man is one concept that he spoke about any taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman Napster and there's a very good Youtube video Jennifer Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles\nSeem to than Boston by you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures had been lost that that were the basis of the creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars to sort out um [noise]\nBut that's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends who were LDS so [noise]\nThat'll be conversational ... iced tea\nSplurge have little caffeine or All right so a coming up next our that are more shy next to have a more open line calls will give you all the numbers you need tickets wherever you want to take his coming up next on coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nYet but the thing of the ... moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it a ... but the scissors independence or the ... and this little cup holder whose district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making an argument like maybe the jar was on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh\nBut I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled you guys I'll go with that until it got any other theory too\nSo yeah benevolent pulled their guy so I'll go with that until it got any other theory to a a back in a ... show is in Wyoming on coast to coast am Michele\nHow high fencing and I'm Sorry I'm Around not like they're all\nFirst things first the first things first [noise] if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second okay I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you\nWhat I was wondering why it's\nLike I was raised as a Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that's that's the way I have inside an room hair gas Michael I'm crossing and when you first got on\nHe was talking about that you know that scientific side of\nHim and and the way that lady\nTold her to read the Bible and now it's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't have a very strong with religious staff exactly but um\nIt's a little bit like I ... I Wonder\nHow often when I'm driving down the road and how they can trust the authenticity of the Bible because [noise] you know [noise] I have often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of a you know like a [noise] a savior\nOur hero type stay on the line of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call tax you know like ... ... talk for like ... and ... you know whatever creates the Bible Sao\nYou're talking about the ...\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise]\nUm and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God a ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me\nAlways is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it is my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up\nBecause I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay\nThere's a there's a difference to me\nAnd there are truly does that we know to be a worse steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories tell the truth the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest the\nBible it failed it you know story that can be found in other places we can still try you're saying like the other information on the bottom\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who when Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr the other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it do you can you do you live your life better it does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science\nThere's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nOkay let me think of that let's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas\nAnd there's a lot of time out here to thing foul [laughter] good\nWill be a big help your bed ma'am a gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad your was your first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a adjusted who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey and it's nice to be on my list and that river river actually call them or have you going to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but I Do whatever you want to get to some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people\nCarpet on mosque interview a he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd when he smoked ... yeah they're\nThey're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is a\nVery logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful Wayne says things about like a a guy and a side of an addict augmentation\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around\nYou know we have the ability you know the massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just take a loss of classes to learn how to properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those [noise] no I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built into\nThem you know it's just a fine arts credits that people just take\nThe right to it 'cause it's not that it's dance you know or something so advanced at least ... you don't have to\nGo [laughter] but you know to your point on on a mosque I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions are big I'm big on student ability\nUm uh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that reveal much more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must get some big giant slot machine\nYeah somebody and then you whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I own\nVenus is are you know or at your body that that's a very intellectual it always has some kind of inner struggle\nAnd so I'm a I I'm an investor actually a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh\nIn interviews and uh and has recovered mostly what I live in a day or something like that one effect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in ... mosque\nRight I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the ... minutes interview in\nHis dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and to make a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching the\nWheels are going to eat and just like watching a Tesla the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so\nI'm I I think anytime the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree with you use it to ingenious\nI think you suppose and stuff a little more on it in ... on public but I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very soon future you know blame it on the Web based in two thousand Nineteen you know what I mean right now than it is\nBut they were mentally getting more technical logically advanced we have robots now and we have all that

the way\nHow ... how do you invest you get into\n[noise] okay um okay you know ordering experience or a fish\nYou know okay a un contacted yeah okay\nWell that's how I investigate as far as validating law vetting what I come up to ... what kind of ... um what kind of information I get [noise] 'cause I have to check out everything\nAt least from two different sources\nAnd her mother and her friends as well say maybe a knowledgeable in this area\nBecause it's a very compelling idea that that uh maybe if we're if we're worried on this planet that artificial intelligence could overrun us and deprive us of our humanity and eventually\nMake us into something other than what we are this is a servant to to some ... ... is that if that ... that can happen here that we're worried about why do we think it could happen\nSomewhere else and another and I think it's actually a really great idea for a movie but I think that's really it's really interesting\nYou might want to consider what if it did happen somewhere else and it came here and now it's running it's game on us and we're building the very thing that it is\nI'm game I'm In great uh interesting I'm thinking about that I was thinking about it before I go to bed tonight or I won't sleep but I don't think you'd better over a cup of coffee tomorrow or let me go to a Tom who's in the Bronx and coast to coast Tom\nHow are ya I I like to say that the cloud that's going around Mars [noise] yup is a good possibility that every once in a while\nMaybe there are like ... ... does it like old volcanoes are more as it may be the uh they start to fire up like a boiler\nAnd maybe it froze off like a like almost creating like a temporary atmosphere may be it's trying to develop a Mars and these are volcanoes might go cold\nAnd the and it never succeed in creating a fool atmosphere\nInterested as a good possibility\nI totally totally and completely accept that as a possibility diverge idea yeah let me go to Wal who's in Pennsylvania on coast to coast am on a wildcard line before the bottom of the hour wall\nBlow up ... and it's nice to talk to one [laughter] I think you know why I\nWanted to say something about the border but you started talking about the Bible and uh I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I suppose subsequently become an atheist agnostic down not so I don't know what to say that you really\n[laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that way but it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's a space I live in I live in a space during the week so they kinda bleeds through the air I'm afraid if\nYou shut off when you said that job you know people come out of church and they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because ah\nI Can't possibly believing in God that show hypocrite or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other God's up\nYou know in the Bible up you know I can I possibly even wages whoa but when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about high Schober worrisome the age of ... first born Egyptians or the great flood\nOr Saddam ... more of their own data innocent children killed there so I mean yeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative as being the defining story\nSo I accept what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the but to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so\nYou know everybody puts their faith in something let me just\nPut it that way well everybody puts their faith in something [noise] put your faith and money put your seats in sex\nBut your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make you happy\nAnd some people put their faith and having the perfect body or or that they that they're going to have the perfect career and that's how they build the structure of their life around that that's really what their God little she becomes [noise]\nPerfectly fine [noise] I mean that's freedom people will do that I don't see anything wrong with that it's just not how I Choose to do it and then we'll just leave it there so half hour hey gosh darn it we're almost done we could open lines coming up next the coast to coast am this is the ... [noise]\nI don't know I Am a question about it right but pediatric Janet the addition that I bought it because it lasted the second to last for the first one to ask are you in Manhattan, Kansas now\nNot yet but he's asking I'm just I'm I'll be there soon I Am still back in the boxes I'm Still in Phoenix with the time being but I'm getting there\nOkay I looked from mission hills Kansas to younger line and so I I Know where you're going to treat you well\nWell it's funny I have a I have a property and I have a property in view for\nUm South Carolina no I Love that area I feel I don't ... I don't get there very often but one of these days on drugs\nHave my I'm a Hilton Head wondering oh yeah we're neighbors OK\nWell previous caller brought up something about I think he got it up a website where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure I'm let that go figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was elected they asked now\nThat's what it was yeah and and that's what that's what I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elections and I've got to that part\nBut yes he did say that and so immediately triggered in my brain I bought this perfect set of Encyclopedia Britannica from\nThe church mouse [laughter] or and I was so excited and when I got at home I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for a\nFirst part the first introductory part and it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan\nWow ... ... ... you're going to if you haven't stand is he would probably ... by\nThose down and explain at this with a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica and they created\nThe alphabetical values and they they chose to put it at length in that heart and then they end that the other selections at their discretion\nAnd so when you look at Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica\nHas just a few little paragraphs and it it costs to them that that go figure someone who might have live during a certain time period and then it represents there's a way to look in the ... or more information and then if you try to Islam\nIt is like page after page after page in the regular section and still do you know anything about it\nNo it's very interesting that's very ... those are good looking over your shoulder will you talk to you you're doing that it's\nIn it's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and that kind of feel\nLike like they're not really\nEven [laughter] you don't you don't see the wrong here you do to reduce the idea\nThat I mean like the as you said I\nI I Know there are still printing they must still be printing a version of you know they done completely they don't want anything to\nDo that after the second to the laugh in slow to buy it gave them hung up or at home and all that and I started looking up things and I thought why their kids and they get this land so yeah you find out I mean if you could do home or on\nThe subway you could look at that I'm breathing treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night or I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to ... if I Do it'll be in the first hour tomorrow night\nAn otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again Thanksgiving so it may have to wait a while but let me see what I Do but thank you it's really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen who is in Alaska on coast to coast AMA Karen\nHi um this link and was she was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gas and um it the show was short um first of all I wanted to stay you are by far my favorite show host and has to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though because all they do that [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about where they just you know\nYeah you know I I I guess that is funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you know you will your nose to say that oh no trail like what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things I don't get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where um than Mandela Effect\nFirst of all you've probably heard about it there yet not knowing loss of memory to yeah we'll ask about all these things called memory and everything in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not an end last night the example they gave with them I Believe it was like they are having sex in the Bible the wolf and the lamb\nVersus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb\nThat a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible you can find a gift to what I got catalog in the mail today [laughter]\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like minded I don't know for our comfort her sister\nRemember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it so Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um\nAnd your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um things that have changed life with like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolate Sally Field do you remember when she\nReally liked me you might me are right right now they're saying\nIf you watch it now says he says he really liked me now\nOkay that's interesting when\nYou know when he was saying encyclopedia\nHow you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all on that last night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that there may be that there they said something about their goal was to make a\nI don't know portal into another dimension ... think demon into our\nYeah well they were doing say panic rituals outside that place\nI'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and ... as we all know what he does you know the things he believes in the many way the\nOther things then we would do she'll still be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it will nightmares more but here's here's what I Want to IRS when I propose to do the ... the thing I mentioned\nTo you about Islam and above bendel and about Mohammed\nIs that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory into ours and and and whatever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was you know but then more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think them in jail in fact is very interesting I think it's compelling um I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples um I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this it you can't do a perfect translation\nInto English from Hebrew in Greek ... from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek it's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns and people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a permanent and putting a person's name id but others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nUm and so we have to quibble inform the thing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's the way to beat it up and I hope not politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who is in Tulsa and the time we have left on coast to coast am Marty\nAnd the sort of a pleasure I'm honored uh first I've ever tried to call in the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I had to hit three eight hour by about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on\nA leading right [noise] I had\nA and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in awhile I bought you uh had disappeared forever\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nWell they needed year hey I'm In discussing a with a couple a gentleman earlier about the Bible\nYeah about thirty minutes ago or so you had talked about how Jesus I'm as depicted as being murdered and the ... but not in the Bible and I think I'm a seminary student I'm a minister I studied in a couple of different Bible college's and uh\nIt says very clearly and scripture that she says I'm no one could take his life he said that he laid it down we're fully he laid down voluntarily I
