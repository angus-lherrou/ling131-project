America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian\nThe Russian Federation under a populist opted authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing use nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four let's see what shall we do\nI thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes because he was absolutely nothing going on right [laughter] I actually remember slow new gate news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nWhen was the last time we had a slow news day open lines in the last\nHalf hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of Saudi journalist ... there are migrants on the march from Honduras there is the mid term elections in on the horizon we could talk about all that stuff but but\nLet me just throw this log on the fire and I think it's the single most important question out there\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the main through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting\nYou know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent I'm a very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of sound\nA nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a\nDefense system weapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate\nA the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa the not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact potent said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve us\nRussian ties you know when they met together and Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern\nBut one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons\nThroughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower\nUh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like well he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it but at the same time he does want stability he does want to end the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war\nStrategy or terrorists uh against China\nThis trade war strategy or terrorists or against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this an attempt to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't\nAchieve military supremacy over the United states\nMore clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world\nThere is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ... you know there are what six and a half percent growth\nIn the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters uh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is national security\nWe can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans did manage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other\nUh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming um the bed may is is driven by ideology in any way are are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedge them any\nWell as a combination of things I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy is it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and\nBringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint or the west is\nWhat Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and and the things that\nYou know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he's authoritarian\nHe still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russians constitutional court who\nEven started to you know hit at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march [noise] you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at\nPolitical corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there's a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen\nIndicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in there to fence ministers just met you for taking time over the top\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick up on the other side of the lines of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis here is Timmy Hendricks taking us into the break with blue do child on coast to coast am\n\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar search free would sign up there's a whole\nTitle luck dot com home title luck dot com\nWell thirty AM and you're listening to go to go\n\n[noise]\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived who\nDo you perceive as the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia and given\nTheir provocations but also a their military capability which they're not shy to exercise and around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations I'm rich and\nYou know have said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and\nA ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and\nJustifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenties sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty eighth team it terms we arrested\nA someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that I gave him if there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as\nA way of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know they'll say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there\nI I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO or and they\nOf course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nUh we got there the the mere threat in the long term threat and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed\nOut earlier with the defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nTwenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts served indicators demonstrate that these two nations are\nPushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening\nOr certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over in stone yeah\nThat's a that's why Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more\nAnd yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries you know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one a declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were\nThe war now there's only been one a declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in crime on next week you know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nYou know had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even pollen which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what\nThey did with Ukraine these are all issues of great a\nMagnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador\nAnd the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in the mid mid term elections\nUh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know the a defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are acts you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect that the Chinese have\nAnd somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn on and trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nUh activities building the equipment that through\nSecond and third level a contributors to a a large end item end up\nIn the U.S military and that's why I think

and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically in that part of the world\nOr otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with and given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who teased and others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um [noise] I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of course as we see is what I call the\nAlliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies\nIn China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just a North Korean some Iranians but others\nI think are a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you'd do a better what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in their country's best interest to\nNot have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that I'm Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd ah you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or\nYou know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that you know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas\nAbout the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint\nSo if I were both ... and I I'm pretty you know I I I've talked to John Bolton before and so I ... I kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's a\nThat's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want\nA ... of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs [noise]\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nOr is there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there\nIf Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades how would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria\nIs it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you know for me to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of then I I think that you find that they're not involved with the ... are not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia\nRiyadh and tear on it's going to continue\nUm but it it if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as Hezbollah in southern Lebanon\nAnd you know encouraging Hamas and you know Palestine and so forth and you know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and\nThey have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effect Sen in Saudi Arabia as well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\n...\n...\n...\nSeven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year and another seven hundred and coming up this year\nA it is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know you know how can the Russians and the Chinese be such an adversary and\nCompetitive with us while they hide most of what you're spending on their own national security you know the answer is we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to\nAll parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this seat quest ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight to replace you know with\nYour new aircraft for these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships you know it's an incredibly expensive to have an armed forces\nAnd you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was obviously a few years ago and basically he says that if you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have\nA modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested\nA seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new one alliance\nAnd so if we sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics in artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting this on a write glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast thing yeah\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the Chinese tapping our electronics for information on what I'm really concerned about\nIs what if the Chinese have programmed an end date into all of these electronic chips so that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nGreat question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics uh you know expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern\nA and that's something that I think that the Jim Mattis our defense secretary is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated\nElectronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there was a wake up call across a certainly the U.S military\nAnd I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of what the us spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm just I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of\nBeing hacked into somehow you know well\nYou know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground of cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that\nThere's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles\nI think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWhile hardline Don is intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nHave to remind me of ... and Daniel eight where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that ah that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was against\nYou know our key allies and against our interest in those five at the claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole faced years of all not touch the ground\nAnd they will destroy the ram that has the two wars of the the ladder horn is the bigger that comes up less than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last torn comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one\nWill help it says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nA pack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with that we're actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia ah so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a Congress but he did not use a\nAlso uh I Know Alexander the great a Congress but he did not use or anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as being a law explained in you know this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her\nOr has the wing hoping eagle and those wings will be blocked in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecy saying there are\nA summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob Let's say you\nKnow all I I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its it's used elsewhere even in revelation or the\nPossibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know of shy away from a piece of Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in\nTerms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy\nI'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read this suggests that they

drone three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he wanted to be the the championship game against Oklahoma for three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo\nShowed up he had drawn three sixteen in passing pre sixteen yards thirty one point six average per catch even CBS carry the game the rating for the game was thirty one point six percent\nWas the highest rating again go for the game because I remember right now as\nThe worst time of position thirty one minutes and seconds the only interception was there down at sixteen and ... burger through the interception of people that a white horse of the top of the stadium and the one in the ... mile high to the bronco de Jesus when you see it as a thing in the stadium you see this guy in the clouds above it with a white horse will Jesus returns and the Lakers with clouds so it has a symbol red revelation\nOf Jesus return runaway horse from revelation the opening kickoff in America opening kick off because it couldn't happen but I won't tell you that 'cause they'll take too long but anyway go ahead and I I Want I Want to get those facts out to you before\nMy phone cut off [laughter] it's ... it's remarkable and I I remember some of that not all of the details now is he not in the New York Mets a farm system ... he's in baseball now like I mean\nYeah you know what's really interesting and baseball to this really fascinating but I mean the other is kind of like a few when you see the halo you know to have you know there's a symbol and Jesus is coming back you know that there's no doubt that the oldest coincidences we're not a coincidence that there are too many even the opening kick off at the crossbar in a back at the end zone which is located tenure to sleep in the end zone rickety back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put us up on the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch back there is no way that could happen it ever happening again anywhere near that but it happened the beginning of that and nobody knew was gonna be a blessed game until\nI Want to go to one in touch them or one plant over time the marriage Thomas cut the eighty or passing over time just one player was over in the overtime he's more on Christmas twelve twenty five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the game getting people to three hundred and sixteen\nYears ago they get into baseball\nAnd yes he is and and he uh sort of continuing on and that in that realm he was on the pitchers man I Believe one game and he saw someone struggling ... in the in the stands\nI'm not sure whether they were having grass and he was getting ready to sign autographs right any kind of had\nEpilepsy feet or something\nA while he I thought he may be resuscitated this individual but he well he he would have\nBeen over and pray for him and the guy all of a sudden came back he got his breath and and he was choking and couldn't get his breath he was going to pass out and maybe die I don't know but he he bent over touched the guy's leg and then my did a prayer\nAnd um people were standing around that lady couple of ladies standing around one of them are we thought that she had with winter on tweet or somewhere where he you know one of those tax that she thought she had maybe witness the miracle or because the guy was a you know two paramedics or something there and they couldn't get either be\nAble to breathe he's an incredible individual and credibility thing I'll\nTell you one more thing is really interesting he he he when he played for the Mets have paid for the Mets minor league team when he played the river dogs who are to New York Yankee team back by sheer around the in the gym he played the team and and they mocked him every every place they go up to bat the plague hallelujah chorus music\nThey show him on the scoreboard crying when he cried when he lost the Alabama in the in the playoff game I guess\nAnd he also the issue of the river dogs people will remember do with the black patches and the guy jumping over him you know marketing John three sixteen the bottle but what happened later in that year people last like two or three of those games I Believe\nBut later in the year when the big thing was when they were winning three games to two or whatever all of a sudden they lost the third game in the fourth game and the Astros win it instead of them and so God remembers you though\nThat was more and more and more important\nThan the other thing with people on the minor league team with the river dogs that was the major league team didn't get in and they didn't get it and then she or either so maybe there is a little thing going on there with you know say hey you mark the three countries
