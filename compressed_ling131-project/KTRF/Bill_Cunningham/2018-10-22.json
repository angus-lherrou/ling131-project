well you know it's\nIt's kinda like it because if you live in Chicago yeah 'cause I live in Chicago and all you hear about from people that a lot of other places they do they talk about Al Capone of violence but it's like any section you know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure there's a lot of civilian areas however [noise]\nPart of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant or food is Fifteen Percent sales tax on food and if you order like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent

announced the guy is the government democratically elected one isn't\n[noise] well this last election there was a big uh uh this name as his initials or a jail wage because he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years [laughter]\nAnd then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get the legislature to make a two terms and people just liked it and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed on uh they're they're called the ... they're called cloud is what they did is they closed all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended\nFlights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that [noise] and and what they did this last time he'll they have these these like toll booth leaving the city there's three ... three major toll booths and they they just burn them out they just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths are no longer collecting tolls\nAnd that's a that's a major hit [noise] you know and and that's that's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days\nAnd you could hear the gunfire in the background 'cause San Pedro was like in a huge valley surrounded by mountains\nAre generally you what's the what's the life for the average Honduran what's it like\nWell if you have money you do well if you're poor or you don't want to be there because there's no public assistance\nTo the public hospitals are Laden with cockroaches [noise] but you know there's a lot of beautiful restaurants there the food is wonderful you know

daughters with her they're teenagers now and I'm Still good with my my inlaws and thinks\nIt's nice but you know you gotta be careful you don't want to do a bad business deal with anybody because of the good chance we could get hurt\nOkay now now you said you're against Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and Nicaragua is coming to America why are you against it\nWell it doesn't serve a purpose you know the same energy they see a lot of this is being ... funded by these left us you know George Soros types and and you know they should spend the same energy and resource to try to fix what's wrong in their own\nGovernment saying the stand your dream fix your own country what he said why leaving the best in the brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it's really in the long term mental is that's what\nHappens a lot of people with means a lot of Hondurans they should have gone to Spain and a lot of them\nCome illegally here you know in fact I hate to say it's one of my good friends actually got killed about five years ago he was involved in a bad car deal the transaction [noise] and he got off a pay cut killed right before Christmas\nSo you don't go there and you get a gun and kill somebody\nYeah and his brother actually had a tourist season he left his you know he's a ... the California for the last five years he ...\nHe gotta you're going to get married is going to try to get a paper view that these are the marriage so a lot of people with resources have left [noise] and come over here and then try to stay here you know by getting married he was doing something else to become legal\nRight it's it's a big problem he also down there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for a for electricity it's all diesel powered a generation it's not efficient is expensive and they keep raising the price of energy [laughter]\nYou know my water bills going up you know like fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and it's getting worse it's\nNot nothing but it could be a better manage just put it that way\nWell who's doing the managing it is in a military democratically elected it doesn't matter in Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes you know\nBut that's all kind of died down now but the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you can be tied into dollars so to speak you know things keep getting out of sight it's just like Venezuela no Venezuela\nBut it's the whole thing with inflation and try to keep up with stuff\nAnd yeah it's not always there's about a thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how
