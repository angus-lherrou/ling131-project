maddening no due process rights in fact Blumenthal and others who was the attorney general the Vietnam War hero\n... talked about the fact that a judge Kavanaugh setting United States court of appeals judge does not have the presumption of innocence\nDoesn't have it at all in fact once the allegation is made that is tantamount to conviction even Michael ... Scott mentioned Julie sweat and they had to take them as completely accurate and having asked for a one week delay\nThen when the FBI supplement it first seven time Mitch report they found that the nine witnesses interviewed by the FBI over the last five or six days and do so Thursday night we're kind of not not enough to add another list to twenty five more and was they were interviewed there'd be forty more and after that for a hundred more it would never stop\n'cause this is all about running out the clock taking about control descended on November the six that's what it's all about\nIt's not about fairness or determining whether or not you know Cavanaugh is a Romney slash Bush Republican he's not an Amy Coney Coney Barrett or a judge to park\nI have a sense that cabin always going to be a conservative\nMaybe about along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy because that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock\nRunning over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure but once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated a bone and by the Senate Mother Nature media\nI got on his side completely one hundred percent and the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore nor teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done\nNot because there is truthful information or corroborate information in fact it was shown to be false it's because the allegations the title nine proceedings\nBut that were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the fact you put a second front door in our house including the fact that uh\nThere were four witnesses that would corroborate her story including our best girlfriend none of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out in an affidavit to the Senate how\nMany times that professor Ford lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times\nAnd the major media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett\nA judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this or a judge the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen a container and their cause real cause some

twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens\nAnd made Nineteen eighties she had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely\nSuddenly there was one boy and not for\nSuddenly it was in her late teens it was Fifteen suddenly one in the mid Nineteen eighties it was Nineteen eighty two she had to change your story in order to fit Brad Kevin all that clearly indicated to me that she was mistaken at a minimum and probably line\nLet's continue with Brian from Indianapolis Brian in Annapolis welcome to the bill Cunningham show Brian go have\nA really good evening how are you\nA great day to being an American\nYesterday's yesterday's say listen I got I got several liars in the fire and if you fair with me I'll get them all out here man and you and we'll we'll ask them all out the first thing I I you know I listen to Susan Collins speak that she gay wonderful is excellent and and it was very truthful\nOkay Number two\nMy sis my little sister is a victim of a sexual assault that would have turned into a rape they've not been here for her boyfriend that that showed up and this was back in Nineteen eighty one okay never and I had some disagreements when when the doctor was hit her testimony in front of the committee\nAfter the fact took all come out the FBI investigation even my little sister who told me you know why don't you believe what she is saying I think I Believe for her but she has a lot inconsistencies\nAnd after all of this she has come to the conclusion also that she had a lot of inconsistencies and he got the bully she believes something happened to her but you don't believe it happened when Brett Kavanaugh was he\nWas running all what happened to her was a therapist knows for boys tried to re first she was in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties that happened and that doesn't fit Brad Kevin all but she projected his face on those four boys goes to fit or a political opinions\nBut I Do market across team was it is\nYeah lacrosse team they re boys in\nBoise got accused of rape yeah OK and now getting out here shipping hears again not Brett Kavanaugh he's ... he he's right he is down in the middle a moderate conservative if you look at his decisions\nThat the constitution is not a my opinion is not a living breathing document it is written Jimmy interpreted as it is written and that's the only way that our constitutional republic will survive\nWe cannot change the parameters or move the Gulf posed as the Democrats do\nAh on this and I believe Brett Kavanaugh will roll roll as the constitution dictates the ... guy Kim\nBrand can I tell you fired a conversation and had dinner with Antonin Scalia or ... I remember you talking about here years ago and he said look it comes down to two words which is who decides he said we have a brilliant foundational documents that provide certain rights immunities\nEt cetera et cetera if anything else happens with space travel and cancer and the death penalty and the guillotine in other words the Congress decides all these other issues he said to me many times I Would I Would find constitutional law that I Would never passed but it's not my role as a Supreme Court justice\nTo supplant the will of the people he said you do your fellow citizens to go out there and convince others as to their worthiness of what you're saying pass a law and if it does in conflicts with the U.S constitution that is the law the land was he the Democrats don't want to do that they want to short circuit\nThe democracy their constitutional republic or in and they want to go to the court system to impose on us laws that they can't get otherwise past that's the problem\nAnd here's this is my next point this is my next point they want to expand we don't we cannot live we cannot have everybody in the world come and live in the United states of America is physically impossible [noise] we don't have we don't we don't have enough fight we don't have enough\nSpace congestion salt so\nSo the constitution of course the founding fathers didn't realize how big our nation will become but the constitution has set parameters that the Democrats want to adjust and expand now with with the appointment of cabin all\nPresident Trump keeping its promises they're going to resort to violence and the mid term elections you watch they're gonna raise or I'm not I'm surprised that nobody has been even worse than what it\nHas no Brian taken what you're saying even lease they've already resorted to violence look what they did a brunch kilometer Fox and friends look what they did to Jeff Flake ... they're they're shooting the Democrats are shooting Republicans and like it was a one day story and then ignored\nExactly and I and I appreciate you guys giving me this time and I got one one more\nPoint in your head because\nNow we ... the the the endgame bellicose veep Angelica vote is going to be very important in terms that you know these people have called me so many names now the ...
