keep them in line with continued thirty minutes after they are do cutting undergrad American live with you [noise] every something [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nHow many jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we talking about a million\nWas you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff\nTo make a big deal if they have three hundred actually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country to the European Union has been\nBrutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed just to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in the audience and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a piece of grain okay if we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately after the plane and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the we've\nGot all the way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've don't Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the\nYou got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nHis show right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President Xi but instead we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent\nSo we're taking billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so\nChina has been look China is the biggest ... by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade with everybody those days are over bill\nNow Wesley wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls below sea takes the house Schumer Texas Senate your life becomes miserable the last two years what\nDo you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what we don't want Bedford Falls the way it looks we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say they met terms for lack of take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it ...\nYou have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to vote one percent Rasmussen fit and we know we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it because when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what I mean it's a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice cabin on fifteenth judge out however that fifty new judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice cabin or because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the men are great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law banana consequences because since I've had many women were spurred my air bell I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican face when otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate that you've been a very terrific guy and so you're also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk relatives Russian about uh that's not too many and Sean is you know so it was great but these are great people great talents\nAnd I appreciate it do we have to do well uh I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we can pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls\nIf you look three weeks ago and you look now it's like especially ... when she was ... points down now she has four or five points up Marcia from Tennessee that ... ... almost all of them now I don't know how you doing here I Know it's a tough race but uh it's unfortunate because he's such a good\nMan I mean I don't know Sherrod Brown says socialist but you know he has a lot of Trump voters are voting for sure he's going around in a lot of people think he's my best friend in the world the ads are like Trump pads he talks about you know it's amazing except there's only during this period of time at six weeks\nAfter it's over so it's one of those things but\nI Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well for ... when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for them\nBut I just want to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that this is a very important election Mitt terms I think frankly I think people are viewing this as very important you know usually midterms are like sleepers yeah people they they are energized and for those that say that the\nThat the blue is energized bringing the Democrats and we're not ... I think personally I think we're more energized\nSuzie Lebanon they lined up yesterday morning us yeah there's twenty thousand trying to get into two thousand yeah it it's a problem with the size of the right way to see what happens if you're not going to believe the energy\nBut we had it in Erie, Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand arena it's been amazing and if that kind of you know action shows up in three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three\nWe got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis a law and that might think sixty eight yeah I Know you get older I got three more waking up to three weeks and while I have\nTwenty five days and twenty five days I'm Out campaigning for many of those days I Do all of them but you can only move this big equipment so often rock hey and Secret Service and all of that\nBut we're very very busy and we're going to the races that are close or slightly ahead or slightly behind and we'll make it a lot of shops and just one we're doing for TV should when he'll he's really good and he should win but uh\nI Will be very upset if he tested but I think it's going\nTo as the president it you're the best you're a great American idol they're that all the ... but you're a great America keep doing what you're doing for the voices you don't hear in the face as you don't see you're going to see a few and have an hour or so but those people you're the hero I was with Reagan eighty four when he came here I thought Reagan was a star\nHe was the Rolling Stones you're the Beatles ... you're on the television show I'm Serious about this\nWhat I really do appreciate your support for such an important voice and you've been with us and uh\nYou know just say hello to all you need to put a lot of oh you're a great\nAmerica thank you thank you very much but thank you\nContinue with more built counting the great American live with you every Sunday night\n[noise]\nListening counting on twelve learning the river [noise]\n\nHey guys can hear from the hip typecast today's growth who would win at three mile bicycle racing eleven year old girl or last year's winner the Tour de France it all depends on the bicycle it depends on their vehicle\nBoth on a ten speed in the ... going to win every time but put the race around the trade circle and the eleven year old when every time you see it's not the driver it's the vehicle when it comes to generating revenue it's exactly the same if you have a job or a small business you are writing a trace of all you can only go so fast\nIf you need to make up ... it's not going to happen on a tray sickle no matter how fast you pedal it's simply not going to win the race\nWhy do many people with no schooling and no advanced degree often become very wealthy simple they choose to only right ten speed when it comes to helping people create their next revenue model both Forbes any recommend income store as a can't miss when it comes to putting people in it tends to be could your household or business using additional revenue model that doesn't solely depend on you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "15"}
