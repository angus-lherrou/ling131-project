diamond and so I Can't believe it's the woman's got to figure it out well why can't more blacks figure out what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nTo say I don't know and that's what I wanted this lady again oh why in the walls all this stuff though so I called it all the time and the other being held it's sad to free slaves not want that voted to free the slaves that Republicans are either\nOne of the Democratic donors white and the Democrats owned slaves and the Republicans tried to free them\nAnd then after the war the Democrats allege blacks and the Republicans tried to save them and now here we are in twenty Eighteen the Democratic party has destroyed African Americans and the Republicans like John drunk Donald Trump or saving them but ... but the media doesn't cover that why do they\nKnow they don't and I'm very upset because July ... ... ... this year I went to visit or who has cable and I heard a report\nOn land an alien and or at a ... a woman in front of her Thirteen butter on dragged her in the woods and that and killed her\nAnd I would not report that on the news you\nKnow that was a blackout oh I Know how do we ... that are killing

the\nMouthpiece for the modern Democratic Party there is no grew more hurt by legal oily and migration into America that African Americans\nThey're the ones hurt most part and poor white folk poor white for workers now most poor people in America are white and poor white folks are heard by two and they tend to vote disproportionally for Democrats it's unbelievable\nNot their flight girl but anyway you know I hated Obama I'd still hate and he's wicket and evil will turn the turn of the third world country up that at all\nTarget in the third world country up there that we have never had a president in the country that I can recall that oh I don't I Will try the following president\nOr president say wow I Can't he thought\nWell you know Patsy uh some are concerned that Obama and Clinton are back out campaign you might recall\nThat Obama said my name's on the ballot this is my third term Hillary's going to continue my policies and there were so roundly unpopular that as soon as the American people living in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa Florida Texas\nHurt Obama's say vote for Hillary we've got four more years of my policy\nThat's what caused working class folks in these so called swing states to come out one hundred percent against Obama and against Hillary Clinton because as soon as they discovered you know what the Bible for Hillary I got four more years of Obama maniacs I Can't take it hell that's what Trump was elected\nAnd so of Hillary and or an Obama and Michelle whoever wants to go out and keep campaigning I go out there remind the American people

that they have job so that they can provide for their families and looking out for\nPeople that have been and justly wrong and looking out for people that's coming out of prison so that that can have a second chance the second opportunity at life president Donald Trump that bring these jobs\nBack here to American for Americans to work because the black president said those jobs will never come back and you have to be an individual to send jobs overseas and leave the American people over here broke and broken and no way for them to take and take care of their children\nI tell you what do when you look at what he said you might recall diamond\nBernanke Hussein Obama saying no jobs coming back man you can forget about it they're not coming up they just want because new trade deals with Canada trade deals with much you know the trade deals with South Korea the trade deals with Europe and the fact China's gonna fall under the Trump\nTrump page and the next job among those jobs back

the ship is up I'm an African American I mean some people want to thrive in this country\nAnd they are doing so not only that anthrax he also gave your tax cuts where you have more money in your pocket but I can look at the ... the Democrat Party back in the day they push the Jim Crow to suppress an old press today they try to push them to suppress it open and they think wait the American\nPeople are going to fall for it to the American people a man's\nBody that's going to wind up with the cars going to make sure that we live and we are able to look at the American dream and

okay with the Democrats than we gonna do this we're going to give your stability we gotta get get that they was in office for a year\nWe're going to get your stability we gotta get get that they would end up at four years and what did they do for the black community\nAbsolutely not I don't know the non\nMilitary up this way if people do not know their history they're condemned to repeat it\nBack to

said we must be on civil to Republican leadership for the modern Democratic Party Cory Booker Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton incentivizing encourage violence\nAgainst Republicans based upon their
