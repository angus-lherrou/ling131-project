'em real liberal TV and radio at like KPFK coming out a boss Angeles\nOr we have a in Grand Rapids back here we have a black I Am radio talk show and sometimes I Can't listen to that because they just they're very respectful of the president I mean I didn't\nVote for Obama that I Would never talk about no I wouldn't be respectful of the office of the president [laughter]\n... really good things from day I'm like I was listening to the black [noise] talk show host and he was talking about are Supreme Court here in Michigan and he was telling us to all the liberal Democrats were running for judges in Michigan or\nDo I usually don't vote project is because I don't know them that well but when he named the liberal judges that they wanted on the Supreme Court here in New York and nice\nOkay those are the ones I Will not vote for\nThose are the ones that said I'm not going that way it's picture in Michigan the disturbance now is there a chance you might lose she she's such a clown is there I Know Debbie Stabenow is there a judge you might lose [noise]\nI don't think so she just I don't know she's telling us that we're in the you know they should get a guy to kind of half West Michigan is\nThrough it in eastern Michigan\nIs very you know a week that I'm not ... population we got a large black population we got a large democratic population over there\nAnd that's where she's out of the chances are slim [noise] you know and I called up her office and said you know have you ever read the Koran and they don't have an answer you and he asked her a letter back from her\nI Can't imagine a worst representative and Debbie Stabenow and she's running against a a black Republican is going to get a lot of African American vote or not\nBut I Hope so although I did not vote for him because there were some things about him getting\nUm money to certain people that I didn't kind of agree with that because he was backed by Trump he got elected so um [noise]\nDo you know we have a Muslim lady hit back here that's running on a polish for Senate because she's from Detroit and it's largely Muslim now [noise] so um there's areas of Michigan like in Minnesota where [noise]\nUm we don't have any choice people are not even running against or\nIt's unbelievable isn't it\n[noise] and you know we got a proposal on our ballot which is really interesting um [noise] because you know they're they're trying to get away\nGet away with redistricting thing because they think it's a very so they've Republicans at that moment [laughter] so we go next to the proposal on the ballot now where they want to go to just Thirteen people that will be picked by the secretary of state randomly\nLike random will be you know depending on whether the secretary of state is a Democrat or Republican [noise] and they're going to pick like Thirteen people for decided Republican and for decided Democrat\nRenters just look at John James I think John James has a shot at winning that seat it

Fong lost his law law license the prosecutor and went to jail but there was an remembered Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton raising money making sure the so called a rape victim ed free college tuition\nAnd now she's having prison time for like murder but but but nonetheless there was no level of apologies\nFrom ABC NBC CBS the New York times CNN MSNBC and they simply moved on to the next ... next carnival never offering some fishing apologies\nThat is three boys who was brutally wrongfully accused somebody ... it was a joke what happened to them and the ... boys or what happened to UBA in Rolling Stone all of these hoaxes take place\nIn the media just moves on to the next circus\nIt exactly people were actually disappointed that that woman had not been raped and now I'm sure probably most Democrats are very disappointed when it really occurred to them if they're honest with themselves that\nReally wrecked Kavanaugh had not assaulted\nHer not ... not ... it was proven ugly falls based upon their research done\nA professor for to answer she testified every factual statement she made was uncorroborated or refuted not one thing whether it was the door whether it was the air travel was it the timing was it the event itself whether her age none of it it's\nNone of it fit facts but that didn't keep the media ... continuing to slime in\n... they they practically and the point I Would make is a shame on anybody who was disappointed that this one was not sexually assault\nThey wanted her to be sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh they wanted to be true did and they\nThat's right they were hoping hoping against hope that she had been sexually assaulted and they hope that because it advance their liberal narrative just as in the Duke lacrosse case they were disappointed that woman had not been rate they were disappointed\nAnd remember the a writer named aerial do moss further Steven Kobe or Late Show on CBS today she tweeted quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote facts that mentality\nExactly that's where they're coming from and and shame on anybody and everybody who feels that way I Would ever my narrative it is is I Do I Will never be happy that someone else suckered in order for me\nTo advance by narratives well the letter was happy that Brett Kavanaugh as his wife and children his mom and dad they're happy that he went through so much pain they have joy from the sorrow he's feeling on these false charges that makes a Stephen King Barrett types to be quite happy\nExactly and shame on all of them and we've got to teach them a lesson in about three or four\nHome we got to sweep these people out of office I don't care what\nWe got about ... vote you got to vote normal people go to vote Joe you're on marriage\nThank you\nThank you thank you Joe we got her on thank you and by the way the Houston Texans are about to kick the game winning feel go to beat up on the Dallas Cowboys Nineteen sixteen a short feel go we'll see what happens let's continue was more forty six minutes after the are built Cunningham the great American live with you every Sunday night\n[noise]\nBuild Cunningham show on the [noise]\nAre you\nPutting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.
