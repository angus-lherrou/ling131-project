Corey Lewandowski urine about five minutes see was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for like a year and a half\nAnd I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight looks to me like all hell breaks loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks in two days to bring down the Republicans in the Congress and I say all contrary mon forever I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges here's performed magnificently and all three areas\nAnd I think this is the October surprise that will think the Democratic party come or the next sixteen days let's continue with more blood becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up in about five minutes or recording Lewandowski top of the next our way of Kevin ... near the blacks we're\nTo talk about why he was like oh by Fox and the impact in the black community of illegal immigration good at the bottom of the last hour we're going to have on a report and Peter Wallison who's written a book about the deep state the fourth branch of\nGovernment which is the bureaucracy so continuous more Cunningham the great American\nWhy would you ever been in\nAnd they asked her do you think that relationship was inappropriate\nAnd less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult\nHe was the president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband behavior can you imagine for one second and that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with older and the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse drawing away and I'm sure the media would say well she's an adult no big deal I mean the doubles\nOr the media would say well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nHas always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett those Ninety two percent of the media coverage of this president's\nNegative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent I Would expect that but we're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again\nFor the first time in ten years and there is no credit for what the president's done let alone the twenty Americans who've been held hostage in other countries that he got return not one plane loads of cash to our palette loads of money but on his own share when we do to get these people back\nYou know you saw a ... the pastor come back just a week or so ago and\nThat was a it was a blip on the radar screen the president has gotten twenty Americans either in North Korea or an Egypt or wherever they have been home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media Brock Obama would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's\nAt least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico and the mainstream media hate\nThis kind of an issue percolating\nA little over two would come from the election because it reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected was to curtail illegal migration from Central America and Mexico into our country\nThere's a I like Google this information there is a hundred and fifty million Mexicans watermelons Hondurans in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million don't like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela and Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide Paraguay I were talking to a hundred and fifty million\nA central and South American would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration they talk about refugee status they talk about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers\nHowever uh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one night I'm watching sixty minutes and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border hundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed\nBecause they will become drug meals and that when these individuals paying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars to transport them from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and Mexico into America when this is funding and fueling MS Thirteen dry\nTo make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they pass through in Mexico has the drug war ... somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay their body and sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raped on the way from Central America\nTo to the United states and when it's report it which is not done by the mainstream media that this has been extremely dangerous route that men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred miles\nAnd then when they get a new American ... they're they're not released many times you go work in a brothel and off an Austin you go to Baton Rouge and working abroad or if you're a man you sent you stand on street corners to sell drugs\nWhich is paying back your transit seat there there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality of what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for drum\nOf the reality of what happens to the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happens to them it's still just pick up all the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this why does the media cover it objectively\nThe media doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who are coming to this country the porn impoverished that are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only did they two hundred and fifty million people from South and Central America want to come here people from all over the world want to come here but we're not a country if we can't control our borders or\nDon't Reagan said it you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world than the greatest privilege we can give somebody is to make them a citizen\nAnd there was a way to do that but just coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important what takes place with these people and they make this track from Honduras through Mexico and ultimately up to the U.S border is\nA disgusting display of gangs that take advantage of these people they raped women they kill them and and you're exactly right even\nIf they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally\nAnd those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make sure that it doesn't continue the best way to do that is you build a wall on the southern border\nAnd you say if you make it to the United states you know not make it into our country and they were they process to come here and you want to follow the process we're a nation of laws and what we will do as a Republican Party has to make sure that the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\nHave all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally\nUnlike the Democrats who want to be fun and diligent them eyes the men and women who serve an ice everyday that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCorey Lewandowski wide or the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law\nUntil ten or so\nUnited States senators who are Democrats agree to the change would you build a wall\nBrings insanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are you know we have a big wall with lots of doors in it\nAnd every legitimate person that wants to come here to to work whatever ought to be able to do it but the the the byproduct of that would it be do a lemonade drug a heroin and math in Cincinnati in Austin in Tampa in Milwaukee\nBy by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not one controller southern border\nBecause they love the political issue and they don't want to resolve the issue and look this president went out and say you give me the money for the wall and all the people that are here through no fault of their own what's arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own\nI Will give them the president said a pathway to citizenship and that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you there was a lot of consternation when he made that statement\nBut he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they've wanted for a long time\nAnd they said no we're not going to get that too and they want to have the political football they want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border illegally and going to sanctuary cities and centuries states have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens\nAnd asking them to go and vote and they they are\n... bought and sold by the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation is to the people in this country to make sure they're safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come\nAnd we absolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis\nBut you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there is either a vacation when your job is done you go back to your country that how it works that that was always work and we just need to know a better job of forcing that\nCorey Lewandowski lastly there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton is making a run and twenty twenty\nYou know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage\nHer to run I Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty would you do a great job\nOh we we would love this look in the right to vote for two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's re election effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred\nAnd what he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember is with it and when they woke up ... twenty sixteen the New York times and all of those mainstream media outlets said it will require that Ninety nine percent\nChance of winning today we're going to get to ... percent of the only two people on the ballot so I Want her to run I run we want to\nGo back through all of her email scandal all of the money that she's gotten from foreign governments when she was a secretary of state in the Clinton Foundation and all the fact that she's lost her security clearance let's go re litigated all what's quarterback and for the
