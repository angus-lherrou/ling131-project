monitors and so that's where I look to probably in what you're listening to All right so look ... monitors that's probably what to wear your problem ...\nAll right well I'm I'm guessing I'm On the air I don't ah here's a USO but I'll I'll guess I'm On the air you're on there [noise]\nOkay I ever got a ... well I'll tell you that is a at both these teams coming into tonight's a action this evening a knowing that the last ... regular season game as they get ready for a for playoffs and really it was kind of a final tune up\nFor these two teams are knowing that the no matter what happened to that I really probably wouldn't change where they would be seated now poll or section eight eight they said tomorrow and it looks as of right now that a red light Comedy Central most days there on the east side\nThey are and right now the forest spots and it does look like they'll probably end up in the force by that gets Boston won\nA and then there is a lake of the woods and then ... and then number four regret like county ... looks like they will stay there it didn't matter what happens if they would stay at the force by\nAnd what that would mean is they don't have to play the playing game on Mondays being for the first time in many years now they don't play that first round they will go right to Thursday and they will get as the number four seat if it indeed stays that way\nAs a force feed your host the five seed what's right now it looks like it's probably going to be hosting when a Mac next Thursday night so tomorrow will be filed they'll they'll have decisions tomorrow so we'll know tomorrow but it doesn't look like mustangs ah we'll probably have a home playoff game next Thursday night or the like like what am\nTonight they be won over the last three games to none but it wasn't as easy as three games to not they were three matches or three ... there were a whole host in this match tonight in fact\nThe lawyers really got role and they got rolling early they took a big lead they ended up winning sent three twenty five Thirteen so they've got the problem is really a little bit except that in that third set the warriors lost their best player\nCaitlin ... or ...\nOr by far the best hitter for the world and lawyers and whenever they needed a big point tonight that's for the when she didn't want every team mates got tied up on a scramble for all\nBy that three quarters of the way through that third said they went down and eat to the floor Caitlin bounce teary eyed a boat monster or head off to the gym floor\nI watched it when they got their feet and she was noticeably ... at that point people were balls used their second time out to try and write the ship a little bit it was like twenty to Thirteen at the time\nAnd a\nWrite in that range anyway and got lost the game over the bench and sat down teen idol she talked to one of the assistance when it was decided\nThat she was done at least for the remainder of this at\nThat point a couple of other players that Madison fish among them took over for the lawyers and they won the third set twenty five thirty eight to one and we go to the for the\nLast ... not come off the bench to start to pour that people were all put their foot on the gas they jumped out six to one\nAnd then they open it up even bigger it was like twelve to four\n\nAnd when he got to be I bought the team to eat or nine right in that range I coach Brecht in Boulder plastic gun out of the ... and put a lot of feedback yeah\nNow she was noticeably skill unsteady\nI don't I Will say she has a good thing because I'm not a doctor I don't try to play one on radio\nBut\nShe did not have the same energy she had early in the end the match and I just did not he got a couple of gills made a couple of points bowls that before she was early\nAnd it probably just kept the pressure on and they won the third the worst thing going away\nThe wins by three steps to one margin and claimed victory this evening like I said that women give the Palestinians their regular season\nBut it gives the others they should anyway when the seats come out a home floor advantage in the first round of the playoffs with your next week Thursday now the seeds aren't done until Sunday in a two way because there are teams still playing on Saturday and a couple of tournaments better laugh\nI Know a world goes down to a tournament burgers fall\nBut people were calling the has done and they're done in a big way with a big win that should get them home for advantage in the first round of the playoffs fathers also keep docked in a normal starter\nGenerics him did not even drafted CDC pulled a muscle in her leg sometime this past week and they held her out tonight\nAnd went with Katie Nelson in the first couple of cents then in the fourth set they want without heavy weight in that spot and the combination was enough to help the ... to victory this evening big night for the fall I highly offered to you they just by wanting to kill Mr double double\n... guilt and service point a Matty get should end up back to where where did you get the net on blocks and blocks kills a big service night also brandy rose and do as a fever of ... got to go on early and often this evening and when I have three seven to one margin to take to victory in er in home for advantage to postseason\nOkay when as we get ratings in the post season now using [noise]\nSure insurance ... a a home loan match coming up next week next Thursday I look at the standing there is a north than from the south how do they run the playoffs\n... do you play with in the north have for I Believe it's the first two rounds venue cross brackets\nOkay All right so is there a chance at a scene from her falls would actually host ward wrote in the first round [noise]\nHi it's possible the one thing there though is the more ... cooks been ended up close on war road have the director there because they beat the pirates\nOkay All right I understand why\nThey did not cooks can be more roads that probably will probably be drugs that\nSmoking so we we play encouraged to\nThe world one tonight because they all would have beat each other more along the river falls trucks that would have eaten war wrote and people were falls would've beaten drugs to write and then the next tie breaker is\nBeginning percentage in the section and I think the ... what a drop all the way to six so this was a big win from that standpoint you went from being the only game in the first round did not have to play and not having to play ... in the first round\nYou know you look in the evening\nIf you look at the north has standing roses going again number one minute God you've got five or six teams uh there's hardly anybody and that's actually overall for five hundred in the whole uh nor the standings on the north side of the section doubling\nThat rule so it's a clear cut favorite they they have the best year of all the teams um but you know you look at the river falls they're winning record they're winning percentage of them very good but they've had a lot of really close match that they've lost three one and in one of those three sets they battled and took it the extra\nPoints or they've lost three to ... you know that type of thing so so they had opportunities big just not been able to finish them being able to finish tonight and not let world bounce back after winning ... percent were very big for the GOP\nOkay and the CD meaning is tomorrow [noise]\nNot offered to weigh it won't be till Sunday\nOkay so they wait until the end of the week so they must be other teams\nBe till Sunday okay so they wait until the end of the week so they must be other some still playing yeah Eric tournaments okay\nSo you gotta wait for that so we won't find out until probably one Sunday Monday [noise]\nYeah I won't be official official but everybody I talked to like documents beer Meyer today on the way up here just to clarify things and he's on the district committee for the bully and he told me that's the way he understood it okay to Providence won tonight they would be an on\nGoing well that's good news so\nI I unless we both totally don't understand that you are up which is\nWhy\nI that's the way we gotta figure right now is it probably will have a home game and the first round\nI dodged the same thing about mark Martin about the same thing with these two teams and he's on tonight for allergies and they had a lot of close matches that a lot of close to that [noise] are they going to be razor playoffs next week\n[noise] why they don't have any choice but to be right that time you you either you either put up or shut up at this time of year on and they you you either are ready to play\nOr you're not a lot of it for me I especially in the first round playoff games comes down to outback drew seniors want to play one more time and it probably does have an for seniors honesty\nRight so you know how bad do they want to play one last time\nThe uh the nine\nMartin Gallagher the are the heroes and dolls I\nThe other sees the back of the leaders on this team and so on and so forth but how how much how badly they want Matty Ice yet how bad they did they want to take one more time I've probably volleyball player you that and they asked if only they can make that decision nobody else can\nOkay we'll probably get a big victory tonight [noise]\nThat very big win for\nProbably the ... and you get anything on them\n[noise] she's fought in the squad last I Do not have spores okay\nIt was a very early night or roads tonight I walked in about twenty after five in the squad was done already\nThe GED game tended at about ten minutes after ... ... as if he falls on twenty five Nineteen twenty five five well\nAnd they held the or the varsity max about Fifteen minutes before they even started their pregame ceremony which included that Jack Reed college age students do other things\nBefore they actually started a twenty minute warm up to be getting closer to a normal start time but that's that's part of the reason we were done for you know we played for sex and we were done by thirty five forty nine\nAnd that's why I look at the scoreboard here nine guns on the air here and we have known scores are really starting to get them now but yeah you were done earlier none of money for the lions [noise]\nYou know and that was most game and everything yes\nI Am in fact right now I'm almost the badger [laughter] [noise]\nYou know the home early that's good though and and I'm not hammering it I'm driving on at the speed

back in time for our guest has written a spy and the trader introduced as if you would to Burton Gerber\n[noise] button was the head of the ... the section within the CIA a man of great intelligence and on and on sort of brilliant I'm kind of forensic approach to the child no no\nButton guy but it was the person who decided in Nineteen eighty one or two that\nThe CIA needed to know whether the information was coming from they need to know\nWho was the British spy that was producing this great\nAmount of material because the Brits were passing along this stuff\nTo the CIA but they would never say where it came from that kind of one of the conventions in in international kind of spy craft as you don't give away all souls and so and my six would never explained the CIA where it came from and button ... among others felt\nThat they need to find out they need to find out who it was that was producing inflation and so they began to trying to launch their own investigation into the identity of the British spy\nAs those in the book here I'll just quote\nAnd so with approval from above Gerber launched a discrete spy hot early Nineteen eighty five you instructed the CIA investigator to set about I'm covering the identity of the British super spy and my six our ally after all the British him I should\nKnow account discover what was going on Gerber did not see this as a betrayal of trust and still less was spying on an ally he believed it was more aid tying up of loose ends prudent and legitimate cross checking\nAll right so far so good and now we come to the person who became a key in this operation it's a name we've heard before who was that\nThat was old rich aims role models you know\nWell I mean this you know I mean it was new full of of button good but in fact the tricky aspect of his was that the heads of the country into section in the in the ... section was older change too was about\nTo go over to the KGB so you've got you got to really strange situation here where\nThe KGB spying effect today on the CIA or the CIA is trying to find out who at my six sizes that spy that my six he's spying on the KGB so what happened is that do the uh the older James\nOffered to buy for the KGB he went to the Soviet embassy in Washington DC in in may Nineteen eighty five an offer to give them everything he knew in return for money older James was one of those spies who really was basically didn't tiny by greed\nAmazing so you have here a double agent\nUh ostensibly Soviet been working for the west and his identity is now being investigated by an American a double agent ostensibly working for us but actually working soon to be working for the Soviets I mean that reads like the plot out of a novel\nWhat seems completely unlike the doesn't it

you don't want to miss any of the three hours stay tuned and let me bring my mayor ... what's happening man how you doing I'm\nDoing just great and I'm feeling good I got to get out to the ballpark to Dodger Stadium Chris [noise]\nAs much time in between uh last night's game no\nNot at all hours fits the day I felt good being out there with the other writers talking to some people before the game\nA so always every chance I can get\nObviously I got to get back to do the show right when I got a little you know pre game and that's when you get to talk to people and find out what's going on the debt and was able to watch the first inning before I came back to the studios here so it was a real good and you got to another good game was on the other barn burner and this is\nChris this is the game I made his game five must do the Dodgers yeah the winter because you're going back for two and a walkie\nI think the winner of this when the series I think it just about well obviously Milwaukee will still have a decent shot going they will live when he was a game but they certainly Dodgers have won in the Dodgers were white but the Dodgers split yeah there so it's not like they didn't win an automatic by not no not at all but uh yeah big show for us today\nSo much to do and now let's welcome in an odd couple of course we always do because you know what Chris we wouldn't be able to do this fine radio program without the we wouldn't know and\nDollars will come and Rob G A producer\nAlex or engineer or Ankara Deb Carson yes our intern Kyla we've got you and I'm a larger are always comes in every so often any ah take suits us for a a face not Facebook or\nYouTube periscope right you do all over owes us all over the place so every but they're all on the other side of the glass so you know what Chris Broussard let's kick some national news when\nOur right some days you say that better than others now some days you're saying with the rhythm that where it's like a rhyme other days you just say I just said [laughter] like I'm just letting you know what to do like it now I like that that show law that she'll call me cars are significant works good catch phrase now I Know\nPeople don't realize the other people on the other side of the glass in the radio and so we're in one room there and another\nAnd that's right and this Thomas Mapp let's do it has to do it well look you were out there Dodger Stadium you got to see Clayton curse on what was certainly a big\nA performance for him big day and he's gone six on is is that they have they relieved him yet but he's gone six innings gave it up one run as you said it's tied at one only three hits so nice out even by curse shot and he\nWas in a little trouble we had a second and third or and they got yellow ... out and I think Braun right uh yeah so so he wiggled out of it which could have been\nA big spot but so far you write in a big game he's got this team in the mix it's one one ah nobody was looking for him to pitch a no hitter Chris or or complete game shutout just the pitch a good day or many gives them in ... when it so that's what he's done\nWell the question is before the game you saw a lot of articles on this and you will see this anytime the Dodgers are in relative trouble or you know in the rest of the way if they get to the world series in throughout Everytime he takes the mound\nPeople are going to wonder is this the last time you see him in a Dodger uniform and can opt out after this year this could be\nHis last started Dodger Stadium yeah you know like today they were fans talking about it\nI was in the crowd you know walking around and people were like you think this is the you know asking and I was like they could be I mean sometimes you don't think about those things but when you add it all up say the Dodgers were to lose and then they go to Milwaukee and losing ... play again\nThen he could opt out and he wouldn't be done in Los Angeles\nHave you gotten any sense from whether it was some of the reporters who were talking to if you talk to anybody and the Dodgers organization or even from what fans may be thinking of you getting any sense\nFor the feeling of whether the Dodgers intend to bring him back I mean obviously they want him back at a at the right price but are they willing to break the bank 'cause I think he makes\nIs he going to be thirty five million that he would opt out of what it says coil does that he's going to obviously be looking for a huge payday so do you think the Dodgers are looking like hey no matter what it is we're bringing me back up\nI'm just telling you as how hard it is the get pitching and I get the frustration of courage show when it comes to the post season don't get me wrong your Dodger fan you're sick over the idea of Christ that you have\nOne of the greatest pictures of our generation white world Dodgers look for him no question that you didn't get a World Series the Dodgers have won six straight\nAnd was divisions okay there have been in position to to get there to win and it just hasn't happened last year they won seven games with the Astros and it didn't happen so the point really is\nDo you want to go back to the ... and it's been Thirty years since they've won a World Series but what do you want to go back to where you're not even in the mix\nWell that's the one they lose ... he wasn't there a best picture this year no not this year but in previous I of course previous years but you know you're looking forward is he going to be your age\nI'm going to give you the example that I'll give other people I mean that I've given other people everybody thought that are just in Berlin was finished dinner ... okay and what is the tigers do they move them\nTiger is it going this way Chris goes south and you're like going out and just in Berlin to help with the world series for the Astros and ...\nAnd he's huge now and he's here now in great\nSo it's always one of those things you know I still had an eighth can have a couple of murky years but it doesn't he's not old or anything like what he's done and you're like oh well he's forty years old you should get rid of now\nI think you got to be careful when you're talking about a guy when you put a guy that caliber out every fifth day Chris you always have a chance to win and you know what you also don't have you don't have eight and ten\nGame losing streak right because every time he goes out there you got a chance to win and that's how good teams are built that's really why good team because they don't lose eight in a row they don't lose ten in a row there's no way you're gonna beat him twice in two starts you know what I mean\nIn this day and age he so unique because we've seen great pictures\nYou know who who are great for three four years then and then whether it's injury a lot of guys we saying go to new places and they don't pan out big time for ages get paid you yell wherever you are Santana up his

Shaw\nYeah your thing I think that I think there's a chance that he could uh because like there are enough teams out there for desperate for them to the rotation starting pitching that they might not give her more than thirty two and a half million a year but they might go up there you're on the ...\nOr or or if you're on the deal and he might consider you know taking something like that so I guess is in the end the Dodgers curse all work something out whether that's adding to Europe or maybe keep it at a true you're but maybe you know a set it up a little bit for the two years where\nHe feels like it's getting a premium for the next year before he goes to create the so\nI I my guess is that that they'll make a deal before he gets to the opt out and then he adds up stand a Los Angeles\n... let me ask you a lot of people you know do they get frustrated with coach draws postseason a we know he's one of the best pictures of our generation that we've seen especially during the regular season and and see just till ... people how hard it is to get a guy\nAnd and see just so ... ... people how harder to get a guy like that\nAnd to give them up and the example I gave up was the the tigers finally gave up on Bert land or you know could you had a couple of down season then he turned it around got healthier and help the Astros win a World Series so isn't it hard to give up on on a guy like curse of cultural\nYeah I think I think it's you know where you are and the time and place in your ... your stations also the tires\nYou don't give up on earlier but they're going to rebuild so they figure you know what why why have 'em here are paying that money if if he's got to where those tapes that aren't going to mean anything is so they thought they were to restock their farm system as a way to go the Dodgers have a pool expectation of competing at twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nOr and so if they do keep a curse off of who is still a front end of the rotation\nHaving less philosophy that says ask like getting your strike out with your ... is he still is an elite level pitcher or if it's not here are gonna have to replace them\nAnd there's not an obvious replacement out there on the market this off season so you know that all has to play into the decision for them or you know that's an elite level pitcher that it's going to be very tough to replace\nIf the ...
