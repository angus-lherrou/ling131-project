I mean that's all he did you get all hopefully it warms up so you can ask all not just going straight in the winter yeah every move on\nYeah so we're now we're pretty pretty excited about what we have going on right now with the ramp holiday is rocks over as well and some really big gift does\nThat we have a New Hampshire and a great collection\nRight down to when you look out there are still have some outlay team left ... dead horse the biggest is the most money optical street other nations march at new bodies down there and getting around in the Austin Diego's nice driving vehicle that one is also going to have needed discounts\nOn some of the vehicles are looking at her own seven thousand dollars off brand new leader going to go around and then one of the ... as much just Thirteen thousand dollars off in some cases so well you know the best thing to do is sit down with us so we can go through all the different ... that are available because it\nCan be different for different ... or there's a rebate it has to do with farming with traditional aid there's rebate they'd have to do it you know somebody that maybe as a vehicle different brand in the driveway\nOr if you're returning let's see you're getting ... rebate money so there's just a lot of other savings that are available above and beyond get a better at the Cape\nSo that's why they're just coming to look and see what you all for it\nYeah it it's always good to visit because there are so many options I mean everything from from the first time you're going to look into this or you've done a day every year are you looking at least saying I mean there really is a lot of options and it really depends on kind of your price range doesn't it\nSet it up I'm not saying you're guilty I miss you need a citation this isn't an admission of guilt um it's what it is\nI'm giving you the ticket you the truth to pay it or go to court and find it at your hospital that you're right and I'm guessing Ninety five percent of the time the person knows they did it and probably pass right I'm guessing name yeah most I think ... probably higher than that I had some you\nKnow and I just interrupt us or you know the one thing to as some of them are mandatory appearances you W eyes and some of those you do have to appear that yeah there's a number of them that you can pay but there are just let you know that there are some that are mandatory appearances\nOkay at the end the ones that I had just read off the DWI one would probably be down in the eyes are mandatory parents as the school bus stop our dining room stuff like that is that's not mandatory okay failure to your only American ... actually the gross misdemeanor ones are probably mandatory parents this [laughter] [noise]\nSo and that would be like the DWI yeah 'cause 'cause those are and you get someone to go to court for those how do you\nDo the uh how do you get the information on a DWI is a ... um because\nThe the other one said within four hours you can you can issue a citation or or violation but on the details you why if you don't\nWitness it how does how does that callers call it in given his plates given us their license plates description of the vehicle things like that okay but what they're calling is what weaving in and sure I'm leaving Saudi radically they had the edge yeah OK I'm OK in in a case like that\nAnd they give you a plate number or whatever and so you go to you you obviously you know who it is 'cause you run the place you go to that person in and talk to them or do you do you automatically\nGive them a violation because it's circumstantial ... circumstances very\nIt varies some trying to think that that just seems a little more difficult now has more difficult to do it you know I just had an issue two weeks ago or we could go on or off duty officers is almost T bone an intersection and I was thirty two of the hour and a red light\nAlmost on him and his wife um and uh I he was following the gallon pulled her over north into town here and Yup I ran the red light okay and she got a ticket okay I\nWas there well doesn't matter I guess and she got a ticket for running delight corrupt she did okay and then that was because and that was even though you didn't witness it the other person did they called it in it was an off duty police officer or even if it wasn't an off duty police officer she was going to get a ticket to rent a red light Khamenei she admitted it but she was still going to get one [noise]\nShe didn't run or anything or keep driving now but she did she pull over right away yeah as soon as she ran the red light no she actually caught in our town okay so I was away a lot of the not no she ... she knew\nOkay so I was away a lot of the ... no she ... she knew\nBut she kept going in hopes that she will and was going to turn herself and she was open on who's going to color in okay so I've been to a police officer is right behind her off duty ... and and this and in combination question here um could that off duty police officer of stopped her no\nThey can't do that should not to you had no citizens rental new address list you know or\nThat so he had the right thing ... was on duty correct you guy you ... just okay\nWhich seems to be always not only the safest but just I mean everything goes and procedure then right perfectly okay All right now so okay uh ... the reason I say oh sorry we'll get to the DWI in just a moment I'm Sorry I wasn't paying any attention Jackie saying there's a phone call if you would pay attention I'm Sorry Jackie and\nWe will let's go to the phones and uh say good morning and thanks for waiting Iran open I legal Tuesday go ahead\nOh God I'm an adult enough I don't know I call it out on them that\nMm [noise] I Can't speak to that I don't know I guess we're supposed to carry on and\nSo what what one thing that if the vehicle is gone I mean we have to be able if you're going to write a ticket you have to be able to identify the driver I mean you've got to the plate number and a ... who owns a vehicle but you still have got it and we still have to know who was driving and so on and what information did you give them\nSome number to call the car\nAnd then on I ... I was laid off your car I should come out of the gum and a car and drive\nUp to mount an eye on them because they didn't\n[laughter] ...\n[laughter] okay but officer a massive what you're saying is you can if somebody were to call it in yeah I don't it's unfortunate that happened and I don't know I Can't I Can't speak to those details or anything about it so sorry that happened\nYeah it was a I I agree with Ryan ... uh uh information should have been passed on I don't know if it was a uh did you talk to an officer or did you talk to a dispatcher\n[noise] go after the older\nOkay it could've been maybe it was new dispatcher or someone who wasn't aware I mean there are obviously just a mistake or some sort of but that that should have been passed along so normally it would be\nSo in your case for some ... eyes get called in people driving and that's how we get some a lot of our DWI's\nIs on planes [noise] it was a kite Jane thanks for the call appreciate it a case it already is the way they're somewhere okay yeah 'cause 'cause we were just saying ... or maybe they knew there was nobody well of course they said because we didn't witness that\nA lot of times you call in and there's just nobody around nobody close and by the time you get to where the fractures occur you know obviously there are gone\nOkay there are there are things that could be tough if they just called to say I'm driving and I'm thirty two I'm and I'm north of town here a couple of miles and I see a vehicle comes by me and I don't catch the play but they're weaving in and out if I called and there's nobody in the vicinity\nOf hide and top three of 'em and less you were like a you know coming down there for you know coming our way be able to see them coming to town and then you could see you and you're not always in the right position right I can understand that but if if they are able to get a a full license plate make color whatever\nI'm good how do you guys can yeah check into that so okay\nBut here's what I was going to get it thanks for the call by the way sixty one twelve thirty on a pizza tax line you can you can send your questions in or you can call us if they want to alter my question is got to be tougher on the DWI\nBecause um you know somebody calls and you don't have all the information and you're trying to follow up on it and you didn't see it I mean what are the process is there how do you have to go back out to be pretty specific I mean I knew color information you know one of the big\nThings is if this goes to court as person might have to testify in what they saw you know I mean if they just call and hang up the phone [noise] doesn't really give me a lot mhm um\nI can go and see if I can find the vehicle and watch driving behavior and pull him over on my own so one you know it'd be a successful one Ryan ... I've had many successful they call and leave their name and say what they witnessed uh-huh and I pulled him over I I I get a bind the vehicle and they're doing exactly what the caller stated they were doing and I pull them over and they're drunk\nIt's perfect okay\nThat's ... that's where we're going to work so well for you guys on that a correct okay yes\nI've been for our thing is for a hit and run and or even seen of accidents that kind of stuff we're ah someone gets in an accident and uh they leave and the other person the other person and the other car gets to play a number of seats who it is and maybe even those who it is and then so you have that for hours to find that's one of\nThe things I wanted to ask about 'cause a lot of most of these all with the exception of the D. W. I. all say within four hours\n[laughter] yeah yeah it's the newness of it and for hours it's kind of the standard it's kind of ... let's put it this way if someone so I don't find them in four hours but then maybe I find them the next day and they're like yeah my intention was not\nTo leave the scene of a crash you know they're still going to get a ticket ... 'cause nobody\nReally seems different I mean that's your will get it to pass on information yeah so so it goes it says ... doesn't mean they don't get a citation okay so I can go farther alternate yeah than four hours and they're talking about the four hours a for actual arrest in front of the uh I mean I understand what you're saying I mean that that's actually arrested him as opposed to a citation\n\nOkay sixty one twelve thirty six day one one two three zero number to call if you have any legal questions I have one other one on the state patrol um question and the question that was set in was\nIs it a violation if the third brake light quick working on a passenger vehicle and what about a vehicle that his equipped to break lights that a flash or Paul said\nA and the answer from the state trooper or the state statute says that a vehicle equipped with stop lamps or signal lamp shell at all times we maintain a good working condition so all break lights including the third one would have to be operational when activated flashing lights are prohibited except\nOn an authorized emergency vehicles school bus bicycle road maintenance equipment tow truck or telling vehicle service vehicle farm tractor self propelled farm equipment a rural mail\nCarrier vehicle funeral home vehicle or didn't know that one or any a vehicle as a means of indicating a right or left turn obviously with liquor then\nI'm frequently walk around your vehicle and check all the lights turn signals etc to make sure everything's in in good order but\nBut I found to be not true I mean it's like this where there was actually something that person should be up\nEspecially to the fullest extent especially something like this because that could affect your business your livelihood you know it's one thing and say come in and say I Ryan was speeding and I guess I was lying about that okay that's your story falsely reported a crime but I'm not going to have a huge ramifications you a few somebody a rape that's a big\nDeal he absolutely yes huge no no no doubt no doubt that's a ... and this is this is what's a you know the the knees he said she said cases are there are some of the worst ones I well\nAnd this is this is why these becoming a common question because uh uh could it be true could it'd be false that's ... million dollar question\nSix eight one twelve thirty six eight one twelve thirty or number to call a calls comments questions or would love to hear from you I'm anything happening in fact we have seen them and we have ...\n... um I completely forgot that on a reasonable circumstances we can exceed with all my life in science so I did forget that that is\nSay that again and we can exceed the speed limit on a reasonable circumstances responded alarms things like that where we can ever lights and sirens on to go to certain calls coal so you can or can't we can you can okay us so I ... on you though\nWell yeah but some of that stuff um be irate liability is on us but I mean you're not going to a hundred miles an hour with\nMy license with all my life returns on but you drive with care I mean you got to be reasonable about it okay well ... yeah\nBut it's not an emergency there's no reason that you wouldn't be any ways or all of the some of those\nEarly holdup alarm things like that you don't want to let them know you come and we don't want to do so well all all the ... and\nThey had ever thought of that yeah I never thought of that\nWhich which reminds me of a story I had an officer pull up right by me without lights and sirens on and uh he kind of snuck up on me pretty quick I was I was taking down some wiring a of a speaker system outside a bank\nWhen I inadvertently set off alarm evidently in the bank owned by doing that and the it was it was during after goof fest you are a number of years ago and I was taking down all the way I I lined up the wires with the the the the PA orange and stuff that you're the parade\nAnd I was taking everything down on I don't know if it was a Sunday night or whatever it was taken everything out outside the ... and I don't know if I could touch the building he touched a window whatever I did I evidently set off a silent\nAlarm and uh one of the shares a ... game pulling up you know just pull up normal and what's going on up there and somebody I Know well I was just ... gone blah blah blah ... by the way you set off the alarm oh sorry about that\nIdea where did I get anything [laughter] like you were looking down the barrel her shotgun or something so that would have been the case if there was an actual\nI'm a bank robbery going on they would've approach them different out differently than they may have been coming fast but not at the lights and sirens flashing the alright okay now I got ya [noise]\nAll right um at least two packages sent to the Pentagon suspected to contain rice and according to officials this just came out here at least two packages are sent to the Pentagon on Tuesday a suspected of containing I think as I say at rice and writing and writing yeah\nAccording to a Pentagon spokesman the packages made their way into Pentagon but were flagged in the mail delivery building next door the FBI FBI has the lead on the investigation that they all the information just came across this morning show\nWe haven't we haven't dealt with stuffing envelopes now for a while\nAnyway idea and of course the problem with that is you have to take 'em all seriously whether it's ... or whatever you have to take it seriously until you find out that it's not hazardous because rising some nasty stuff and you you have to assume the worst ...\nSix eight one twelve thirty six eight one twelve thirty is our number to call right I Want to go around the room and and officer\nRyan ... [laughter] around the room\nYou're out first have nothing to say American now we should bring up a the scam here from a couple of weeks ago we had to I don't think I wasn't in here at that time um my wife has got a call this morning that al ... [laughter] ... yeah I was an iris one okay\nIt was great it was a different well yeah and they just there was a message saying she was going to get arrested\nBut that's the that's the one isn't it yeah I got to okay but that's the one that came up here a couple of weeks ago that it was significant we're all day long all all day long\n... they were going to hit in our area pretty hard at that time and one person did fall for it really scared\nAnd uh I've\nGot her to come down to the police department and we had a conversation and she realized it was a bunch of BS and we've spoken\nI actually spoke to the guy in the fall and I was talking to her really yeah really yeah he he he didn't believe that I was a cop and he started to swear at me on the phone\nAnd really yeah he was mad at me were you able to get any and all he hung up on me now okay I like playing with them a little bit because he didn't he didn't appreciate\nI mean I was a nice I'll be honest all the one that called your wife know the one that called this lady last week and got her to fall for this Ira stuff or did he leave like a number to call back I actually got on the phone to them and\nHe convinced her to go and buy things and yeah so\nShe drove to the police department luckily I was on a cell phone yeah luckily I'm In her boyfriend I convinced her to drive and the police department and she was telling the cell phones and the guy she was driving around thinking there was a warrant for arrest and the cops are coming to get her and uh I got on the ship all up a phone from her and I had about it\nAnd uh I got on the show up on the phone from her and I had about a thirty second conversation with the guy and he did not appreciate me at all and uh yeah she she had she went and bought some things and uh she's all the money\nI'm over two hundred some box and Google Play cards and things\nYeah that's what they were looking for ... yeah\nAnd and that might have gone there is no hanging out once you send it\nShe has gone so there's nothing I can do for you [noise] so\nWhat are the things to the cops aren't that it would then who who did they started with what was the IRS right yeah this is what it was it was the IRS yup which there the IRS is not going to send the ... no they're not going to call first of the other one was okay right away to the mail right to hire expert out in the mail a right away hang up and and I would caution you\nToo if you get something from the IRS in the mail I Would make sure you check it out to make sure that's legitimate could that's going to be the next one now nobody's answering the phone so now we're going to send them stuff in the mail so check it out\nBut the one thing on my my thought was interesting it said that if if you don't pay this and do this the cops are going to come and get you sauce and not to share of law enforcement rate the cops are going to come and get your cats are going to get Senate mine was on a cell phone or on my answering machine 'cause I Would love to have been this you know we've had some fun with this but it was on the answering machine so I never get um\nI I had one and then the guy got mad at me because I was playing dumb hung up on me I knew you were secret lobbyists and I know it's just it's\nSo hard because it's I don't have the last couple of days and I I look at the number and it's no one was to from New York one was from a\nSomewhere else I Can't remember what that can Minnesota I guess I Wonder if at least once a week or or maybe twice a day sometimes with are from there I mean that's what I'm ...

to be going around a lot this year and you know a lot of teams in quarterbacks getting help from the referee I don't know and I've\nSaid this and I'm not age ... age is is that it so I just wonder about the referees and maybe you need younger guys out there to keep up with everything I I'm Serious when I say that and I'm not saying if you're fifty you can't do the job but there's so many mistakes made\nI'd I don't even know than the NFL how those guys live with themselves like ... it happens all the time Chris\nRight it it makes what you're saying it makes sense I mean we're talking about sports I used to look at it in the NBA addict ... who was a tremendous referee in the NBA but I don't know he was in his seventies only retire how in the world is a Seventy year old keeping up on the court were twenty five year old\nI that's what I'm saying and then they end up selling in the NFL they can't they always behind in the play I don't know if they they they see this stuff\nWhat what's going on I don't even think that they even know all the rules sometimes sometimes I'm just like how little the referees know that you\nCan't do that don't want to get a job the referee from last night who said his only\nJob is to watch the clock [laughter] the play clock which hit zero before Patrick her home\nAnd he didn't have a huge play was a huge play with a humongous\nOr should have been a touchdown I don't know how that receiver stumbled in fellow but ah yeah big play and you know of course it didn't get called wasn't review of bull but now that\nThe story of the night though is not the referee Rob it was Patrick my home and I know you saw the left hand it past the through\nSay these are all going to be dragged down and and he ... he changes hands and tosses the ball\nRoute attain a yard completion something like that for first down I Believe it was the cream hunt or just look I I Love these not people we talked about this before with Jared golf\nBut people

not at all four hours a day sport and of course there were no you know undisputed them first tapes and all these debates shows on TV I don't know if that leads to\nPeople over ... things I I I think\nA part of it is is that you gotta have something every day to feed the dump the monitor now and it's the same thing it's not like when people talk about even like a on the news and they say oh you know all all this stuff is like the world come if you watch any of the news channels white and for a length of time you think the world\nComing to an end everything is like a magic likes to oh my

I Know you don't understand it but I'm I'm going to explain that people want to find all this historical significance after four games because ultimately it ultimately it's self serving the person who claimed that down the road they can stay\nOr game then what I call it right\nNow what is wrong like look at Roger war ski now\nRight I get it but you're right though most people would rather do that let's let me jump in now and then uh if it doesn't work out they just say well I mean what I started out and looked like he was going to be great I didn't know what was going to fall off the next year right\nYeah it's much easier to walk it back to walking forward you want to be able to say I called it I saw it and I was\nThe walking forward you want to be able to say I called it I saw it and I was right and if they don't make it you say well it off at the coordinator changed his weapons and now\nYou're still [laughter] so um I think it's a game that the the talkers like to play on on TV you\nKnow they go good call Cruz pre shaded eight seven seven Ninety nine or ... what about Michael in Wisconsin you're on the odd couple of Fox Sports radio which got\nHey what's up yeah hey up at what the guy's a time machine I Want to go all the way back to two thousand and three\nBig Bend them all the students were old and four right now I'm going to come to the game he goes Fifteen and want\nNobody to talk like this about him\nAt all nobody said anything oh you the greatest of all time you just you know they said oh he's got that when a playoff game when ... right yeah I went another playoff game he went one and then when the championship game he loses that\nPeople still nowadays don't we talk about Big Bend like that and I actually asked them Patrick the same thing\nAnd you know where he said well you have so many big target them so much good things around them more than Joe Montana\nWho hadn't Patrick my home why that's a whole lot that he has no weapons you know my my weapons around them no doubt about that\nPlays into what we were saying earlier Rob with two thousand and three that was before like the TI was really the first quote unquote debate talk show on I mean you had an old sports reporters you know yeah yeah\nBut the TI kind of kicked off his new wave of shows and that was around oh three or so when they were started right around that time so you didn't have this proliferation of shows we're talking heads on them every day\nTalking about these guys and it works both ways you know when you when the guys doing well it can lead to over praise when a guy struggling\nA or has a bad game the pollen on British says right like like LeBron James if he has a bag game a Tuesday night and January in Utah they miss is a a last second shot\nMiss going to be talked about at ... pm the next day when Michael Jordan played that wasn't the case so we we don't really remember the misses that Jordan hat or the bad moments that Jordan hat we really only tend to remember the great with the way it works both ways\nBut I think that was a great call in and I do think\nThe new atmosphere of TV shows radio talk shows I think all of that uh plays into this route\nNo doubt about it we got the squeeze one more in before we get an update how about Eric in Long Beach you're on the odd couple of Fox Sports radio what's happening Eric\nHow are you guys doing I I just wanted to say what what what ... is like third or fourth year when they made the greatest players of all time yeah I mean we didn't we didn't have to wait to see you know ten years from now than it was going to be great we saw it right away\nYou know but the different the different I think that was premature to was it was premature but it was three years not four games if Shaq was pulling the fifty greatest\nA list after four games in the NBA or saying equivalent say twenty five games I think that would have been a stretch and of course I think you're right it was ...\nYeah yeah I 'cause I remember that was in Cleveland it was for that I remember that I've been here all star game was Ninety six or Ninety seven Ninety seven I think Ninety seven and and all the fifty Grameen that we will show up\nReally know because you would have been there for the all star game I thought ... wasn't there for the pickier I didn't take well he may have missed the picture he may well I'm going to get out\nI'm almost positive he missed the the picture like a once in a lifetime picture you know what I mean of of all players and I always remember I always\nThought I might be true I was told I mean but you might be right\nThat's what I remember that he wasn't in the ... the the big picture for everybody and\nI now he was it was his fifth year I still think it was pretty mature but it was his fifth year not his third year and obviously is not viewed it better than out of the reason yeah yeah I mean we're talking about four games right now right but it was new Ewan myself a lot of other writers thought it was premature\nObviously turned out to be accurate but I think basketball's a little different\nThere'll be a love fest going on but you know things were said microphones get shoved in people's faces and they react or whatever [noise] um he's not the only problem you know him not being there they still have problems they just love your bell right now\nWe're talking with Brian ball the NFL Network analyst if you want to get them at Twitter it's at ball the NFL\nAnd Brian ... the ah the jets got off to that so unbelievable all day one and we should say a and a score forty eight points in Detroit and it hasn't been the same uh since what's going on there and uh\nAnd it hasn't been the same uh since what's going on there and uh is it all on the quarterback or or or they have other issues [noise]\nNo no I I I think the quarterback is\nHe's doing the best that he can right now they're not a very good team around them\nAre quite frankly uh they went into the you know the they went down to actually sold the best defensive football and um they they just couldn't compete was Eighteen nothing and they they couldn't do anything against them I mean Jacksonville is just sound in every position and if you're dropping passes or your protection isn't good\nOr you're running ridiculous routes on thirty one word and receivers are running ten yards down the field tried to get open on the third one that\nYou know the the whole thing is just it's kind of crumbling I thought to essentially that would play a little bit better especially with for net going out [noise] but um you know they don't have an elite past Russia there they've got a great safety and Jamal Adams that does a lot of things they've got some good individual players on defense they just can't shut teams completely down right now\nBryan Robin I started the show talking about Patrick my home and I mean you can't help but love you made this point but\nWe just think people need it too early to crown him you know the greatest quarterback average fan or something like yeah I mean we we think people might be going a bit overboard even though I I Love what I see and I think it's sustainable\nOr what are your thoughts on the homes in in ways ... stereo over him my at all or\nWell I've heard all the comparisons to Elway and far but you know all this stuff which is which is natural people get hyped um you know it does make the game of football fun again I mean you can sit back last night and just enjoy a football game I tweeted out at twelve forty seven to go to the fourth quarter when he got the ball to twenty five\nDoubt pen the Patrick homes you know air officially begins let's see if he brings team back and he did and it did it in a variety of ways I\nI played up there at mile high Chris seven times I never want to gain I never caught my breath that guy was\nChased all over that field ... he's the only one that wasn't\nRaining hard he just played it ... it was just fun and it's entertaining I'm going to be in a Kansas City this weekend for the actual game it's going to be the best against the best I mean he was tested fourth quarter comeback at mile high that you put that in your belt is going to see the links best effects this weekend\nYou know Ryan great job man we're ...
